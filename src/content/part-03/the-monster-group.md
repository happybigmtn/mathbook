for every a, b, c, d ∈ Z such that ad − bc = 1. (The
reason we exclude the case ad − bc = −1 is that (aτ +
b)/(cτ +d) would not be in the upper half-plane in this
case.) This is the equation at the heart of the definition     parametrized by a fairly simple set: the set of all posi-
of a modular form.
  Over the years, mathematicians have isolated other
desirable properties that F should have in order to give
a useful theory. Nowadays, modular forms are required
to obey the additional properties that F is holomor-
phic [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and that F (x + iy) does not grow too
quickly as y goes to +. nfty; these assumptions imply that
the vector space of weight k modular forms is finite
dimensional. The Eisenstein series above do have these
additional properties, and are the first basic examples
of modular forms.

Modular forms have connections with arithmetic, ge-
ometry, representation theory, and even physics. Mod-
ular forms also played a key role in the Taylor–Wiles
proof of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem). Why is this?
One general reason is that there are links between mod-
ular forms and other mathematical objects: here we
briefly explain one of the links.
   Lattices in the complex plane are related to elliptic
curves [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves): the quotient of the complex numbers
by a lattice is an elliptic curve, and every elliptic curve   theorem, the Monster group has remarkable and deep
arises in this way. Hence to study elliptic curves, or fam-   connections with other areas of mathematics. Most
ilies of elliptic curves, one can instead study families
of lattices. One way of studying an object is by study-
ing the functions on that object, and a modular form
is precisely that: a function on the collection of all lat-   “elliptic modular function” (see algebraic numbers
tices. And indeed, automorphic forms, which are gen-
eralizations of modular forms, have been used to great
effect in studying a wide variety of families of algebraic     1 is a manifestation of a very deep connection between
objects in this way.
III.60   Moduli Spaces
An important general problem in mathematics is clas-
sification (see the general goals of mathematical
research [I.4 §2](/part-01/general-goals)). Often, one has a set of mathematical
structures and a notion of equivalence, and one would
like to describe the equivalence classes [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar).
For example, two (compact, orientable) surfaces are
often regarded as equivalent if each can be continu-
ously deformed into the other. Each equivalence class
is then fully described by the genus [III.33](/part-03/genus), or “number     polynomial P . For example, if you are designing a
of holes,” in the surface.

III. Mathematical Concepts
Topological equivalence is rather “crude,” in the
sense that it is relatively easy for two surfaces to be
equivalent. As a result, the equivalence classes are
tive integers. But there are many geometrical contexts
in which finer notions of equivalence are important.
For example, in several contexts one wishes to regard
two two-dimensional lattices [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms) as equivalent if
one is a rotation and enlargement of the other. Equiv-
alence relations such as this one often lead to param-
eter sets that themselves have an interesting geomet-
rical structure. Such sets are called moduli spaces. For
details, see [IV.8](/part-04/moduli-spaces) and also [V.23](/part-05/mostows-strong-rigidity-theorem).

one of the landmarks of twentieth-century mathemat-
ics. As its name suggests, it gives a complete descrip-
tion of all finite simple groups, which can be thought
of as the building blocks for all finite groups. It states
that each finite simple group belongs to one of eighteen
infinite families, or else is one of twenty-six “sporadic”
examples. The Monster group is the largest of these
sporadic groups, with 808 017 424 794 512 875 886 459
904 961 710 757 005 754 368 000 000 000 elements.
As well as having a starring role in the classification
notably, the smallest dimension of a faithful re pre sen-
tation [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) of the Monster group is 196 883, while
the coefficient of e2π iz in the important and famous
[IV.1 §8](/part-04/number-theory)) is 196 884. Far from being an amusing coin-
cidence, the fact that these two numbers differ by just
the two. See vertex operator algebras [IV.17 §4.2](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras)
for further details.
