Then a permutation is odd if sgn(g) = −1.g \in  Sn is even if sgn(g) = +1, and It follows easily from the definition that sgn(gh) = sgn(g) sgn(h) for any2-cycle is$g$, h - 1. Since an \in Sn, and also that the signature of anyr -cycle (a a · · · a ) can be expressed as a product2-cycles, the signature of the(a1 arr)(a - cycle i(s1)1 ar-2 1()-· · ·1)r-((ar)1. Hence$,1 a2) of$ ifg \in  Sn has cycle-shape (r1$, r2$, . . . , rk), then$sgn$(g) = (-1)^r^1^-^1(-1)^r^2^-^1 · · · (-1)^r^k^-^1. This makes it easy to work out the signature of any per-mutation.
For example, the even permutations in$S^{5} are$ those that have cycle-shape$(1^{5})$, (22, 1), (3, 12)$, or (5)$. If you count these, you will find that there are sixty even permutations in S5 altogether, which is exactly half of the total of 5!number of even permutations in= 120 permutations in S is (S5)1. In general, then!. The answer is that the set of all even permutations in forms a subgroup of size So what is the point of this complicated definition?1$n$!, known as the$n^{2} alternating S^{n}$ group of degree groups are very important examples of finite groups,$n$, and written as2 An.
The alternating because of the fact that, for$n ⩾ 5$, An is a simple group—that is, its only are the identity subgroup and normal subgroups An itself (see the clas-[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) sification of finite simple groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups)).

This very familiar phenomenon is actually rather mysterious, because it shows that the properties of the chemical H O do not depend continuously on temperature: the block of ice goes straight from a solid to a liquid, rather than doing so by a process of gradual2 softening.

For further discussion of such models, seeena [IV.25].probabilistic models of critical phenom - 261 III.70π What makes one number more fundamental and impor - tant, mathematically speaking, than another?
Why, for instance, would almost everybody agree that 2 is more important than 43 ? One possible answer is that what really matters about a number is its properties, and in particular any interesting properties it might have that32 distinguish it from all other numbers. Of course, wenow have to decide what counts as an interesting property: for example, why do we not regard it as interesting that 43 is the only number that gives you 43 when you double it? An obvious reason is that there is an analo - 32 16 gous property for choose:
x is the only number that gives you 2 every number x you might care tox when you double it. By contrast, the property “is the smallest prime number” does not mention any specific number and is easily stated in terms of a concept, that of “prime number,” whose importance is itself easy to explain. This property must apply to exactly one number, so itis likely that that number will have an important part to play in mathematics, and indeed it does.
(As it happens,43 is conjectured to be an important critical exponent in statistical physics, which means that it32 can be singled out as an interesting number, though still nothing like as fundamental as 2.) Everybody agrees thatπ is one of the most important numbers in mathematics, and it is easy to justify this assessment by the criterion of the previous paragraph, becauseπhas an abundance of properties—so many that whenis not unduly surprised.
For example, the following isπ appears unexpectedly in a calculation, one a famous theorem of euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783):$\infty 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · = π2$.n2 4 9 16 25 6 n = 1 adding up reciprocals of squares? This is a perfectly What on earth, one might wonder, hasπ to do with legitimate question, but the idea that there could inprinciple be a connection is not, to an experienced mathematician, a surprise. A very common way to prove mathematical identities is to show that the two sides of the identity are different ways of evaluating the same quantity.
In this case, one can use a basic fact from identity fourier analysis, which states the following. If[III.27](/part - 03/the - fourier - transform), known as$f$: Plancherel’s R$\to C \text{is a}$ periodic function with period 2π, and for every inte- ger n(positive or negative) we define itsnth Fourier

If you now take asis between(2 n -1 f)πthe function that is 1 whenever and (2 n +1)π for some integer xn works out as, and 0 otherwise, then you find that the left-hand side1.

This closely resembles the identity we were trying to prove, which we can get by noticing that the right-hand side is equal toquarters of 1$/(nn)21$. Therefore,/n2 - n 1/(2 n)1/n2$, \text{which is three}2 = π2/6$. comes up in the formula for the Fourier coefficients. Now we have a reason for the appearance ofnn π: it What is more, its appearance there can be explained aswell. A periodic function on R is more naturally thought of as a function defined on the unit circle.
The Fourier coefficient circle, so we have to divide by the length of the circle,$an$is a certain average defined on the unit which is 2π. What, then, isπ? Well, we have just seen what is perhaps the most elementary definition: it is the ratio ofthe circumference of a circle to its diameter. But what makesπso interesting is that it has many different defining properties. Here are a few more of them. (i) Define a function sinx to be equal to the sum of the power series

The presence of the factor 1 The last formula above is a remarkable recent discov-/16 k leads to a way of calcu- lating hexadecimal digits ofπ (that is, digits to base 16), with out needing to work out all the earlier digits first. It has been used to work out digits that are
astonishingly far along the hexadecimal expansion: for exam-ple, it is known that the trillionth hexadecimal digit is 8. (See[VIII.5 §7](/part-08/mathematics-an-experimental-science) for a further discussion of this formula.)mathematics: an experimental science A fact that seems paradoxical to many non mathematicians is that a number as natural asto be irrational, and also transcendentalπ turns out[III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers). However, this is not surprising at all:
the defining prop-erties ofπ are simple, but they do not lead to solutions of polynomial equations, so it would be extraordinary ifπ were not transcendental. Similarly, it would be a major surprise if one could find any pattern in the dec-imal digits ofπ. Indeed, π is conjectured to be normal to base with about the frequency you would expect: for exam - 10, meaning that every sequence of digits occurs ple, if you look at pairs of consecutive digits, then you expect 35 to occur about a hundredth of the time.
However, this conjecture seems to be very hard, and it hasnot even been proved that the decimal expansion ofπ contains all the digits from 0 to 9 infinitely often. III.71. Probability Distributions III.71 Probability Distributions James Norris 1 Discrete Distributions When we toss a coin, we have no idea whether it will land heads or tails. However, there is a different sense in which the behavior of the coin is highly predictable: if it is tossed many times, then the proportion of heads is very likely to be close to 12.
In order to study this phenomenon mathematically, we need to model it, and this is done by defining a sample space, which represents the set of possible out comes, and awhich tells you their probabilities. In the case of a coin, probability distribution on that space, the natural sample space is the setous distribution assigns the number. 11, Tto each element.\}, and the obvi- Alternatively, since we are interested in the number of heads, we could use the set$\\{0}$, 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. instead:
after one2 toss, there is a probability of heads is 0 and a probability of12 1 that the number ofthat it is 1. More generally, a (discrete) sample space is simply a set2Ω, and a probability distribution oning a nonnegative real number to each element ofΩ is a way of assign-Ω in such a way that the sum of all these numbers is 1. The number assigned to a particular element of interpreted as the probability that some correspondingΩ is then out come will occur, the total probability being 1.
IfΩ is a set of size n, then the uniform distribution on ability of 1Ω is the probability distribution that assigns a prob-/n to each element of Ω. However, it is often more appropriate to assign different probabilities todifferent out comes. For example, given any real number parameterp between 0 and 1, thep on the set \\{0, 1 Bernoulli distribution with\\} is the distribution that assigns the numberp to 1 and 1 - p to 0. This can be used to model the toss of a biased coin.
If we are interested in the out come of every toss, thenwe would choose the sample space consisting of all pos-Suppose now that we toss an unbiased coinn times. sible sequences of 0 s and 1 s of len gthn = 5, a typical element of the sample space is 01101.n.

Not being very good at darts, I am not able to say very much about where the dart will land, but I can at least try to model it probabilistic ally. The obvious sample space to take consists of a circular disk, the points of which represent where the dart lands. However, now there is a problem: if I look at any particular point in the disk, the probability that the dart will land at precisely that point iszero. So how do I define a probability distribution?
be perfectly easy to make sense of a question such as A clue to the answer lies in the fact that it seems to “What is the probability that I will hit the bull’s-eye?”In order to hit the bull’s-eye, the dart has to land in a certain region of the board, and the probability ofthis happening does not have to be zero. It might, for instance, be equal to the area of the bull’s-eye region divided by the total area of the board. assign probabilities to individual space, we can still hope to give probabilities to What we have just observed is that even if we cannot points in the sample subsets.
That is, ifcan try to assign a numberΩ is a sample space and P(A) between 0 and 1 to the A is a subset of Ω, we set out come belongs to the set A. This represents the probability that the random A, and can be thought of as something like a notion of “mass” for the set For this to work, we need P(Ω) to be 1 (since the A. probability of getting something in the sample space must be 1). Also, ifthen P(A∪B) should be A and P(A)B+are disjoint subsets of P(B). From this it followsΩ, that ifis equal to$A^{1}$, . . . , AP(An)+· · ·+are all disjoint, then P(A ).
Actually, it turns out to P(A1 ∪ · · · ∪An) be important that this should be true not just for finite unions but even for1 countably infini ten [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets) ones as well. (Related to this point is the fact that one does not attempt to define P(A) for every subset A of Ω but just for measurable subsets [III.55](/part-03/measures). For our purposes, III.

3 Continuous Probability Distributions There are three particularly important distributions defined on subsets of R, of which two will be discussed in this section. The first is thethe interval[0,1]. We would like to capture the idea uniform distribution on that “all points inthe problems mentioned above, how should we do this?[0, 1]are equally likely.” In view of Although we cannot calculate the mass of an object by A good way is to take seriously the “mass” metaphor. adding up the masses of all the infinitely small points that make up the object, we can assign to those points ado here.
We assign a density and integrate it. That is exactly what we shall probability density of 1 to each point in the interval ability of a subinterval,[0,1][. Then we determine the prob - 1,1] say, by calculating the integral P([1 3$,1 2]) =1 (1/)/3 2 1 d3 x2 = 1 6$. More generally, the probability associated with an intervalbe its len gthb - a. The probability of a union of dis-[a, b] will just joint intervals will then be the sum of the lengths of those intervals, and so on.
arises naturally from requirements of symmetry, just This “continuous” uniform distribution some times like its discrete counterpart. It can also arise as a lim-iting distribution. For instance, suppose that a hermit lives deep in a cave, away from any clocks or sources of natural light, and that each “day” he spends lasts for a random length of time between twenty-three and twenty-five hours.
To start with, he will have some idea of what the time is, and be able to make statements such as, “I’m having lunch now, so it’s probably light out side,” but after a few weeks of this regime, he will no longer have any idea: any out side time will be justas likely as any other. Now let us look at a rather more interesting density function, which depends on the choice of a positive con - stantλ. Consider the density function f (x) = λ(e-). ambda x, defined on the set of all nonnegative real numbers. To work out the probability associated with an interval III.71.

The exponen - time T of a spontaneous event, such as the time it takes for a radioactive nucleus to decay, or for the next spam email to arrive. The reason for this is based on the assumption of memorylessness:
for example, if we know that the nucleus remains intact at time probability that it will remain intact until a later times, thes + t is the same as the original probability that it would remain intact to time ability that the nucleus remains intact up to timet. Let G(t) represent the prob - t. Then the probability that it remains intact up to times + t given that it has remained intact up to time s is G(s + t)/G(s), so this has to equal G(t). Equivalently$, G(s + t) = G(s)G(t)$.
The only decreasing functions that have this property are[III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions), that is, functions of the form exponential functions G(t) = (e-). ambda t for some positiveλ. Since 1 - G(t) represents the proba- bility that the nucleus decays before time equ alt f (x) dx, from which it is easy to deduce thatt, this shouldf (x) =0λ(e-). ambda x .

tribution below. We shall come to the third, and most important, dis4 Random Variables, Mean, and Variance Given a probability space, an(sufficiently nice) subset of that space. For example, if event is defined to be a the probability space is the interval form distribution, then the interval$[[^{1}0$,,11]]is an event: itwith the uni represents a randomly chosen number between 0 and1 turning out to be at least 1. It is often useful to think2 not just about random events, but also about random2 numbers ple, let us look once again at a sequence of tosses of aassociated with a probability space.
For exam biased coin that has probabilityp of coming up heads. The natural sample space associated with this exper-iment is the setΩ of all sequences ω of 0 s and 1 s. Earlier, we showed that the probability of obtaining heads isp = n pk(1 - p()n)-k, and we described thatk as a distribution on the sample space$kk \\{0}$,1,2, . . . , n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. However, it is in many ways more natural, and often far more convenient, to regard the original setΩ as the sample space and to define a function X from Ω to R to represent the number of heads: that is, X(ω) is the

265

number of 1 s in the sequenceω. We then write P(X = k) = pk = nk pk(1 - p()n)-k. A function like this is called a random variable and it takes values in a set random variable Y, then the. If X is a distribution of Y by the formula of X is the function Pde fin ed on subsets $P (A) = P(X \in A) = P({ω \in Ω}$:$X(ω) \in A)$. It is not hard to see that distribution on Y . P is indeed a probability bution of a random variable.
However, the notion of a random variable defined on a sample space captures For many purposes, it is enough to know the distri our intuition of a random quantity, and it allows us to ask further questions. For example, if we were to askfor the probability that there werek heads given that the first and last tosses had the same out come, then the distribution of X would not provide the answer, where as our richer model of regarding X as a function defined on sequences would do so. Further more, wecan talk of independent random variables,$X^{1}$, . . .

Both these numbers are determined by the dis tr ibu-tion of X. If X takes integer values, with distribution$P$(X = k) = p^k, then$E$(X) = kp^k, var(X) = (k - μ)^2 p^k, where average. The variance, or more precisely its square root,\mu = E(X)k.
The mean tells us how bigk X is on the standard deviation$σ = var(X)$, tells us how far awayderive the following useful alternative formula for the X lies, typically, from its mean. It is not hard to variance: var(X) = E(X2) - E(X)2. To understand the meaning of the variance, consider the following situation. Suppose that one hundred peo-ple take an exam and you are told that their average mark is 75%. This gives you some useful information, but by no means a complete picture of how the marks are distributed.
For example, perhaps the exam consisted of four questions of which three were very easy and one almost impossible, so that all the marks were

266

clustered around 75%. Or perhaps about fifty people got full marks and fifty got around half marks. To model this situation let the sample spaceΩ consist of the hundred people and let the probability distribution bethe uniform distribution. Given a random personω, let X(ω)the variance will be small, since almost everybody’sbe that person’s mark. Then in the first situation, mark is close to the mean of 75%; where as in the second it is close to 252=$625$, since almost everybody’s mark was about 25 away from the mean.
Thus, the variance helps us to understand the difference between the two situations. As we discussed at the start of this article, it is known from experience that the “expected” number of heads in a sequence ofn tosses of a fair coin is around^1 n, in the sense that the proportion is usually close to It is not hard to work out that, if$X \text{models the num} - {}^{212}$. ber of heads intributed with paramete rsn tosses, that is, ifn and1 X, thenis binomially dis-E(X) =1 n.
The variance ofwith which to measure the spread of the distribution X i(s1)4 n, so the natural distance scal(e2)2 is1 with probability close to 1 for large$σ = {}^{12} \sqrt{n}$. This allows us to see thatn X/n, in accordance is close to with experience.2 More generally, if$X1$, X2, . . . , Xn are independent ran- dom variables, then varvar(X ). It follows that if all the(X1+· · ·+Xxn have the same dis-) = var(X1)+· · ·+ tribution with meanance of then sample average\mu and variance$\bar{X}= (n - i)1(Xσ2$, then the vari-+ · · · + X ) isn infinity.
This observation can be used to prove that, for - 2(nσ2) = σ2/n, which tends to zero as1 n tends ton$any$> 0, the probability that |. ar{X}- \mu| is greater than tends to zero asntends to infinity. Thus, the sample average “converges in probability” to the mean This result is called the weak law of large num-\mu. bers that the random variables have finite variance, but this. The argument sketched above implicitly assumes assumption turns out not to be necessary.
There is also a probability 1, the sample average of the first strong law of large numbers, which states that, withn vari- ables converges tosuggests, the strong law is stronger than the weak law,\mu as ntends to infinity. As its name in the sense that the weak law can be deduced from the strong law. Notice that these laws make long-term predictions of a statistical kind about the real events that we have chosen to model using probability theory. More over, these predictions can be checked experimentally, and the experimental evidence confirms them.
This provides a convincing scientific justification forour models.

5 The Normal Distribution andthe Central Limit Theorem As we have seen, for the binomial distribution with paramete rsn and p, the probability p is given by the formula points(k, (pn)k p)kon a graph, then you will notice that they(1 - p()n)-k. If n is large and you plot thek lie in a bell-shaped curve that has a sharp peak around the mean npk. The width of the tall part of the curve has order of magnitude$np(1 - p)$, the standard deviation of the distribution. Let us assume for simplicity that$np$ is an integer, and define a new probability distri but io nq by q = p .
The points (k, q ) peak at k = 0. If you now rescale the graph, compressing horizontally by a factor of(kk()k)+npnp(1 - p) and expanding vertically byk the same factor, then the points will all lie close to the graph of

This is the density function of a famous distribution known as the standard normal distribution on R. It is also often called the Gaussian distribution. number of times, then the number of heads, minus its To put this differently, if you toss a biased coin a large mean and divided by its standard deviation, is close toa standard normal random variable. The function(1/. qrt{2π})(e-x()2()/){2} occurs in a huge variety of mathematical contexts, from probability theory to fourier analysis [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) to quantum mechanics. Why should this be?
The answer, as it is for many such ques-tions, is that there are properties that this function has that are shared by no other function. once again that we are throwing a dart at a dartboard One such property is rotational invariance. Suppose and aiming for the bull’s-eye. We could model this asthe result of adding two independent normal distributions at right angles to each other: one for the di nate and one for they-coordinate (each having meanx-coor- 0 and variance 1, say).
If we do this, then the two-dimensional “density function” is given by the formula (as1/(21π)/2 eπ)-xe(2-)/2 r 2 e/ - 2 y, where2^/2, which can conveniently be writ tenr denotes the length of (x, y). In other words, the density function depends only onthe distance from the origin. (This is why it is called “rotationally invariant.”) This very appealing property holds in more dimensions as well. And it turns out to be quite easy to check that(1/2π)(e-r()2()/){2} is the only such function: more precisely, it is the only rotation invariant density function that makes the coordinates

Notice that for eachof all points of the form(. ambda x, . ambda y, . ambda z) is the line through(x, y, z) the set the origin and definition of the real projective plane is that it is the set(x, y, z), and indeed a more geometrical of all lines in R3 that pass through the origin.
Each such line meets the unit sphere in exactly two points, which are opposite each other, and a third way of defining the real projective plane is to define opposite points inthe unit sphere to be equivalent and to take the quotient [I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of the unit sphere by this equivalence relation tive plane is to start with the usual Euclidean plane and[I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar).

With an appropriate topology, this defines the projective plane as a compact if ic at i on [III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) of the Euclidean plane. Taking the third definition, a line in the projective plane is defined to be a great circle with its oppo-site points identified. It is then not hard to see that any two lines meet in exactly one point (since any two great circles meet in exactly two opposite points)and that any two points are contained in exactly one line. This property can be used to define much more abstract generalizations of the notion of a projective plane.

III.73 Quadratic Forms Ben Green A quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in some finite set of unknown sx , x , . . . , x: an example isthe coefficients 1, q(x1-, x3, and 4 are integers, but the idea2, x3) = (x2)1 - 3 x1 (x2)1 + 42 (x2)3. Here, n generalizes straightforward ly from Z to any ring R. Since linear functions are undeniably important and 2 is the next positive integer after 1, one might expect quadratic forms to be important as well, and indeed they are, in many different branches of mathematics, including linear algebra itself.
Here are two theorems about quadratic forms. 268 Theorem 1. Ifx, y, and z are three points in Rd, then the distances between them satisfy the triangle inequality|x - z| ⩽ |x - y| + |y - z|.

Theorem 2.of two squares if and only if it leaves remainder An odd primep can be written as the sum1 on division by 4. thing to do with quadratic forms. The reason is that the square of the It is not at first sight clear why theorem 1 has any-Euclidean distance|x| = (x2)1 + · · · + (x2)d

The inner product satisfies the relations (i)$x$, x ⩾ 0 for all x \in Rd, with equality if and only (iii)(ii) ifxxλ, xx, yy,=\in y+0. = Rzd = . xx, λ, yy +  = xλ, zx, yfor allfor allx, yλ, z\in \in  RRdand. (iv)$x$, y = y, x for all x, y \in Rd. More generally, any function these relations is called an inner product.
The triangleφ(x, y)that satisfies inequality is a consequence of arguably the most impor-tant inequality in mathematics, the cauchy–schwarz inequality [V.19](/part-05/inequalities)

|x, y| ⩽ |x| |y|.

Not all quadratic forms on Rd come from inner prod- ucts, but they do all come from symmetric bilinear forms$g$: Rd . imes  Rd \to  R. These are functions of two variables that satisfy all the axioms of an inner prod-uct except possibly (i), the positivity criterion. Given a quadratic form$q(x) = g(x$, x), one may recover g using the polarization identity g(x$, y) = {}^{12}(q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y))$.
This correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms works just as well when R is replaced by any field serious technical issues whenk, except that there are somek has characteristic two (due to the presence of the fraction 12 in the above formula). In linear algebra one often forms by first discussing symmetric bilinear forms. The defines quadratic

advantage of this more abstract approach over the con-crete definition we gave at the beginning is that it is not necessary to specify a basis for Rd . ratic form can be made to look particularly pleasant: we may always choose a basis in such a way that If one makes a good choice of basis, then the quadq(x) = (x2)1 + · · · + (x2)s - (xs()2)+1 − · · · − (xt)2 for somes and t satisfying 0 ⩽ s ⩽ t ⩽ d.

Forms that are ple, the formx2 + y2 + z2 - t2 is used to define minkowski space special relativity. [I.3 §6.8](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), which plays a key role in ber theory, beginning with two very famous theorems about quadratic forms over the integers We turn now to examples of quadratic forms in num-Z. The first is theorem 2, mentioned at the start of the article.
It isdue to fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665). There are many related results for other binary quadratic forms such as$x^{2} + 3y^{2}$. In general, however, the question of whichx2 + 2 y2 and primes are represented byx2 + ny2 is extremely subtle and interesting, and leads one to[V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871). class field theory n In 1770 can be written as a sum of four squares.
In fact, the lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) showed that every number number of such representations ofthe formula$n$, r4(n), is given byr4(n) =d | n d.4 d

This formula can be explained using the theory ofular forms [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms), one of the most important topicsmodin number theory. Indeed, the generating series

No explicit bounds are known on how largex , x , and x need to be. 1 2 3 III.74 Quantum Computation A quantum computer is a theoretical device that makes use of the phenomenon of “superposition” in quantum mechanics to carry out certain computations in a way that is fundamentally different from any known classi-cal methods, and in a few important cases remarkably efficient.
In classical physics, if there is some property that a particle could have, then either it has it or it does not. But according to quantum mechanics, it can exist in a sort of indeterminate state that is a linear com-bination of several states, in some of which it might have the property in question and in others not. the coefficients in this linear combination are called probability amplitudes: the modulus squared of the coefficient associated with a state tells you the probability of finding that the particle is in that state if you do a measurement.
Exactly what happens when you take a measurement is puzzling, and the subject of much debate among physicists and philosophers. Fortunately, however, one can understand quantum computation with out solving the measurement problem, as it is called: indeed, one

269

can get away with not understanding quantum mechan-ics at all. (Similarly, and for similar reasons, one could in principle do significant work in theoretical com-puter science with out having the slightest idea what a transistor is or how it works.)To understand quantum computation it is helpful to look at two other models of computation. The notion ofa classical computation is a mathematical distillation of what actually goes on inside your computer. The “state” of a computer at any one time is modeled by an string: that is, a sequence of 0 s and 1 s of length nn.
Let-bit us write bits that make it up. A “computation” is a sequence ofσ for a typical string and σ1, σ2, . . . , σn for the very simple operations performed on the initial string. For example, one operation might be to choose three numbersbitσ of the current statei, j, and k, all less thanσ to 1 ifn, and change theσ = σ = 1 andkth to 0 otherwise. What makes an operation such as this(ki)j “simple” is that it isσdepends on, and affects, just a bounded number of local in character: what it does to bits ofone).
The “state space” of a classical computer, in thisσ(in this case it depends on two bits and affects model, is the set\\{0, 1\\}n of all possible n-bit strings, which we shall denote by After a certain number of stages, we declare the com- Qn. putation to have finished. At this point we perform a simple sequence of “measurements” on the final state, which consist in looking at the bits of the string we have ended up with. If our problem is a “decision problem,”then we will typically organize the computation so that all we need to look at is a single bit:
if it is 0 then the answer is no and if it is 1 then the answer is yes. If the ideas of the last two paragraphs are unfamiliar to you, then you are strongly advised to read the first few sections of computational complexity [IV.20](/part - 04/computational - complexity) before continuing with this article. The next model we shall consider is probabilistic computation that at each stage we are allowed to toss a (possibly. This is just like classical computation except biased) coin and let the simple operation we perform depend on the out come of the toss.
For instance, we might again choose three numbers time proceed as follows: with probability i, j, and2 we per formk, but this the operation described earlier, and with probability1 we changeσ to 1 - σ. Remarkably, introducing3 randomness into algorithms can be extremely helpful.(Equally remarkably, there are strong theoretical rea-3 kksons for believing that all algorithms that use randomness can in fact be “derandomized.” See [IV.20 §7.1](/part - 04/computational - complexity) for details.) 270 tic computation to run for examine the result.
How should we model the current Suppose that we allow our randomized probabilis - k steps and that we do not state of the computer? We could use exactly the same definition as in the classical case—a state is ann-bit string—and simply say that the computation is in astate that we cannot know until we do a measurement. But the state of the computer is not a complete mystery: for eachpσ that the state isn-bit string σσ. In other words, it is better to there will be some probability think of the state of the computer as atribution [III.71](/part - 03/probability - distributions) on Q .
This probability distribution probability dis- will depend on the initial string, and therefore it can inn principle give us useful information about that string. Here is how to use a randomized computation to solve a decision problem. Let us write probability that a certain bit (with out loss of general - P (σ ) for the ity the first) is 1 at the end of the computation, when the initial string isto be at leasta for all stringsσ . Suppose we can arrange forσ for which the answer is P (σ ) yes, and at most some smaller numberσ for which the answer is no.
Let c be the average ofb for all strings a and b. Now run the computation m times for some large then when we have finished the first bit will have beenm. With very high probability, if the answer is yes 1 more than will have been 1 fewer thancm times, and if the answer is no then itcm times. So we can solve the decision problem, not with certainty, but at least with a negligibly small chance of error. The “state space” of a probabilistic computer consists of all possible probability distributions onor equivalently all possible functions p:$Q \to [0Q$,1 n],$\text{such that}σ\in Q)n pσ = 1$.
The state space of an quan-$tum$ Qn, but there are two differences. First, they can take computer also consists of functions defined on complex as well as real values. Second, ifis a state, then the requirement on the size ofλ:$Q^{n} \to \lambda\text{isC}$ that tor in theσ\in Qhilbert spacen |λ|2 = 1.

The scalars . ambda are the probability ampli-banach spac(e2)n [III.62](/part - 03/normed - spaces - and - banach - spaces) tudes mentioned earlier.
We shall explain what this means later.1 nσare the “basis states,” which are the functions that take the value 1 at one string and 0 every where else. It is Among the possible states of a quantum computer customary to use Dirac’s “bra” and “ket” notation for these, writing|σ if the string in question is σ. Other “pure states” are then linear combinations of these, and Dirac’s notation is again used. For instance, if n= 5,

III. Mathematical Concepts

then one fairly simple state that the computer could bein is|ψ = (1/. qrt{2})|01101 + (i/. qrt{2})|11001. To get from one state to another, we again apply “local” operations, but adapted to the new, hilbert space context. Suppose first that we have a basis state |σ . Again we look at a very small number of bits. If, for instance, we look at three bits, atare eight possibilities for the triple$i$, j, andτ = k(σ, then there, σ , σ ), which we could think of as the basis states in a much smaller state space: the space of all functions1\mu:2 Q3 \to C such thatτ\in Q |\muτ|2 = 1.
The obvious operations3 that take unit vectors to unit vectors in a complex Hilbert space are the unitary maps [III.50 §3.1](/part - 03/linear - operators - and - their - properties), and these are indeed what are used. Let us illustrate this with an example. Suppose that nble operation on these three bits would send= 5, and that i, j, and k are 1, 2, and 4. One possi-|000 to(|000 + i|111 )/. qrt{2} and |111 to (i|000 + |111 )/. qrt{2}, leaving all other three-bit sequences as they are.
Ifour initial basis state is|01000, then the first, second, and fourth bits are in the state|000, so the resulting state at the end of the operation would be$(|01000 + i|11110 )/\sqrt{2}$. does to a basis state, we have in fact explained whatit does in general, since the basis states form a basis Now that we have explained what a basic operation of the state space.
In other words, if you start with a linear combination (or superposition) of basis states, you apply the operation described above to each basis state and take the corresponding linear combination of the results. Thus, an elementary operation of quantum computation consists in acting on the state space by means of a very special sort of unitary map.
If the operation isonk bits (where k is typically very small indeed), then the matrix of this map will be a diagonal sum of 2 n-kcopies of the 2 k . imes  2^k unitary matrix used to manipu- late thosek bits (if the basis elements are ap propri- ately ordered). A quantum computation is a sequenceof these elementary operations. more mysterious. The basic idea is simple: we do a cer-tain number of elementary operations and then look at Measuring the result of a quantum computation is one of the bits of the resulting state.
But what does this mean, when the state is not a basis state but rather a superposition of such states? The answer is that whenwe “measure” ther th bit of the output, we are doing a probabilistic process that is some what different from the measurement of a probabilistic computation: if the output state isλ |σ , then the probability thatσ\in  Q)σn

But$Q^{n}$, which one this probability distribution is not telling us what is inthe computer: that is a basis state. Rather, it is describing our contrast, the state of a quantum computer knowledge about what is in the computer. By really is a unit vector in a 2 n-dimensional Hilbert space. So in a certain sense a huge amount of computation can goon in parallel:
this is what gives quantum computation its power. Although we cannot know much about the computation, since a single measurement causes it to “collapse,” we can hope to organize it so that different parts of it “interfere” with each other. This “interference” is related to the second main difference, which isthe fact that we deal with probability amplitudes rather than probabilities. Roughly speaking, a quantum com-putation can “split up” and “reassemble itself,” where as once a probabilistic computation splits up it stays split up.
Crucial to the reassembly process in a quantum computation isto give an extreme example, if you multiply a typi-cancelation of probability amplitudes: cal unitary matrix by its inverse, then there is a huge amount of cancelation to get all the off-diagonal entries of the resulting matrix to be zero. All this raises two obvious questions:
what are quantum computers good for, and can they actually be built?It turns out that a quantum computer can carry out classical and probabilistic computations, so the first question is asking whether they can do anything further.1 One might think so, since the state space is so much bigger than it is for a classical computation (it is2 n dimensional rather than merely n dimensional), and the reassembly process means that we can potentially afford to visit remote parts of the state space, where all coefficients might be of very similar (and small) mag-ni tudes, and come back again to a state
where a useful but it would take an absurdly long time to do so: quantum computers cannot calculate noncomputable functions, but they may be far more1. It is also possible to simulate a quantum computation classically, efficient at calculating some computable ones.

271

measurement can be made. However, the very vastnessof this space means that most states are completely inaccessible unless one is prepared to use a vast number of basic operations. Additionally, it is important that at the end of the computation the output should not be a “typical” state, since only very special states give rise to useful measurements. These arguments show that if a quantum computation is to be useful, then it will have to be very carefully (and cleverly) organized. However, there is a spectacular example of just such a computation:
Peter Shor’s use of a quantum computer to calculate fast fourier transforms [III.26](/part-03/the-fast-fourier-transform) extremely rapidly. The fast Fourier transform has a symmetry that allows the calculation to be split up and carried out “in parallel” (it might be better to say “in superposition”) ina way that is ideally suited to a quantum computer. A super-fast Fourier transform can then be used to solve (by classical methods) some famous com put a-tional problems, such as the discrete logarithm problem and the factorization of large integers.
The latter can then be used to break a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption method that lies at the heart of modern computer security. (See rap hy [VII.7 §5](/part-07/mathematics-and-cryptography) and computational number theory mathematics and cryptog[IV.3 §3](/part-04/computational-number-theory) for further discussion of these problems.)Can a machine be built that would actually be able to do this?
There are formidable problems to over come, arising from a phenomenon in quantum mechan-ics known as “decoherence,” which makes it very hard to stop a complicated state from “collapsing” to a sim-pler one that is no longer of use. Some progress has been made, but it is too early to say whether, or when, a quantum computer will be built that can factorize large numbers quickly. notion of a quantum computer are fascinating. Perhaps the most interesting one is very simple:

[IV.20 §4](/part-04/computational-complexity) problems? The majority opinion is that they can not, and indeed the statement that they cannot is becoming another of the many “plausible hypotheses” of complexity theory, but it would be good to have stronger reasons for believing in this statement, such as a proof subject to already-known plausible hypotheses in classical computation. III.75 Quantum Groups

Shahn Majid

There are at least three different paths that lead to the objects known today as quantum groups. They could be summarized briefly as quantum geometry, quantum symmetry, and self-duality. Any one of them would be a great reason to invent quantum groups and each of them had a role in the development of the modern theory.
1 Quantum Geometry One of the great discoveries in physics in the last cen-tury was that classical mechanics should be replaced by quantum mechanics, in which the space of possi-ble positions and moment a of a particle is replaced by the formulation of position and momentum as mutually noncommuting operators. This non commutativity under lies Heisenberg’s “uncertainty principle,” but it also suggests the need for a more general notion ofgeometry in which coordinates need not commute.
One approach to noncommutative geometry is discussed inapproach is to note that geometry really grew out ofoperator algebras [IV.15 §5](/part-04/operator-algebras). However, another examples such as spheres, tori, and so forth, which are lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory) or objects closely related to Lie groups. If one wants to “quantize” geometry, one should first think about how to generalize basic examples like this: in other words, one should try to define “quantum Lie groups” and associated “quantum” homogeneous spaces.
not so much in terms of their points but in terms of corresponding The first step is to consider geometrical structures algebras. For example, the group SL(C) is defined as the set of 2 numbers such thatαδ -βγ. imes  2 matrices= 1. We can think of this as(^α β^γ δ ) of complex a subset of C4, and indeed not just a subset but a ety with this variety is the set of polynomials in four vari-[III.95](/part-03/varieties). The natural class of functions associated variables (which are defined on C4) restricted to the variety. However, if two polynomials take equal values on the

In other words, we take the algebra of polynomials in four variablesa, b, c, andderated by the polynomial and quotient[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) by thead - bc ideal - 1. (This con struc-[III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) gen tion is discussed in detail in[IV.5 §3.2](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry).)

There is a2(C) equivalently in terms of the algebra counit map: C[SL ] \to k, which corresponds to the group identity, and an$S$: C2[SL ] \to  C[SL ], which corresponds to the group2 antipode map in version.

Of course, if H is (since multiplying two polynomials is commutative), soif we can find a noncommutative Hopf algebra, then we have obtained a strict generalization of the notion ofa group. The great discovery of the past two decades is that there are indeed many natural noncommutative examples. For example, the quantum group C[SL ]is defined as the free associative noncommutativeq2 algebra on symbols a, b, c, and d modulo the relationsba = qab, bc = cb, ca = qac, dc = qcd, db = qbd, da = ad + (q - q-1)bc, ad - q-1 bc = 1.
This forms a Hopf algebra with formula as it is for C[SL ] and with suitable mapsΔ given by the same and Sobtains. Here q C[is a nonzero element of SL ]. This example generalizes to canonical2 C, and as q \to  1 one examples Much of group theory and Lie group theory can be Cq[G]2 for all complex simple Lie groups G. generalized to quantum groups. For example, Haar inte-gration is a linear map : H \to k that is translation invariant in a certain sense that involvesΔ.
If it exists, it is unique up to a scalar multiple, and it does indeed exist in most cases of interest, including all finite dimensional Hopf algebras. Likewise, the notion of a complex of differential forms [III.16](/part-03/dierential-forms-and-integration)(Ω, d) makes

sense over any algebra structure. Here,Ω = HΩas a proxy for a different i a ln is required to be an asso- cia tive algebra generated bydoes not assume that it is graded-commutative as inn Ω0 = H and Ω1, but one the classical case. When ask thatΩ is translation invariant, again in a certain H is a Hopf algebra one can sense that involves the coproductΔ. In this case bothΩ(or graded) quantum groups.
The axioms of a (graded)and its cohomology[IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology) as a complex are super Hopf algebra were originally introduced by Heinz Hopfin 1947 precisely to express the structure of the cohomology ring of a group, so this result brings us back full circle to the origins of the subject. For most quantum groups, including all the minimal complex(Ω, d). Thus, a “quantum group” is Cq[G], one has a natural not merely a Hopf algebra but has additional structure analogous to that of a Lie group.
There are many other quantum groups that are not related toof the theory to finite groups. Ifq-deformations. There are also applications Gis a finite group, one has a corresponding algebra tions on G with pointwise product and a coproductk(G) of all func-(. elta f )(g, h) = f (gh) for f \in  k(G) and g, h \in  G. Here we identify k(G) ⊗k(G) and k(G . imes G), which makes Δf into a function of two variables, and one may check even more simply that this is a Hopf algebra.
There can never be an interesting classical differential struc-ture on a finite set, but if we use the methods developed for quantum groups, then we have one or more translation-invariant complexes$(Ω^{1}$, d)on any finite group. Applying further parts of the theory of quan-tum group differential geometry, one finds, for example, that the alternating group while the symmetric group$S^{3}\text{Anaturally has constant}^{4}$is naturally Ricci-flat, curvature [III.13](/part-03/curvature), much like a 3-sphere.
2 Quantum Symmetry Symmetry in mathematics is usually expressed as the action of a group or Lie algebra of finite or infinitesimal transformations of some structure. If you have a collection of transformations that is closed under inver-sion and composition, then you necessarily have an ordinary group. So how might one generalize this? The answer is that one begins by observing that a group G can act on several objects at the same time. If a group acts on two objects X and Y, then it also acts on their direct product$X \times Y$, with g(x, y) = (gx, gy).
Here we are making implicit use of a diagonal or “duplica-tion” map. elta: G \to  G . imes  G, which duplicates a group

element so that one copy can act on the first object and the other on the second object. In order to generalize this it once again pays to replace the notion of a group group algebra G by that of an algebra. This time we use thek G, which is the set of all formal linear combinations and the. ambda are scalars from the fieldi . ambda igi, where the gi are elements ofk. The elements Gi of G(considered as particularly simple linear combina- tions of this kind) form a basis ofthem as we would in G itself.
One then extends thisk G and we multiply definition to products of more general linear combi-nations in the obvious way. We also extend. elta linearly fromk G to. elta k Gg =⊗gk G⊗ . Together with some associated mapsg on the basis elements to a map from this is a completely different use of the coproduct from the one in the previous section, since the group prod-and S, this makes k G into a Hopf algebra. Note that uct has already gone into the algebra. One has a similar story for the “enveloping algebra” U(g) associated with any Lie algebra g;
this is generated by a basis of g with certain relations and becomes a Hopf algebra with the coproduct. eltaξ = ξ ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ξ“sharing out” an element ξ \in  g for the purposes of acting on a tensor product of objects on which g acts. “quantum symmetry” means an algebra with further structure Extrapolating from these two examples, a general. elta that allows one to form a ten-H equipped sor product the algebra in an associative manner. An element V ⊗ W of any two representations Vh, W\in  of H acts asacts onh(vv \in ⊗w)V and another part on= (. elta h)(v ⊗w), where one part ofw \in  W .
This isΔh a second route to the Hopf algebra axioms we gave inthe previous section. Note that, in the examples just given,Δ has had a symmetric output. As a consequence, if representations of a group or Lie algebra, then V and VW⊗are W and takes Wv⊗⊗Vw are isomorphic via the obvious map thatto w ⊗ v . In general, however, V ⊗ W and W ⊗V may be unrelated, so it is now the tensor product that is being made noncommutative. In nice examples itmay be the case that V ⊗W W ⊗V , but not necessarily by the obvious map.
Instead, there may be a nontriv-ial isomorphism for every pair V , W , which may nev- er the less obey some reasonable conditions. This hap-pens for a large class of examples, denoted by U(g) and associated with all complex simple Lie algebras. For these examples, the isomorphism obeys the braid$q$ or Yang–Baxter relations among any three representations (seetum groups lead to braid groups knot and[III.4](/part-03/braid-groups)). As a result, these quan-3-manifold invariants

The paramete(r2)2 q can usefully be regarded here as a formal variable, and these examples can be thought of as some kind of deformation of the classical enveloping algebras U(g). They arose originally in work of Drin- feld and of Jimbo in the theory of quantum integrable systems.
3 Self-duality A third point of view is that Hopf algebras are the next simplest category [III.8](/part-03/categories) after Abelian groups of structures that admit a immediately obvious, but the axioms (i)–(iii) in the def-fourier transform [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform). It is not inition we gave earlier have a certain symmetry. Onecan write out the requirement (i) of a unital algebra$H$ in terms of linear maps$m$:$H ⊗ H \to k and η$:$k \to H$ (hereof 1$\in ηk$ specifies the identity element of) that have to obey some straightforward com-H as the image mutative diagrams.
If you reverse all the arrows in these diagrams, then you have the axioms displayed in (ii), obtaining what could be called a “coalgebra.” the requirement that the coalgebra structuresΔ and are algebra maps is given by a collection of diagrams thatis invariant under arrow reversal. Finally, the axioms in (iii), as commutative diagrams, are invariant under arrow reversal in the above sense. cial property of being symmetric under arrow rever-sal.

Majid, S. 2002.ematical Society Lecture Notes, volume 292. Cambridge: A Quantum Groups Primer. London Math Cambridge University Press. III.76 Quaternions, Octonions, and Normed Division Algebras Mathematics took a leap forward in sophistication with the introduction of the complex numbers [I.3 §1.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). To define these, one suspends one’s disbelief, introduces anew number i, and declares that i2= −1. A typical com- plex number is of the forma + ib, and the arithmetic of complex numbers is easy to deduce from the normal rules of arithmetic for real numbers.
For example, to calculate the product of 1 + 2 i and 2 + i one simply expands some brackets:$(1 + 2 i)(2 + i) = 2 + 5 i + 2 i2 = 5 i$, the last equality following from the fact that i2= −1. One of the great advantages of the complex numbers is that, if complex roots are allowed, every polynomial can be factorized into linear factors: this is the famous fundamental theorem of algebra [V.13](/part - 05/the - fundamental - theorem - of - algebra). Another way to define a complex number is to say that it is a pair of real numbers. That is, instead of writ - inga + ib one writes simply (a, b).
To add two complex numbers is simple, and exactly what one does when adding two vectors:(a$, b)+(c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$. How- ever, it is less obvious how to multiply: the product of(a, b) and (c, d) is (ac - bd, ad + bc), which seems an odd definition unless one goes back to thinking of(a, b) and (c, d) as a + ib and c + id.
tion to the fact that the complex numbers are formed out of the two-dimensional Nevertheless, the second definition draws our atten-vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) R2 with a carefully chosen definition of multiplication. This immediately raises a question: could we do the same for higher-dimensional spaces? we have not been clear about what “the same” means. To make it precise, we must ask what properties this As it stands, this question is not wholly precise, since multiplication should have.
So let us return to R2 and think about why it would be a bad idea to define the product of(a, b) and (c, d) in a simple-minded way as276(ac, bd)uct of a +. Of course, part of the reason is that the prod-ib and c + id is not ac + ibd, but why should we not also be interested in other ways of multiplying vectors in R2? it allows bers that multiply together to give zero. For example, The trouble with this alternative definition is that zero divisors, that is, pairs of nonzero numit gives us(1,0)(0, 1) = (0,0).
If we have zero divi - sors, then we cannot have multiplicative inverses, since if every nonzero number in a number system has a multiplicative inverse, and ify = x - 1 xy = x - 10 = 0. And if we do not have multi - xy = 0, then either x = 0 or plicative inverses, then we cannot define a useful notion of division. Let us return then to the usual definition of the complex numbers and try to think how we can go beyond it. One way we might try to “do the same” as we did before is to do to the complex numbers what we did to the real numbers.
That is, why not define a “super - complex”number to be an ordered pair(z, w) of complex num - bers? Since we still want to have a vector space, we will continue to define the sum of(z, w) and (u, v) to be(z + u, w + v), but we need to think about the best way of defining their product. An obvious guess is to use precisely the expression that worked before, namely (zuof (1-, iwv, zv) and (1+, wu)-i) works out to be. But if we do that, then the product(1 + i2, i - i) = (0,0), so we have zero divisors. modulus sur es the length of the vector This example came from the following thought.

More over, if a2 + b2 = 0 it does not follow that came from taking a = 1 anda = bb==0. The example abovei and multiplying the number(1, i)by its “conjugate”(1,-i). modulus of a pair are complex numbers.
The number There is, nevertheless, a natural way to define the(z, w) that works even when|z|2 + |w|2 zisandguar-w anteed to be nonnegative, so we can take its square root. More over, ifz = a + ib and w = c + id, then we will obtain the number(a2 + b2 + c2 + d2()1()/){2}, which is the length of the vector This observation leads to another: the complex con-(a, b, c, d). jugate of a real number is the number itself, so, if we want to “use the same formula” for the complex num-bers as we used for the reals, we are free to introduce

III. Mathematical Concepts

complex conjugates into that formula. Before we try todo that, let us think about what we might mean by the “conjugate” of a pair like the complex number(z, w)z, so its conjugate should be. We expect (z, 0) to behave(ofz, ̄(z, w)0). Similarly, if should bez and(z, -ww)are real, then the conjugate. This leaves us with two reasonable possibilities for a general pair(z, ̄-w) ̄ or(z, ̄-w). Let us consider the second of these.(z, w): either which we are defining as We would like the product of(z, ̄-w)(z, w), to beand its conjugate$,(|z|2 + |w|2, 0)$.
We want to achieve this by introducing complex conju-gates into the formula

(z$, w)(u, v) = (zu - wv, zv + wu)$.

An obvious way of getting the result we want is to take (z, w)(u, v) = (zu - wv, ̄$zv$ ̄$+ wu)$, and this modified formula, it turns out, defines an associative binary operation(z, w). If you try the other definition of conjugate, you[I.2 §2.4](/part - 01/language - and - grammar) on the set of pairs will find that you end up with zero divisors.
(A first indication of trouble is that, under the other definition, the pair We have just defined the(0, i) is its own conjugate.)quaternions, a set H of “numbers” that form a four-dimensional real vector space, or alternatively a two-dimensional complex vector space. (The letter “H” is in honor of William Rowan Hamilton, their discoverer. Seethe story of how the discovery was made.) But why hamilton [VI.37](/part - 06/william - rowan - hamilton - 18051865) for should we have wished to do that?
This question becomes particularly pressing when we notice that thenotion of multiplication that we have defined is not commutative. For example,(i$,0)(0, 1) = (0, -i)$. (0$, 1)(i,0) = (0, i)$, while To answer it, let us take a step back and think about the complex numbers again. The most obvious justifi-cation for introducing those is that one can use them to solve all polynomial equations, but that is by no means the only justification. In particular, complex numbers have an important geometrical interpretation, as rotations and enlargements.
This connection becomes par-ticular ly clear if we choose yet another way of writing the complex number pl ic at i on by the complex number a+ib, as the matrix a +ib can be thought(a b a-b ). Multi- of as a linear map [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) on the plane R2, and this is the matrix of that linear map. For example, the com-plex number i corresponds to the matrix(0 -1), which is the matrix of a counter clockwise rotation through1π about the origin, and this rotation is exactly what1 0 multiplying by i does to the complex plane.2 III.76.
Quaternions, Octonions, and Normed Division Algebras from pr et at i on as linear maps from If complex numbers can be thought of as linear maps R2 to R2, then quaternions should have an inter - C2 to C2. And indeed they do. Let us associate with the pair(z w). Now let us consider the product of two such(z, w) the matrix matrices:$- {}^{wz} - \text{zw wz}$ ̄ ̄$\sum - \text{uv vu}$ ̄ ̄$= -zuzv$ ̄--w$\bar{v}wu z \bar{z}vu$ ̄ ̄$+- ww$ ̄$uv$ ̄ ̄.
This product is precisely the matrix associated with the pair(zu - wv, z$\bar{v}$+ wu) ̄ , which is the quaternionic product ofate corollary, we have a proof of a fact mentioned(z, w) and (u, v)! As an i mm ed i earlier: that quaternionic multiplication is associative. Why? Because matrix multiplication is associative. (And that associative:

This proves that the mod-ulus of the product of two quaternions is the product of their moduli (since the determinant of a product is the product of determinants).
Notice also that the adjoint of the matrix (that is, the complex conjugate of the transpose matrix) is$( {}^{z - w})$, which is the matrix asso- ciated with the conjugate pair that if$|z|^{2} + |w|^{2} = 1$, thenw z ( ̄z, -w). Finally, notice - zw w$\bar{z}$. um w. ar{z}-z. ar{w} = 10 01 , which tells us that the matrix is Conversely, any unitary 2 . imes 2 matrix with determinant 1 unitary[III.50 §3.1](/part - 03/linear - operators - and - their - properties). can easily be shown to have the form fore, the unit quaternions (that is, the quaternions(-z w w z^ ̄^ ̄ ).
There- of modulus 1) have a geometrical interpretation: they correspond to the “rotations” of C2 (that is, the unitary maps of determinant 1), just as the unit complex numbers correspond to the rotations of R2. The group of unitary transformations of C2 of determinant 1 is an important the special unitary group SUlie group(2). Another important Lie[III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory) called group is the group SO(3)$, \text{of rotations of} R^{3}$. Surpris- ingly, the unit quaternions can be used to describe this group as well.
To see this, it is convenient to present the quaternions in another, more conventional, way. Quaternions, as they are usually introduced, are a system of numbers where we introduce not just one square root of-1 but three, called i, j, and k (together with their negatives). Once one knows that ik2= −1, and also that ij = k, jk = i, and ki = j, one has2 = j2 = 277 all the information one needs to multiply two quater - nions. For example, ji$= jjk = −k$.
A typical quaternion takes the form pair of complex numbers a + ib + jc + k(ad, which corresponds to the + ic, b + id) in our previ- ous way of thinking about quaternions. Now if we want, we can think of this quaternion as a pair(a, v), wherea is a real number and v is the vector (b, c, d) in R3. The product of(ab - v · w, aw(a,+ bvv)+andv ∧(b, w)w, where) then works out to bev · w and v ∧ w are the scalar and vector products of Ifq = (a, u) is a quaternion of modulus 1, thenv and w. a2 + u2 = 1, so we can write q in the form (. os θ, v . in θ) witha counter clockwise rotationv a unit vector.
This quaternion corresponds to R about an axis in direc- tion one might at first expect, and neither is the way thev through an angle of 2θ. This angle is not what correspondence works. Ifrepresent it as the quaternionw is another vector, we can(0, w). We would now like a neat expression for the quaternion turns out that(0$, Rw) = q(0, w)q^{*}$, where(0 q, R* wis the); it conjugate(. os  θ, -v . in  θ) of q, which is also its multi- plicative inverse, astion R, you do not multiply byq has modulus 1. So to do the rota-q but rather you con- jugate by$q$.
(This is a different meaning of the word “conjugate,” referring to multiplying on one side byq and on the other side by q-1.) Now if q and q are quaternions corresponding to rotations respectively, then$(R1)1 and (R2)2$, q2 q1(0, w)q^*1 q^*2 = q2 q1(0, w)(q2 q1)^*, from which it follows thatq2 q1 corresponds to the rota- tion corresponds to composition of rotations.$R^{2}R^{1}$. This tells us that quaternionic multiplication The unit quaternions form a group, as we have already seen—it is Su shown that SU(2) is the same as the group SO(2).
It might appear that we have(3) of rotations of because for each rotation of R3. However, we have not quite done this, R3 there are two unit quaternions that give rise to it. The reason is simple: a counter clockwise rotation throughθ about a vectorv-θis the same as a counter clockwise rotation through about -v. In other words, if q is a unit quaternion, thenq and -q give rise to the same rotation of R3. So Suc over(2)of SOis not isomorphic to SO(3). This fact has important ramifications in(3); rather, it is a double mathematics and physics.
In particular, it lies behind the notion of the “spin” of an elementary particle. Let us return to the question we were considering earlier: for which vectors in R$n$? We now know that we can do it forn is there a good way of multiplyingn = 1, 278 2$, or 4. When$ n =4 we had to sacrifice commutativity, but we were amply rewarded for this, since quaternion multiplication gives a very concise way of representing the important groups SUare not commutative, so it was essential to our suc-(2) and SO(3). These groups cess that quaternion multiplication should also not be commutative.
that led to the quaternions. That is, we can consider pairs One obvious thing we can do is continue the process(q, r ) of quaternions, and multiply these pairs together using the formula (q$, r )(s, t) = (qs - r^{*}t, q^{*}t + r s)$. Since the conjugateq* of a quaternion q is the ana- logue of the complex conjugat. ar{e}z, this is basically the same formula that we used forz of a complex number multiplication of pairs of complex numbers—that is, for quaternions. However, we need to be careful:
multiplication of quaternions is not commutative, so there are in fact many formulas we could write down that would be “basically the same” as the earlier one. Why choose the above one, rather than, say, replacing$q^{*}t \text{by tq}^{*}$? to zero divisors. For example,(0 It turns out that the formula suggested above leads,0). However, the modified formula(j, i)(l, k) works out to be(q, r )(s, t) = (qs - tr*, q*t + sr ), which one can discover fairly quickly if one bears inmind that one would like(q$, r )(q^{*}$,-r ) to work out$as$(|q|2 + |r |2, 0), does produce a useful number sys- tem.
It is denoted O and its elements are called the octonions tu nate ly, multiplication of octonions is not even asso-(or some times the Cayley numbers). Un for cia tive, but it does have two very good properties: every nonzero octonion has a multiplicative inverse, and two nonzero octonions never multiply together togive zero. (Because octonion multiplication is not associative, these two properties are no longer obviously equivalent.
However, any subalgebra of the octonions generated by two elements is associative, and this is enough to prove the equivalence.)So now we have number systems when$n$ = 1, 2, 4, or

8. It turns out that these are the good notions of multiplication. Of course, “good” has only dimensions with a technical meaning here: matrix multiplication, which is associative but gives zero divisors, is for many purposes “better” than octonion multiplication, which hasno zero divisors but is not associative. So let us finish by seeing more precisely what it is that is special about dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8.

For a quaternion or octonion wherex* is the conjugate ofx, it is defined to be$x$(a definition that works$\sqrt{x}^{*}x$, for real and complex numbers as well). If we write for the norm ofx, then the norms constructed havex the property thatxy = x. um y for every x and y. This property is extremely useful:
for example, it tells us that the elements of norm 1 are closed under multiplication, a fact that we used many times when discussing the geometric importance of complex numbers and quaternions. 8 from all other dimensions is that these are the only dimensions for which one can define a norm The feature that distinguishes dimensions 1, 2, 4, and· and a notion of multiplication with the following properties. (i) There is a multiplicative identity: that is, a num - ber 1 such that 1 x = x1 = x for every x.
(ii) Multiplication is bilinear, meaning thatx(y +z) =xy+xz for every x, y , and z, and x(ay) = a(xy) whenever multiplication on the right.a is a real number, and similarly for (iii) For anyx and y, xy = x. um y (and therefore there are no zero divisors). A normed division algebra is a vector space Rn together with a norm and a method of multiplying vectors that satisfy the above properties. So normed division algebras exist only in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Further-more, even in these dimensions, R, C, H, and O are the only examples. There are various ways to prove this fact, which is known asof one of them. The idea is to prove that if a normed Hurwitz’s theorem. Here is a very brief sketch division algebra then either it is that example, or it contains the next one A contains one of the above examples, in the sequence. So either A contains the algebra produced by doing to A is one of R, C, H, and O the pro-O or cess we used to construct H from C and O from H, a process known as the Cayley–Dickson construction.
However, if one applies the Cayley–Dickson construction to O, one obtains an algebra with zero divisors. imagine, for the sake of example, thatas a proper subalgebra. It turns out that the norm on To see how such an argument might work, let us A contains Oa derived from an inner product. (Roughly speaking, this must be a euclidean norm[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis)—that is, a norm is because multiplication by an element of norm 1 does not change the norm, which gives A so many symme- tries that the norm on A has to be the most symmetric

Then A we can define a conjugation operation oning 1^* to be 1 and x^* to be -x when x is imaginary, A by tak- and extending linearly. This operation can be shown to have all the properties one would like. In particular, aa* = a*a = a2 for every element a of A. Let us choose a norm-1 element ofof O and call it i. Then i* = −A that is orthogonal to alli, so 1 = i*i = −i2, so$i2$= −1. Now take the algebra generated by i and the copy of O that lies in A.

Terence Tao

Ricci flow is a technique that allows one to take an arbi-trary riemannian manifold [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and smooth out the geometry of that manifold to make it look more symmetric. It has proven to be a very useful tool in understanding the topology of such manifolds. of any dimension, but for the sake of exposition werestrict ourselves here to two-dimensional manifolds Ricci flow can be defined for Riemannian manifolds (i.e., surfaces) as they are easy to visualize.
From our everyday experience with three-dimensional space R3, we are familiar with many surfaces, such as spheres, cylinders, planes, tori (the shape of the surface of a doughnut), and so forth. This is an think about surfaces: as subsets of a larger extrinsic ambient way to spaceean space. On the other hand, one can think about, which in this case is three-dimensional euclid surfaces in a more abstract side ring how the points in the surface stand in rela-intrinsic manner: by con tion to each other, but not in relation to any external space.
(For instance, the Klein bottle makes perfect sense as a surface from an intrinsic viewpoint, but cannot be viewed extrinsically in three-dimensional Euclid-ean space R3, although it can be viewed extrinsically in four-dimensional Euclidean space R4.) It turns out that the two viewpoints are mostly equivalent to each other, but it will be more convenient here to adopt the intrinsic perspective. A good example of a surface is the surface of Earth. Extrinsically, this is a subset of a three-dimensional space R3.
But we can also view this surface two dimensionally by using anthat describe various regions of this surface by identi-atlas: a collection of maps or charts fying them with a subset of a two-dimensional plane. As long as we have enough charts to cover the original surface, this atlas is sufficient to describe the sur-face. This way of thinking of a surface is not completely intrinsic, because there is more than one atlas that one could associate with this surface, and they may differ in various minor ways. For instance, in one atlas the city

280

of Los Angeles might be on the boundary of one of the charts, where as in another atlas it might be in the interior of every chart that it appears in. However, there are many facts one can deduce from an atlas that do not depend on the choice of atlas; for instance, using any accurate atlas of Earth one can see that it is impossible to travel from Los Angeles to Sydney with out crossing at least one ocean. If a fact regarding a surface does not depend on which atlas one uses, we say that itis intrinsic or coordinate-independent.
It will turn out that Ricci flow is an intrinsic flow on surfaces;
it canbe defined with out any knowledge of charts or of some external space. cept of a surface, or two-dimensional manifold. But todescribe Ricci flow we need the more sophisticated con-We have informally described the mathematical concept of amannian manifold). This is a surface Riemannian surface (or two-dimensional Rie-M with an addi- tional (intrinsic) object, aspecifies the distanc ed(x, y)Riemannian metric between any two poin tsg, whichxthe angle, yon the surface. This metric allows one to define∠γ , γ that any two curves γ , γ on the sur- face make where they intersect;
for instance, the Earth’s1 2 1 2 equator intersects any longitude at right angles. And itcan also be used to define the area|A| of any given set Anumber of properties that these concepts of distance, on the surface (e.g., the area of Australia). There are a angle, and area have to satisfy, but the most important property can be stated informally as follows: geometry of a Riemannian surface has to be very close the to the geometry of the Euclidean plane at small length scales. To give an example of what the above statement means, take any point any positive radiu sr .
Because the Riemannian metricx in the surface M, and pickg B(x, r )specifies a notion of distance, we can define theof radiu sr centered at x to be the set of all disk point sy whose distance d(x, y) to x is less than r . Because the Riemannian metricarea, we can then discuss the area of this dis kg defines a notion of B(x, r ). In the Euclidean plane, this area would of course be$πr^{2}$. In a Riemannian surface, this need not be the case:
for instance, the total area of the surface of Earth (and hence of all disks within this surface) is finite, eventhoughπr2 can be arbitrarily large as rgoes to infinity. However, we do require that, when are a of the disk B(x, r ) becomes increasingly close tor is very small, theπrthe area and2; more precisely, we require that the ratio betweenπr2 converges to 1 in the limit as r tends to 0.

III. Mathematical Concepts

In some cases, such as on the sphere, the area This brings us to the notion of scalar curvature|B(x, r )R(x)|. of a small disk than$πr^{2}$; when this is the case, we say that the sur-B(x, r ) is actually a little bit smaller face has cases, such as on a saddle, the area positive scalar curvature at|B(x, r )x. In some other| of a small disk B(x, r ) is a bit larger than πr2; then we say that the surface has cases again, such as on a cylinder, the area negative scalar curvature atx. In other|B(x, r )| of a small diskto$πr^{2}$;
in this case we say the surface has B(x, r ) is equal (or very nearly equal)vanishing scalar curvature“curved” when viewed extrinsically as a subset of three-atx. (This is despite the cylinder being dimensional space.) Note that on a complicated surface it is perfectly possible to have positive scalar curvature at some points of the surface and negative or vanishing scalar curvature at other points. The scalar curva-ture R(x) at any given point xcan be defined more precisely by the formula R(x) =r. im \to0 πr2πr− |4 B(x, r )/24 |.
(For surfaces in an external space, this intrinsic concept of scalar curvature is almost identical to the extrinsic concept of Gauss curvature, which we will not discuss here.) One can refine this notion to that of Ricci curvature A(x, r , θ, v)Ric(x)(v, v)inside a small disk. Consider now an angular sector B(x, r ) of small angu- lar apertureθ (measured in radians) about some direc- tion well-defined, basically because the Riemannian met ricv (a unit vector) emanating from x.
This sector is gives us the appropriate notions of distance and angle. In Euclidean space, the area|A(x, r , θ, v)| of this sec- tor ismay be slightly less (respectively, slightly more) than12θr^2. But on a surface, the area |A(x, r , θ, v)|$12$θr^2. In these cases we say that the surface has posi- tive (respectively, negative) Ricci curvature at direct io nv. More precisely, we have x in the$Ric$(x)(v, v) = . im^r\to^0 . im^θ\to^0^1^2θr^2 − |θr A(x, r , θ, v)^4/24 |. plicated notion of curvature is in fact equal to half the scalar curvature:
Ric Now it turns out that for surfaces, this more com-(x)(v$, v) = {}^{1} R(x)$. In partic- ular, the directionv plays no role in Ricci curvature2 in two dimensions. However, it is possible to extend all of the above concepts to other dimensions. (For instance, to define scalar and Ricci curvature for three dimensional manifolds, one would use balls and solid

sectors instead of disks and angular sectors, as well as making other necessary adjustments, such as replacing the expression turns out that the Ricci curvature is more complicatedπr2 wit(h4)3πr3.) In higher dimensions it than the scalar curvature. For instance, in three dimen-sions it is possible for a pointx to have positive Ricci curvature in one direction but negative Ricci curvature in another;
intuitively, this means that narrow sectors in the former direction “curve inward,” where as narrow sectors in the latter direction “curve outward.” Now we can describe Ricci flow informally as the process of Ricci curvature, and stretching the metric contract in gg in directions of negative the metric in directions of positive Ricci curvature. The stronger the curvature, the faster the stretching or contracting of the metric. The concepts of stretching and contracting will not be defined formally here, but they increase or decrease the distance between points along these directions.
By changing the notion of distance, one also affects the notions of angle and volume (though it turns out that Ricci flow in two dimensions is conformal, which means that the notion of angle remains unaffected by the flow; this fact is closely related to the previously mentioned fact that in two dimensions the Ricci curvature is the same in all directions). Ricci flow can be described succinctly and precisely by the equation d

$g = −2 Ric$,$d$ t

although we will not define here exactly what it means to differentiate the metricg with respect to the time variable the Ricci curvature multiplied byt, or what it means for that derivative to equal-2. In principle, one could perform Ricci flow on a manifold for as long a period of time as one wished. In prac-tice, however, it is possible (especially in the presence of positive curvature) for the Ricci flow to cause a man-ifold to develop singularities: points where it ceases to look like a manifold, and where the geometry may stop resembling Euclidean geometry even at very small scales.
For example, if one starts with a perfectly round sphere and performs Ricci flow, what happens is that the sphere contracts at a steady rate until it becomes a point, which is no longer a two-dimensional mani-fold. In three dimensions, more complicated singularities are possible: for instance, one can have a neck pinch shrinks under Ricci flow, until at one or more places, in which a cylinder-like “neck” of the manifold along the neck, the cylinder has tapered down to apoint. The types of possible singularity formations for

281

three-dimensional Ricci flow were only classified completely in a recent and very important paper of Grigori Perelman. Some years ago, Richard Hamilton made the fundamental observation that Ricci flow is an excellent tool for simplifying the structure of a manifold: generally speaking, it compresses all the positive-curvature parts of the manifold into nothingness, while expanding the negative-curvature parts of the manifold until they become very homogeneous, in the sense that the manifold begins to look much the same no matter which vantage point one selects inside it.
Indeed, the flow seems to separate the manifold into extremely symmetric components. For instance, in two dimensions the Ricci flow always ends up endowing the manifold with a metric of constant curvature, which could be positive(as in the sphere), zero (as in the cylinder), or negative (as incurvature metric can always be found is known as hyperbolic space); the fact that such a constant the mental importance in the theory of surfaces.
In higher uniformization theorem [V.34](/part-05/the-uniformization-theorem) and is of funda dimensions, the Ricci flow can develop singularities before perfect symmetry is attained, but it turns out that it is possible to perform “surgeries” (seeential topology [[IV.7 §§2.3, 2.4]](/part-04/di-erential-topology)) on the singularities differ that develop this way, so that the manifold becomes smooth again and one can restart the Ricci flow process. (The surgery may, however, change the topologyof the manifold:
for instance, it can convert a connected manifold into two disconnected pieces.) In three dimen-sions it has recently been shown by Perelman that Ricci flow, when augmented by surgery to remove the sin-gularities, does indeed convert an arbitrary manifold (obeying some mild assumptions) into a finite union of some very symmetric and explicitly describable pieces; the precise statement of this conclusion was known as the sequence of this conjecture, which is now a rigorous geometrization conjecture of Thurston.
One con theorem proved by Perelman, is thejecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture): any compact three-dimensional man-poincaré con if old that isloop on the manifold can be contracted smoothly to simply connected (meaning that any closed a point with out ever leaving the manifold) can in factbe smoothly deformed into a 3-sphere (which is to four-dimensional Euclidean space as the usual two-dimensional sphere is to three-dimensional Euclidean space). The proof of Poincaré’s conjecture is one ofthe most impressive recent achievements of modern mathematics.

III.79 Riemann Surfaces

Alan F. Beardon

Letthe complex plane. If D be a region (that is, a connected open set) inf is a complex-valued function defined onwe would for real-valued functions defined on subsets D, then we can define its derivative just as ofw Rof the “difference quotient”: the derivative off at w is the limit as(f (z) - f (w))/(zz tends to- w). Of course, this limit does not necessarily exist, but if it exists for every or holomorphic, onw in D. Analytic functions have amazing D, then f is said to be analytic, properties;
for example, if a function is analytic in a region, then it automatically has a Taylor-series expansion at each point of the region, from which one can deduce that it is infinitely differentiable. This is in stark contrast to the theory of real functions of a real vari-able, where, for example, a function may be once differentiable but not twice differentiable at some point$x$, yet three-times differentiable at some other pointy. Complex analysis haps more than any other mathematical topic, it is bothis the study of analytic functions.
Per immensely useful in a practical sense and profound and beautiful in a theoretical sense. (Some of the basic results of complex analysis are described in [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).) between isomorphic groups, and topologists do not dis-tinguish between homeomorphic topological spaces, Just as group theorists do not generally distinguish complex analysts do not distinguish between two re - gions D and D^ if there is an analytic bijection between DD^ andare conformally equivalent D^ . When this is the case, we say that.
Conformal equivalence D and is, as its name suggests, an[I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar): the proof depends on the surprising fact that equivalence relation iff - f1 is an analytic bijection from: D^ \to D is also analytic. Again, this contrasts with D to D^ , then its inverse real analysis. If D and D^ are conformally equivalent, then “interesting” properties of analytic functions on D are transferred automatically to corresponding prop- erties of analytic functions defined on D^.
Indeed, this statement can almost be taken as a definition of “inter-esting” properties (although admittedly this conflicts with the numerical side of complex analysis, because purely numerical statements do not usually transfer under such maps). Naturally, we would like to know which properties of analytic functions are “interesting” in this sense. One such property is that (except at cer-tain isolated points) the angle between two intersecting curves in Dis preserved under an analytic map: this is

III. Mathematical Concepts

the origin of the term “conformal.” It is less well-known that if a bijection (which is not assumed to be differentiable) preserves the angles between curves (that is, both their magnitude and whether they are mea-sured clockwise or counter clockwise), then it is analytic. Thus, loosely speaking, the preservation of angles implies the existence of a Taylor series! The impact of complex analysis on other topics is so great that it is natural to try to find the most gen-eral type of surface on which we can study analytic functions.
This leads to the definition of a surface (after bernhard riemann [VI.49], who intro-Riemann duced the idea in his doctoral dissertation). In order to put a coordinate system on a surface map S bijectively onto a plane region D; if we succeed, S we try to then we can transfer the coordinates from many surfaces (for example, a sphere) it is not possible D to S. For to find such a map, and we have to be satisfied with local coordinates. This means that at each pointw of Sand so obtain coordinates that are restricted to, we map a neighborhood N of w onto a plane region, N.
As there are usually infinitely many ways to do this, we are forced to consider the class of transition maps; that is, the maps from one coordinate system atw to another. The surface is asuch transition map is an analytic bijection. This defi-Riemann surface precisely when each nition resembles that of a two-dimensional[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), but the requirement that the transition maps manifold should be analytic is much stronger, so by no means every 2-manifold is a Riemann surface. It is not difficult to construct Riemann surfaces.
Consider, for example, a sphere table.
If we imagine a light source at the highest point S resting on a horizontal P of the sphere, then each point of S except P casts a “shadow” on the table: since the table has a simple coor-dinate system, we can use these “shadows” to define a coordinate system on all ofilarly, a light source at the point Q of tangency with S except the point P. Sim- the table casts a shadow onto the (horizontal) tangent plane at P, and this gives a coordinate system valid through out S except at Q .
It can be shown that if the second coordinate system is composed with a reflec-tion, then the sphere does have the structure of a Riemann surface. This is an extremely important example, because it allows one to handle questions involving infinity in a satisfactory way; it is known as the Riemann sphere For another example, consider a cube. C, and (for sim- plicity only) remove the eight vertices. Given a face F of C(with out its bounding edges), we can find a Euclidean III.80.
The Riemann Zeta Function rigid motion that maps F into C, so we can easily define a coordinate system onan edge E of C, we can “open” the two faces that meet F . If w is an interior point of atmap this region into E to make a planar region that contains C by a Euclidean rigid motion. In E, and then this way we see that surface. The problem with the vertices can be solved by C (less its vertices) is a Riemann technical means, and this method can then be generalized to show that any polyhedron (even one with holes, such as a “square” torus) is a Riemann surface.
These are known asing classical result that each such surface corresponds compact surfaces . It is a deep but fasc in at bijectively to an irreducible polynomial P (z, w) in two complex variables. To give an idea of how the corre-spondence works, let us consider an equation such as w3 + wz + z2 = 0. For each z this can be solved to give three values ofto vary in C, the values$w$, say ww1, vary, and as they do so theyw2, and w3; as we allow zj

This surface can be thought of as lying W , which can be shown to “above” C, and for all but a finite set ofz in C there are exactly three points on As we have mentioned, Riemann surfaces are impor-$W$that are “above”z. tant because they are the most general surfaces on which one can study analytic functions, with all of their remarkable properties. It is easy to define what wemean by an analytic functionf on a Riemann surface R.
Given a coordinate system on part of R, we can think offf as analytic if and only if it depends analytically on theas a function of the coordinates, and we then regard coordinates. Because the transition maps are analytic, f will be analytic with respect to one coordinate system if and only if it is analytic with respect to all the other coordinate systems defined at the point in question. This simple property—that if something holds in one coordinate system, then it holds in all of them—is oneof the crucial features of the theory.
For example, suppose that we have two curves crossing on an (abstract) Riemann surface. If we transfer the two curves to plane regions using different local coordinate systems at the crossing point, and then measure the angle of inter sec-tion in each case, we must get the same result (since the transition from one coordinate system to another preserves angles). It follows that the angle between intersecting curves on an abstract Riemann surface is a well-defined concept. It turns out that analysis on Riemann surfaces goes beyond analytic functions.
Harmonic functions (solutions ofconnected to analytic functions, since the real part of an laplace’s equation [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) are intimately

283

analytic function is harmonic and any harmonic func-tion is (locally) the real part of an analytic function. Thus, on a Riemann surface, complex analysis merges almost imperceptibly with potential theory (which is the study of harmonic functions). Perhaps the most profound theorem of all about Riemann surfaces is the Roughly speaking, this says that every Riemann surface uniformization theorem [V.34](/part-05/the-uniformization-theorem).
is obtained from either Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic geometry (seecal definitions [[I.3 §§6.2, 6.5, 6.6]](/part-01/some-fundamental-mathematical-de-ni tions)) by taking a poly-some fundamental mathemat i gon in that geometry and gluing its sides together, in the same way that one obtains a torus by gluing oppo-site sides of a rectangle together. (See also fuchsian groups [III.28](/part-03/fuchsian-groups).) Remarkably, only very few Riemann surfaces come from the Euclidean or spherical geome-tries;
essentially, every Riemann surface can be constructed in this way from (and only from) the hyperbolic plane. This means that virtually every region inthe complex plane comes equipped with a natural and intrinsic geometry whose character is hyperbolic and not ac ter of a generic plane region comes from its embed-, as one might expect, Euclidean. The Euclidean charding in C, and not from its own intrinsic hyperbolic geometry.
III.80 The Riemann Zeta Function The Riemann zeta functionζis a function defined on the complex numbers that encapsulates in a remark-able way many of the most important properties about the distribution of prime numbers. Ifs is a complex number with real part greater than 1, then defined to be. nfty n - s. The condition that Reζ(s)(s) > is1 is needed to ensure that this series converges. How- n = 1 ever, because the resulting function is[I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions), it is possible to extend the definition by holomorphic means of analytic continuation.
The result is a function that is defined every where on the complex plane(though it takes the value$\infty\text{at} 1)$. A first clue to why this function is related to the distribution of primes is Euler’s product formula:

ζ(s) = (1 - p-s)-1.p

Here, the product on the right-hand side is over all primes. The formula can be proved by writing(1 -p-s )-1 as 1+p-s +(p-2)s +· · · , expanding out the prod- uct, and usingmetic [V.14](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic).

See also L-functions [III.47](/part-03/l-functions).the weil conjectures III.81 Rings, Ideals, and Modules 1 Rings A ring, like aan algebraic structure that satisfies certain axioms. To group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or a field [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), is remember the axioms for both rings and fields at the same time, it is helpful to think of two simple examples: with the two operations of addition and multiplication, the set Z of all integers forms a ring and the set Q of all rational numbers forms a field.
In general, a ring is aset R with two binary operations[I.2 §2.4](/part-01/language-and-grammar), denoted by “+” and “. imes”, which satisfies all the field axioms apart from the one that says that nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. Although the integers are the prototypical example of a ring, the notion arose historically as an abstraction from several sources, one of which was polynomials.
Like integers, polynomials (with real coefficients, say)can be added and multiplied, and these operations have all the properties one might expect, such as the fact that multiplication is distributive over addition, so the space of such polynomials forms a ring. Other examples include the integers modulo integern), the rationals (or indeed any other field), andn (for any positive the set Z[i] of all complex numbers a + bi such that a andb are integers.
commutative and has an identity element are dropped. This leads to a more complicated theory, but it does Some times the assumptions that multiplication is encompass important examples such as the set of alln . imes nmatrices (with elements in a given field, or even just a ring).As with other algebraic structures, there are several ways of forming new rings from old ones: for instance, we can take subrings and direct products of two rings. Slightly less obviously, we can start with a ring form the ring of all polynomials with coefficients in R and R.

III. Mathematical Concepts

We can also take discuss these we must introduce the notion of an ideal.quotients [I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), but in order to 2 Ideals A typical quotient construction for an algebraic struc-ture A will identify some substructure B and regard two elements ofment of B.” If$AA$as “equivalent” if they “differ by an ele-is a group or a vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), then situation for rings is slightly different. B will be a subgroup or a subspace. However, the way:
as images of structures that we like to quotient by are the kernels We can see why if we think about quotients in another homomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). The subof these homomorphisms, so we should ask ourselves what the kernel of a ring homomorphism (that is, theset of elements that map to 0) will be like. Ifφ: R \to  R^  is a homomorphism between two rings, andφ(a) = φ(b) = 0, then φ(a + b) = 0. Also, ifr is any element of R, then φ(r a) = φ(r )φ(a) = 0.
Thus, the kernel of a homomorphism is closed under addition, and also under multiplication by any element of the ring. These two properties define the notion ofan ideal. For example, the set of all even integers is an ideal in Z. In interesting cases, ideals are not subrings, since if an ideal contains 1 then it must con-tainr for every r in the ring. (An example that makes the difference very clear is the subset of the ring of all polynomials that consists of all constant polynomials.
The constants form a subring, but they certainly do not form an ideal.) Rnamely the quotient map from It is not hard to show that for any ideal there is a homomorphism that has R to the quotient I as its kernel, I in a ring R/I. Here R/I is a construction that as usual we think of as “differ by an element of R, but with two elements considered the same if they I.” braic number theory rephrase questions about algebraic numbers as ques-Quotients of rings are extremely useful in[IV.1](/part - 04/number - theory) because they allow us toalgetions about polynomials.
To get an idea of how this isdone, consider the ring Z[X] of all polynomials with integer coefficients, and the ideal that consists of all multiples (by integer polynomials) of the polynomial X2 + 1. In the quotient of Z[X] by this ideal, we regard two polynomials as the same if they differ by a multipleof X2 + 1. In particular, X2 is the same as - 1. In other words, in this quotient ring we have a square root of - 1, and in fact the quotient ring is isomorphic to the ring Z[i] that we met earlier. III.83.
The Schrödinger Equation torize them, and we can try to do the same in rings One of the things we like to do to integers is facas well. However, it turns out that, while it is usually possible to factorize an element of a ring into “irreducible” ones that cannot be factorized further (like the primes in Z), in many cases the factorization is not unique. At first, this might be rather unexpected, and indeed it was a stumbling block for many early workers (in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries). Here is an example:
in the ring Z[. qrt{-3}], which consists of all com- plex numbers the number 4 may be factorized as 2$a + b \sqrt{-3}$, where a and. imes b2 and also asare integers$,(1 + \sqrt{-3}) \times (1 - \sqrt{-3})$. 3 Modules Modules are to rings as vector spaces are to fields. In other words, they are algebraic structures where the basic operations are addition and scalar multiplication, but now the scalars are allowed to come from a ring rather than a field. For an example of a module overa ring that is not a field, take any Abelian group G.
This can be turned into a module over Z, with addition given by the group operation and scalar multiplication defined in the obvious way: for instance, 3 g + g + g, and -2 g means the inverse of g + gg. means the structure of modules is in general far more subtle The simplicity of this definition masks the fact that than that of vector spaces. For example, we can define a basis of a module to be a linearly independent set of elements that spans the module. However, many use-ful facts about bases in vector spaces do not hold for modules.
For instance, ina module over itself, the set Z, which we may consider as$\\{2}$, 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} spans the module but does not contain a basis, and similarly the set2 is linearly independent but cannot be extended to a basis. In fact, modules may be very far from having a basis: for example, if we consider the integers mod ulon as a module over linearly independent, since Z, then even a single element nx = 0. x fails to be The following example of a module is an important one. Letear map from V be a complex vector space and let V to V.
This can be made into a moduleα be a lin- over the ring C[X]: ifv \in  V and P is a complex polyno- mial, thenis the polynomial P vis defined to bex2 +1, then P (α)v P v = α. (For instance, if2 v +v.) Applying P general structural results about modules to this exam-ple, one obtains a proof of the jordan normal form theorem [III.43](/part-03/jordan-normal-form).

One frequently finds in the history of mathematics that a definition thought to be completely general was in fact too restrictive to treat certain problemsof interest. The notion of “number,” for instance, has been expanded again and again—most notably to incor-porate irrationalities and complex numbers, the former arising from problems in geometry and the latter needed in order to describe solutions to arbitrary algebraic equations.
In a similar way, algebraic geometry, which was once understood as the study ofbraic varieties, or solution sets of algebraic equations algein some finite-dimensional space, has grown to encom-pass more general objects known as “schemes.” As a very meager example one might consider the two equa-tionsx + y = 0 and (x + y)2 = 0. The two equations have the same set of solutions in the plane, so they describe the same variety; but the schemes attached to the two objects are completely different.
The reformu-lation of algebraic geometry in the language of schemes was a tremendous project spearheaded by Alexander Grothendieck in the 1960 s. As the above example suggests, the scheme-theoretic viewpoint tends to empha-size the algebraic aspects of the subject (equations) rather than the traditionally geometric ones (solution sets of equations).
This viewpoint has made a reality of the long-hoped-for unification of algebraic number theory much recent progress in number theory would have[IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) and algebraic geometry, and, indeed, been impossible with out the geometric insight suppliedby the theory of schemes. problems of current interest, and still more general notions (stacks, “noncommutative varieties,” derived Even schemes are not enough to handle all the categories of sheaves, etc.) are brought to bear when necessary.
These can appear exotic, but to our successors they will no doubt be second nature, just as schemes are to us. For more on algebraic geometry in general, see discussed at greater length inalgebraic geometry arithmetic geometry[IV.4](/part-04/algebra). Schemes are [IV.5](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry). III.83 The Schrödinger Equation

In mathematical physics, the Schrödinger equation(and the closely related Heisenberg equation) are the

most fundamental equations in nonrelativistic quan-tum mechanics, playing the same role as Hamilton’s laws of motion (and the closely related Poisson equation) in nonrelativistic classical mechanics. (In relativis-tic quantum mechanics, the equations of quantum field theory take over the role of Heisenberg’s equation, while Schrödinger’s equation does not have a natural direct analogue.) In pure mathematics, the Schrödingerequation, together with its variants, is one of the basic equations studied in the field oftial equations [IV.12](/part-04/analysis), and has applications to geom-partial
diff erene try, to spectral and scattering theory, and to integrable systems. The Schrödinger equation can be used to describe the quantum dynamics of many-particle systems under the influence of a variety of forces, but for simplicity let us consider just a single particle, of mass about inn - dimensional space Rn subject to the influ - m > 0, moving ence of a potential, which we shall take to be a function V: Rn \to  R.

The energy of this state is described by[III.35](/part - 03/hamiltonians) H: R$n \times R^{n} \to R$ on phase space, defined in this case by hamiltonian function

However,ψ(t) does it does have an average positionq(t), defined as $q(t) = Qψ(t)$, ψ(t) =^R^n q|ψ(t, q)|^2 dq.

More generally, given anywe mean a self-adjoint quantum observable operator [III.50](/part - 03/linear - operators - and - their - properties)A, by which acting on the space L2(Rn) of complex-valued square integrable functions, we can define the average value A(t) of A equal 1.1.

(compare this with (4)). More generally, the impor-tant subject of spectral theory provides many links between the time-dependent equation (5) and the time-independent equation (7). tions of classical mechanics and those of quantum There are several strong analogies between the equa mechanics. For instance, from (6) one has the equations dd t q(t) = m1 p(t), ddt p(t) = −∇q V (q)(t), which should be compared with (2). Also, given any classical solution$t \to (q(t)$, p(t))to Hamilton’s equation of motion, one can construct a corresponding family of approximate solutionsψ(t)to Schrödinger’s

ψ(t, q) = (e(()i){/})L(t)(e(()i){/})p(t()·)(q-q(t))φ(q - q(t)), where

$L(t) =0^{t} p(s)2m^{2} - V (q(s))ds$

is the function that is normalized in the sense that classical action andφ is any slowly varying|φ(q)|2 dq = 1.

One can verify that that are small when Rψn solves (5) except for some errors is small. In physics, this fact is an example of the asserts that classical mechanics can be used to approx-correspondence principle, which imate quantum mechanics accurately if Planck’s con-stant is small and one is working at macroscopic scales (which is what allows us to use slowly varying func-tionsφ).
In mathematics (and more precisely in the fields ofsis), there are a number of formalizations of this prin-microlocal analysis and semi-classical analyciple that allow us to use knowledge about the behav-ior of Hamilton’s equations of motion in order to analyze the Schrödinger equation.
For example, if the classical equations of motion have periodic solutions, then the Schrödinger equation often has nearly peri-odic solutions, where as if the classical equations have very chaotic solutions, then the Schrödinger equation typically does as well (this phenomenon is known as quantum chaos There are many aspects of the Schrödinger equationor quantum ergodicity). that are of interest. We mention just one of them here for illustration, namely that of scattering theory.

The study of all of these variants leads to a vast and diverse field in both pure mathematics and in mathematical physics. III.84 The Simplex Algorithm

1 Linear Programming

The simplex algorithm is the preeminent tool for solv-ing some of the most important mathematical problems arising in business, science, and technology. In these problems, which are called linear programs, we are to maximize (or minimize) a linear function subject to linear constraints. An example is the diet prob-lem posed by the U.S. Air Force in 1947: find quantities of seventy-seven differently priced foodstuffs (cheese, spinach, etc.) to satisfy a man’s minimum daily requirements for nine nutrients (protein, iron, etc.) at least cost.
Further applications occur in choosing the elements of an investment portfolio, rostering an airline’screw, and finding optimal strategies in two-person games. The study of linear programming has inspired many of the central ideas of optimization theory, such as computational complexity duality [III.19](/part-03/duality), the importance of convexity, and[IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity). two vectors A The input data of a linear program (LP) consists of= (a ).

The two dotted lines mark those the value of the objective function value is 4 and wherex where it is 6. Clearly, it is maximized at point C. If the feasible region Pnonempty, then it is a convex polytope in The general story is similar to that of the example.$= {x}$:

$-x^{1} + 2x^{2} + x^{3} = 2$,$2$ x(x1)1 +- x(x2)2 + x4 + x5 == 4,5.

We now have three equations in five variables, so we can set any two of the variables and solve the equations for the other three variables$x^{1}$, . . . , x5 equal to 0, (or solve a perturbation of them if they happen notto be independent). There are ten ways to choose two variables from five. Not all of the ten corresponding solutions sat is fyx , x , x , x , x ⩾0, but five of them do. These are called1 basic feasible solutions2 3 4 5 (BFSs), and correspond to the vertices of P marked O, B, C, D, E.

III.84. The Simplex Algorithm

2 How the Algorithm Works

George Dantzig invented the simplex algorithm in 1947 as a means of solving the Air Force’s diet problem mentioned at the start. The word “program” was not yet used to mean computer code, but was a military term for a logistic plan or schedule. The fundamental fact on which the algorithm relies is that if an LP has a bounded optimal solution, then the optimum value is attained at a BFS, i.e., at a vertex (or so-called “extreme point”) ofthe polytope of feasible points, P. Another name for the feasible polytope is “simplex,” which is where the algorithm gets its name. It works as follows.
Step 0. Pick a BFS. Step 1. Test whether this BFS is optimal. If so, stop. If not, go to step 2. Step 2. Find a better BFS. Repeat from step 1. Since there are only finitely many BFSs (i.e., vertices of P), the algorithm must stop. Now that we have an over view, let us look at the details. Suppose that at step 0 we pick the BFS of x = (x$, x , x , x , x ) = (0,0, 2, 4, 5)$, correspond- ing to vertex O. At step 1 we wish to know whether the objective function can be increased if1 2 3 4 5$x^{1} or x^{2} is$ increased from 0.
So we write tive functionc^Tx in terms ofxx^3, xand^4, x^5 x, and the objec-, and display 1 2 this as dictionary 1. Dictionary 1 x^3 = 2 + x^1 - 2 x^2, x^4 = 4 - x^1 - x^2, x^5 = 5 - 2 x^1 + x^2, c^Tx = x^1 + 2 x^2.

increase the value of The last equation in the dictionary shows that we canc Tx by increasing either x1 or x2 from 0. Suppose that we increase ond equations show thatx and xx2 must decrease, and. The first and secwe cannot increase an dx = 3, x = x6. Increasing2 beyond 1, at which poin(t3)4 x as much as pos-x3 = 0 sible, we complete step 2 and arrive at a new BFS ofx = (04,1,0,3,65), which is vertex B. Now we are ready2 for step 1 again, and so we write terms of the variables that are now zero, namely x2$, x4$, x5, and xc Tx, xin, 1 3 to give dictionary 2.
289 Dictionary 2 Dictionary 3$x2 = 1 + 1 2 x1 - 1 2 x3$, x1 = 2 + 1 3 x3 - 2 3 x4, x4 = 3 - 3 2 x1 + 1 2 x3, x2 = 2 - 1 3 x3 - 1 3 x4, x5 = 6 - 3 2 x1 - 1 2 x3, x5 = 3 - x3 + x4, c Tx = 2 + 2 x1 - x3. c Tx = 6 - 1 3 x3 - 4 3 x4. This shows thatc Tx can be increased by inc re as in gx because at that point1 from 0, but that x1 xcan increase no further than 2 = 0. This brings us to a new solution are ready for step 1, and so compute dictionary 3, now(2, 2, 0, 0, 3), which is vertex C.
Once more, we4 writing things in terms ofalgorithm now stops because, as we require$x^{3} and x^{4}$, which are 0. Thex , x ⩾ 0, the bottom line of dictionary 3 proves that all feasible$x$. c Tx3 ⩽46 for dictionary. If(There is other important information in the final,  ,  ), then the maximum value ofb is changed to b + , for smallc Tx will change T = to 6 price,” because it is what we should be willing to pay1+2 1 3 3 1 +4 3 2. The coefficient 13 is called a “shadow per unit increase in b1.
3 How the Algorithm Performs In running the simplex algorithm the serious work comes in computing the dictionaries. To find dictionary 2, we could use the first equation of dictionary 1 to rewritex2 in terms of x1 and x3, and then substitute for algorithm have been invented that reduce the comput - x2 in the other equations. Versions of the simplex ing effort by taking advantage of special structure in the matrix are zero.
The dictionary data is often held in a so - called A, such as the fact that most of its entries tableau There are many other practical and theoretical issues.of coefficients.
One concerns the selection of the pivot, that is, the variable that is to be increased from 0. Starting at O, and depending on which ofx1 and x2 we choose as the first variable to increase from zero, the path to C can be O, E, D, C or O, B, C. There is no known way to guarantee that the algorithm takes the shortest path. rithm really needs is related to the famous je ct ure The question of how many steps the simplex algo-:
that for any bound edn-dimensional polytope Hirsch con- with number of edges on the shortest edge-traversing pathmfaces, the diameter (defined as the maximum between any two vertices) is at mostm - n. If this were true, it would suggest that some version of the sim-plex algorithm might run in a number of steps that 290 grows only linearly in the numbers of variables and constraints.
However, Klee and Minty (1972) have given an example based on a perturbed($m = 2 n \text{faces and diameter} n)$, in which if the algo-n-dimensional cube rithm selects among possible pivots by choosing theone for which the objective function increases at the greatest rate per unit increase in that variable, thenit visits all 2 n vertices before reaching the optimum. Indeed, for most deterministic pivot selection rules, examples are known in which the number of steps grows exponentially in Fortunately, things are usually much better in prac-n. tical problems than in worst-case examples.
Typically, only O(m) steps are needed to solve a problem withm analysis of the so-called constraints. More over, Khachian (1979) proved (byellipsoid algorithm) that linear programs can in principle be solved by an algorithm whose running time grows only polynomially in linear programming is much easier than “integer linearn. Thus programming,” in which integers and for which no algorithm with polynomial x1, . . . , xn are required to be running time is known. Karmarkar (1984) pioneered development of “interior” methods for linear programming problems.
These move through the interior of the polytope P, rather than among its vertices, and can some times solve large LPs more quickly than the simplex algorithm. Modern com-puter software uses both methods and can easily solve LPs with millions of variables and constraints. Further Reading Dantzig, G. 1963.Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

If we try$f (x) = P (x)/Q(x)$, where P and Q are polynomials with no common factors, then we find that

By comparing coefficients we can show that P (0) = 0, which shows that, contrary to our assump-Q(0) = tions, both can not solve equation (1) in terms of known functions.

and, using the formula for differentiating an inverse function, we find that F-1 is the solution of the differential equation

g^ (x) = g(x). We therefore give the function a name (theand add it to our list of standard functions. logarithm) At a more advanced level, integration by parts shows that the[VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783)) gamma function [III.31](/part - 03/the - gamma - function) (introduced by eulerΓ (x) =0 . nf ty (tx()-1 e)-t dt, defined for allx > 0, has the property thatΓ (x) = (x - 1)Γ (x - 1) for all integers$x >n ⩾1$, and therefore1 (since Γ (1) = Γ (n)1). As one might expect= (n - 1)!
for all from its association with factorials, the gamma func-tion turns out to be very useful in number theory and statistics. In practice, a “special function” is any function that, like the logarithm and the gamma function, has been extensively studied and has turned out to be useful. Some authors use the phrase “special functions” in amore restricted sense, meaning something like “functions that turn up in the solution of physical problems” III.85.
Special Functions or “functions other than those generally provided by a pocket calculator,” but these restrictions do not seem to be very useful.
 In spite of this apparent generality, the theory of special functions is linked in the minds of many mathe-maticians to a collection of particular ideas and methods. Indeed, it is often linked to particular books like Whittaker and Watson’s A Course of Modern Analysis (which was first published in 1902 and is still selling well) and Abramowitz and Stegun’s Mathematical Functions.
These connections may sim-Handbook of ply be accidents of history, but the phrase “special functions” is often associated with other phrases like “equations of mathematical physics,” “beautiful formulas,” and “sheer ingenuity.” We illustrate this and other themes in the particular case of Legendre polynomials.
(The next paragraph involves more advanced mathe-matics and glosses over several long calculations, but the reader may simply glance over its contents and resume careful reading there after.) Suppose that we wish to examine the gravitational potential place’s equationψ of Earth by looking at solutions of[I.3 §5.4](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). eltaψ = 0.
Since Earth is anla- oblate spheroid that is nearly spherical, we use spher-ical polar coordinates(r , θ, φ) and, noting that Earth is symmetric about its axis of rotation, we may suppose that assumptions, Laplace’s equation takes the formψ depends only on r and θ. Under these. in θ . artial r. artial r2 . artialψ. artial r + . artialθ. artial . in θ . artialψ. artialθ = 0.

After a little calculation, equation (2) yields R(r )1 ddr (r2 R^ (r )) = − . in θΘ(θ)1 ddθ (. in θΘ^ (θ)). (3) Since one side of equation (3) depends onand the other onθ alone, both sides must equal somer alone constantk. The equation$1 d$(r2 R^ (r )) = k R(r ) dr

III.86 The Spectrum

G. R. Allan

In the theory of linear maps [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), or operators, on avalue and eigenvector vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), the notions of[I.3 §4.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) play an important eigen role. Recall that ifif T: V \to V is a linear mapping, then an V is a vector space (over eigenvector R or C) and of T is a nonzero vector e in V such that T (e) = . ambda e for some scalar to the eigenvectorλ; thene.
If. ambda is the Vis finite dimensional, then the eigenvalue corresponding eigenvalues are also the roots of thenomialχ(t) = . et (t I - T ) of T. Because every noncon-characteristic poly- stant complex polynomial has a root (the so-called da mental theorem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra)), it follows that fun every linear operator on a finite-dimensional, complex vector space has at least one eigenvalue. If the scalar field isconsider a rotation about the origin in R, then not all operators have eigenvectors (e.g., R2).
The linear operators that arise in analysis usually act on infinite-dimensional spaces (see [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties)). We con-sider continuous linear operators acting on a complex banach space as operators (even though not all linear operators on[III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces); these will be referred to simply an infinite-dimensional Banach space are continuous).We shall now see that, for Xin finite dimensional, not every such operator has an eigenvalue.

Then T is said to be S on X invertible for which T if andbe an ST =T S = I (here, ST is the composition of S and T, and I is the identity operator on invertible if and only if T is both X ). It can be shown that injective (i.e., T (x)T = is0 only for$x = 0) \text{and surjective} (i$.e., T (X) = X ).
The part here that is not just simple algebra is to show that ifis both injective and surjective, then the linear inverse TT-1 is a continuous operator. A complex number . ambda is an eigenvalue of T precisely if T - . ambda I is not injective. operator and hence invertible. For If V is a Tfinite-dimensional: V \to  V is necessarily also surjective, Xin finite dimensional this space, then an injective implication is no longer valid.

With this example in mind, we make the following Definition 3.T be an operator on Let X be a complex Banach space and let X.
The spectrum of T , denoted by Spthat T T(or-σ (T ). ambda I is not invertible.), is the set of all complex numbers . ambda such The following remarks should be clear. (i) Ifof eigenvalues of Xis finite dimensional, then Sp T. T is just the set (ii) For general X, Sp T includes the set of eigenvalues ofnot an eigenvalue of T , but may be larger (e.g., in example 2, 0 is S, but 0 does belong to the spectrum of S). bounded A rather deeper fact is that it is never empty:

However, We have already seen that not they do have an easily described spectrum.

(Seeand their properties [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) for an amplification linear operators of this remark.)One reason for the importance of Fourier analysis is that many important linear operators become diagonal, and hence particularly easy to understand, when they are applied to the Fourier transform of a function.

This provides a very useful technique for solving differential equations. As has already been mentioned, spherical harmonics are eigenvectors of the Laplacian, but they also diag-onalize several other linear operators.
A good example is theas follows. Ifspherical Radon trans formf is a function from S, which is defined$d^{-1} to R$, then its spherical Radon transform(Sd)-1 to R, and the value of Rf Rfis another function fromat a point x is the aver- age value off over all points y that are orthogonal totransform, which replaces a function defined on thex. This is closely related to the more usual Radon plane by its averages over lines; inverting the radon transform is important for creating images from the outputs of medical scanners.
The spherical harmonics turn out to be eigenfunctions for the spherical Radon transform. More generally, any transform$T f (x) = w(x · y)f (y) d\mu(y)$, where w Tis a suitableof the form S

The usual definition is that they are sequences of polynomials, one for each degree, that are uniquely determined by certain orthogonality relations.

2.1 Hamilton’s Equations

How can we produce nonlinear symplectic maps? Letus begin by exploring a familiar example. Consider the motion of a simple pendulum with len gthm and let q(t) be the angle it makes with the ver ti call and mass at timet. The equation of motion is$dd2$ tq2 + gl . in q = 0,

The Irish mathematician william rowan hamilton [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) showed us how to do this in general more than170 years ago. Given any smooth function$H$: R2$n \to$ R (called the Hamiltonian), the system of first-order differential equations given by dd$qt^{i} = \partial p\partial H$, i = 1, . . .

2.2 Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem

What is the difference between a symplectic map and a volume-preserving map? In order to answer this question, suppose that we have two connected open sets and V in (R2)n and that we wish to embed one into the U other using a symplectic map. This means that we are looking for a symplectic mapφ: U \to V such that φ is a homeomorphism onto its image. We know such aφ must be volume preserving, so we clearly have the restriction that the volume ofthe volume of V, but is this restriction all that mat-U should be at most ters?
Consider the open ball B(R) = {x \in (R2)n}:$|x| <R$, which has radius R and center at the origin, and clearly has finite volume. It is not hard to embed it symplectically into the infinite-volume cylinder given by $C(r ) = {(q}$, p) \in (R2)n}:(q2)1 + (q2)2 < r2, whatever the values of symplectic map R and r . Indeed, the linear(q, p) \to  (aq1$, aq2$, q3, . . . , qn$, p1/a$, p2/a, p3, . . . , pn) will do the trick when i tive.
However, the situation is radically different if$a$is sufficiently small and pos instead we consider the infinite-volume cylinder $Z(r ) = \\{(q}$, p) \in (R2)n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}:$(q1)2 + (p2)1 < r2$. We could try with a similar linear map like (q, p) \to (aq1, q2/a, q3, . . . , qn, ap1, p2/a, p3, . . . , pn). This map is volume preserving (it has determinant 1)and fora small it embeds B(R) into Z(r ). However, it is symplectic only ifembedding only if R ⩽ar=.
One is tempted to think that if1, so it will give a symplectic R > rembedding squeezing, then there should still be a nonlinear symplectic B(R) into Z(r ), but a remarkable theorem of Gromov from 1985 asserts that it is not possible to find such a map. In spite of this deep result of Gromov, and other results that followed it, we still do not know much about how sets in R2 n embed into one another.

sical theorem of Darboux asserts that this abstract def-inition is equivalent to the more concrete definition using coordinate charts. Finally, a special class of symplectic manifolds is given by folds that are also Kähler manifolds complex manifolds. These are symplectic mani-, in such a way that the two structures are naturally compatible, a condition that generalizes the relationship (1). Observe that if one identifies points(q, p) in (R2)n with points p + iq in Cn, then the linear transformation J$: R2$ n \to (R2)n becomes the operation of multiplication by i: $J$:$(z1$, . . .

Thus the identity (1) relates the symplectic structure(as given byω0), the complex structure (as given by J), and the Riemannian structure (as given by the dot prod-uct “·”). A complex manifold is a manifold that at small distance scales looks like regions of Cn, with the tran- sition functions required to be(A smooth map$f$: U ⊂ Cn \to  Ch ol om or ph i cn is said to be holomor-[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). phic if each coordinate component of holomorphic in each variable$z^{k}$.) On a complex mani-f (z1, . . .

A Kähler manifold is$pp$ a complex manifold(which computes signed areas of infinitesimal parallel-M with a symplectic structure ω ograms) and a Riemannian metric an inner prod uctg (v, v^ ) of any two tangent vectorsg (which compute sv the analogue of (1), namely, v at p); these two structures are linked together by$pω^{p} (v$, v^ ) = gp (v^ , Jp v).

The Many important maps, such as tensor product inner U ⊗products V of two vector spaces of the “most general” bilinear map that we can define U and V is a way of capturing the idea on U . imes  V. To get an idea of what this might mean, let us try to imagine a “completely arbitrary” bilin-ear map from$U \times V$to a “completely arbitrary” vector space W , and let us use the notation u ⊗ v instead ofφ(u, v)eral, all we know about it is what we can deduce from.

This example might sug- gest that all elements of1 2 1 U2⊗ V are of the form u ⊗ v, but that is certainly not the case: for instance, in gen-eral there is no way of simplifying an expression such asof values taken by a bilinear map from$u^{1} ⊗ v^{1} + u^{2} ⊗ v^{2}$.
(This reflects the fact that the set$U \times V to W is$ not in general a subspace of Thus, a typical element of UW⊗.) V is a linear combina- tion of elements of the formu ⊗ v, with the rule that different linear combinations give the same element of U ⊗ V whenever they are forced to by the bilinearity property: for instance,$(u^{1} + 2u^{2})⊗(v^{1} - v^{2}) \text{will always}$ be equal to $u^{1} ⊗ v^{1} + 2u^{2} ⊗ v^{1} - u^{1} ⊗ v^{2} - 2u^{2} ⊗ v^{2}$. to say that A more formal way of expressing the above ideas is U ⊗ V has a universal property.

Some times the tensor product module [III.81 §3](/part - 03/rings - ideals - and - modules) or a of two structures is not what you would immediately expect. For instance, let - algebra Z be the set of integers modn, and consider both their tensor product is zero. This reflects the fact that Zn andn Q as modules over Z.

How might we generalize this notion, replacing R by an arbitrary set sense only if we can decide when two points$X$? Our existing definition makes$x$, x^ \in X are close. For a general set, which might not be nicely embedded in Euclidean space, this is impossible with out the addition of further structure. (When such structure is added one has the notion of a[III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces): metric spaces are less general than topological metric space spaces.) If the notion of closeness is unavailable, how should one define continuity? The answer may be found in thenotion of an open set.
A set U ⊂ R is said to be open if for any pointx in U there is an interval (a, b) that contains It is an amusing exercise to check that ifx (that is, a < x < b) and is contained inf: R$U \to$. R is continuous, and if Conversely, iff-1(U) Uis open for every open setis open, then f-1(U) is open. U , thenf is continuous. Thus, at least for functions from R to R, one may characterize continuity purely in terms of open sets. The notion of closeness is used only when it comes to defining what an open set is. space of We now turn to the formal definition.

contain spaces (of whichx1 and x2 R, respectively. Hausdorff topological is an obvious example) have many useful properties that general topological spaces do not necessarily have. We saw earlier that for functions from R to R the notion of continuity could be formulated entirely in terms of open sets. This means that we can define continuity for functions between topological spaces: ifand Y are two topological spaces and if f:$X \to XY$ is a function between them, then we simply define to be continuous iff-1(U) is open for every open setf U ⊂ Y.
Remarkably, we have found a useful definition of continuity that does not rely on a notion of distance. A continuous map that has a continuous inverse is known as aphism between two spaces homeomorphism. If there is a homeomor-X and Y , then they are regarded as equivalent from the point of view of topology.

It is often fun to take a familiar concept, that applies to R or R2, say, and try to find an analogue of it in the world of general topological spaces. We give two examples. Connectedness. The rough idea of connectedness is that a connected set is one that does not break up into pieces in an obvious way.
Most people would imagine that they could discern, from a list of pictures of rea-son ably sensible subsets of R2, which were connected and which were not. But can one give a precise math-ematical definition that applies to all sets, including potentially very wild ones, and says whether they are connected or not? For example, is the space $S = ((Q \times R) ∪ (R \times Q)) \ (Q \times Q)$, which consists of all points with exactly one rational coordinate, connected or not (with the subspace topology)?
It turns out that a definition can indeed be given, and more over that it applies not just to R2 but to general topological spaces.

The probability that their sum is k is given bv of by the number ck defined above. If we take bothau andbfair die (so they are equal tou to be the probability of throwing1 if 1 u⩽with an ordinaryu ⩽ 6, and 0 otherwise), then

Pc(t) = Pa(t)Pb(t)= ( {}16(t + t2 + · · · + t6))2.

This polynomial can be rewritten as

361(t(t= +1 (t(t1)(t4++1)(tt2 + 2 + 1))(t(tt + 1))(t(t2 + t + 4 + 1)(t(t2)3++11)(t))3 + 1))= P36 A(t)PB(t),

where$A = \text{AA and} = {}^{1}B$, Aare two different sequences, given by$= A = {}^{2}$, and A = 0 otherwise,$and1$(B1)4= (B3)6= (B2)4 = (B3)5 = (B6)6 = (B8)u=1 6$, and B^{v} = 0$

otherwise. Thus, if we take two fair dice number A so that it has 2 on two faces, 3 on two faces, A and B and 1 on one face, and 4 on the remaining face, and we number B so that it has 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 on its faces, then the probability of throwing a sum with an ordinary pair of dice. It is not hard to show, byk is the same as considering the roots of the polynomial$t + t^{2}+· · ·+t^{6}$, that this is the only nonstandard labeling of dice with strictly positive integers that has this property. sequences.
Ifan “infinite polynomial”These general ideas are easily extended to infinite a is the sequence(Ga)(t)a0, ato be1, . . ., we can define$\infty\text{a}^{r}t^{r}$. For the moment, we shall proceed formally, with out worry-ing in what sense the sum exists. Observe that, much$r = 0$ as before,

and so, using partial fractions,

Thus we can make change for whenr is odd and1(r +2) ways whenr dollars inr is even. In thi(s1)2 (r +1) ways simple case it is easy to obtain the result directly but the2 method indicated works automatically in all cases. (the calculations can be made easier if we allow ourselves to work with complex roots.)We have produced a “generating function transform” or “$G$-transform,” which takes a sequence$\infty ^{r} a^{0}$, a1, . . . into a Taylor series not standard: most mathematicians would simply talk$r = 0 a^{r}x$.
(These names are about next two examples show how we can use generating functions [[IV.18 §§2.4, 3]](/part-04/enumerative-and-algebraic-combinatorics).) The G-transforms to restate problems about sequences as problems about Taylor series. Consider first the problem of finding a sequence$u \text{such that} u = 0$, u = 1, and(n0)1(un)+2 - 5(un)+1 + 6 un = 0

for alln ⩾ 0. Observe that we must have(un)+2(tn)+2 - 5(un)+1(tn)+2 + 6 un(tn)+2 = 0 for alln ⩾ 0, so that summing over all n ⩾ 0 yields((Gu)(t)-u1 t-u0)-5(t(Gu)(t)-u0)+6 t2(Gu)(t) = 0. Recalling that$u^{0} = 0$, u1 = 1, and rearranging, we obtain

$(6t^{2} - 5t + 1)(Gu)(t) = t$.

Thus, using partial fractions, we obtain

(Gu)(t) = 6 t2 - t5 t + 1 = (1 - 2 t)(t 1 - 3 t)= 1 --12 t + 1 - 1 3 t= −r . nfty = 0(2 t)r +r . nfty = 0(3 t)r= . nfty (3 r - 2 r )tr.

It follows that$ur==0 3r - 2r$.r

sequence Next consider the rather trivial problem of finding aun such that u0 = 1 and(n + 1)(un)+1 + un = 0

for alln ⩾ 0. For every t we have(n + 1)(un)+1 tn + untn = 0

and so, summing over all laws of differentiation apply to infinite sums, we obt a inn and assuming that the usual(Gu)^ (t) + (Gu)(t) = 0.

This differential equation gives$(Gu)(t) = Ae^{-t} for$ some constant$A$. Setting t = 0, we obtain$1$= u0 = (Gu)(0) = Ae0 = A. III.91. Transforms Thus (Gu)(t) = e - t = r . nf ty = 0 (-r1!)r tr,$so$ u = (-1)r /r!.

It is also important that we can recover the sequence from its G-transform. One way of seeing this is to notea that

$a^{r} = (Ga)r^{(}r )$!(0).

to convert problems about sequences into problems We can use these rules, as in the examples above, about functions and vice versa. In textbooks and exam-inations, the effect of such a transformation is to make things simpler. In real life, it will usually convert your problem into a more complicated problem. However, occasionally you strike lucky and it is these occasions that make transforms such a valuable weapon in the mathematician’s armory. Up to now we have handled G-transforms formally.

Much of the analysis that is typically taught in the firstyear or two of a university mathematics course was developed in the context of this transform and related topics. Using that analysis, it is not hard to obtain the correspondences

F(t) ←→ (FF)(λ)$, F(t) + G(t) ←→ (FF)(λ) + (FG)(λ)$, F^* G(t) ←→ (FF)(λ)(FG)(λ)$, F(t + u) ←→ (e - i)uλ(F F)(λ)$, F^ (t) ←→ i. ambda F F(λ).

In this context we define the convolution of. nf ty F and G by F* G(t) =−. nfty F(t - s)G(s) ds.

There is an element of truth in the saying that the importance of the Fourier transform is that it converts convolution to multiplication and the importance of convolution is that it is the operation that is transformed to multiplication by the Fourier transform. Justas we can use the$G$-transform to solve difference equations, we can use the F -transform to solve important classes ofthat occur in physics and some parts of probability partial differential equations [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) theory.

Like the Fourier sum formula, this formula can be proved under a wide range of circum-Fourier in version st ances, though often at the price of reinterpreting the formula in novel ways. should be noted that, both in practice and in theory, we often need only the observation that Beautiful though the Fourier in version formula is, it$FF = F G$ implies F = G. The uniqueness of the Fourier trans- form is often easier to prove and more convenient to use, and it holds over a wider range of conditions than the in version formula.
A similar observation holds for other transforms. When we talked about the Fourier sums associated with 2 sured the proportion of the signalπ-periodic functions, we said that ˆf with frequencyf (r ) mea-$2$πr. In the same way, (FF)(λ) gives a measure of the proportion of There is a family of inequalities, known generically as F composed of frequencies close to λ.

The Laplace transform shares many of the properties of the Fourier transform andwe can use these, as well as the extensive collection of results on holomorphic functions, whenever we manip-ulate Laplace transforms.
Many of the deepest results in number theory, such as the[V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860), are most easily obtained by clever uses of the prime number theorem Laplace transform. The transforms we have discussed all belong to the same family, as is indicated by the fact that they all take convolution to multiplication.
The general idea of a transform has been developed in several different directions, generally by concentrating on some aspects of the “classical transforms” and being prepared to lose others. One of the most important of these new transforms is thetation of the abstract Gelfand transform, which gives a concrete re pre sen-commutative Banach algebras. It is discussed in operator algebras [IV.15 §3.1](/part-04/operator-algebras). Other integral transforms Fourier transform by setting up a correspondence extend the integral definition of the

Suppose also that$f$is a function defined on R3 that represents how much radiation is absorbed by different parts ofthe body. What we can measure is the amount of radiation absorbed along any given straight line. We might present some of this information in the form of a two dimensional image, which could represent the amount absorbed by all lines in the directionu.
In general, we can usefto define a new function. nfty(Rf )(u, v) =−$\infty$ f (tu + v) dt,

III.92 Trigonometric Functions Ben Green The basic trigonometric functions “sin” and “cos,” aswell as the four related functions “tan,” “cot,” “sec,” and “cosec,” will probably be familiar to most readers in some form. One way to define the sine function sin : R\to [-1,1] is as follows.
In almost all branches of mathematics one measures angles using length: to say that the angle radians, which are defined in terms of arc-∠AOB in figure 1 isθ radi- ans is to say that the arc AB of the circle has length This definition makes sense when 0$⩽ θ < 2π$.

To define it on all of R one simply insists that it be periodic with period 2 it satisfies the relation sinθ = . in (2πnπ+(that is, thatθ) for any integern). What do we mean by the There is one problem with our definition of sine.length of the arc AB? The only really satisfactory way of understanding this isto use calculus. The equation of the unit circle is yquadrant.

(This may be thought of as a definition, though the motivation for the definition comes from pictures.) Forthe circle, 1+ (dx/dy)2 = 1#1 - y2.

for 0⩽ θ ⩽ π/2 (we do not care about what x is). This can be regarded as giving a precise, even if implicit, definition of sin$θ for 0 ⩽ θ ⩽ π/2$. matics, sin may be defined in a multitude of equivalent ways. Another definition (whose equivalence to the first As with many of the most natural concepts in ma the one is not obvious) is $\sin z = z - z$3!3$+ z$5!5- z7!7+ · · · . (2) This infinite series converges for all realz. The result- ing definition has a distinct advantage over (1), in thatit also makes sense whenz is an arbitrary complex number (that is why we replaced the letterθ by z).
It therefore allows us to extend sin to a function [I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) on C. holomorphic If the sine function is analytic, then what is its derivative? The answer is the cosine function cosbe defined in much the same way as sin: either geo - z, which may metric ally or using a power series. The power series is$\cos (z) = 1 - z2!2$+ z4!4- z6!6+ · · · , (3) which may be obtained by differentiating the series forsin term by term (naturally, this is an operation that must be properly justified, but it can be).
(d If one differentiates again, one gets the formula2$/dz2) \sin z = − \sin z$. In fact, it is possible to define III. Mathematical Concepts sin : ential equation R\to [-1, 1]yas the unique solution^ = −ythat also satisfies the initialyto the differ value conditionsy(0) = 0, y^ (0) = 1. This is a very sensible way of proving that the two definitions (1) and(2) are equivalent (it is a good calculus exercise to prove that sin$= − \text{sin using} (1))$.
display the most important side of sin and cos, which is Ultimately, the power series expansions (2) and (3) their relation with the exponential function [III.25](/part - 03/the - exponential - and - logarithmic - functions): e$z = 1 + z + z2!2$+ z3!3$+ · · ·$. Comparing this with (2) and (3), one gets the famous formula ei$θ = \cos θ + \text{i sin}θ$. The exponential functionsθ \to (ei)nθ are characters, that is, circle homomorphisms S1 (which form groups under addition mod 2[I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from R/2πZ to the unitπ and multiplication, respectively).
This makes them the natural objects with which to do a fourier analysis [III.27](/part - 03/the - fourier - transform) of 2π-periodic functions on R. Because sin and cos are real - valued, it is convenient to try to decompose such a functionf (x) not into exponentials, but as a series a0 + a1 . os x + b1 . in x + a2 cos 2 x + b2 sin 2 x + · · ·.
Under favorable circumstances (if the function fic ient ly smooth, say) one can recover the coefficients$f \text{is suf} - a^{i}$, bi by using orthogonality relations such as 1 2π. os  nx . os  mx dxπ0⎧⎨0 for all n, m ⩾ 0, n . eq m,=⎩1 n = m, and 1 2π. os nx . in  mx dx = 0 for all n, m ⩾ 0.π0

Thus, for example, we have

an = π(10)2π f (x) . os nx dx.

Such decompositions into trigonometric functions ulti-mately under lie devices like compact disk players and mobile phones. Let us conclude by remarking that there is a whole zoo of formulas concerning sin, cos, and the other four trigonometric functions (which we have not discussed here), as well as integrals involving these functions. It is these formulas that make the trigonometric functionsan indispensable tool in classical Euclidean geometry. There are many further formulas in that setting. To

Uncountable Sets See countable and uncountable sets [III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets) III.93 Universal Covers Let X be a topological space [III.90](/part - 03/topological - spaces). A loop in X can be defined as a continuous function interval[0, 1] to X such that f (0) f= from the close df (1). A contin- uous family[0,1]2 to X such thatof loops is a continuous function F(t, 0) = F(t, 1) for every F tfrom;
the idea is that for eachf (s) to be F(t, s), and if we do this then the loopstwe can define a loopft by takingf “vary continuously” with can be continuously shrunk to a point: more formally, t t. A loop f is contractible if itt there should be a continuous family of loops with F(0, s) = f (s) for every s and with all values of F(t, s)F(said to be1, s) equal. If all loops are contractible, then simply connected .
For instance, a sphere is X is simply connected, but a torus is not because there are loops that “go around” the torus and therefore can not be contracted (since any continuous deformation of a loop that goes around the torus goes around the same number of times). Given any sufficiently nice path-connected space (that is, a space the property that any two points in X such as a manifold X are linked by a[I.3 §6.9](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions), with continuous path), we can define a closely related connected space ̃X as follows.
First, we pick an arbitrary simply “base point”tinuous pathsx0 f infrom X. We then take the set of all con-[0,1] to X such that f (0) = x (but we do not necessarily ask forwe regard two of these pathsf andf (1)gto beas equivalentx0). Next$, {}^{0}$, or homotopic, iff (1) = g(1) and there is a continu- ous family of paths that begins withf and ends with g and always has the same beginning point and endpoint. That is, f and g are homotopic if there is a continuous function F(t, 1) =Ff (from1) =[0 g(,11])2 for every to X such thatt, and F(t, F(00, s)) = =x0 f (s)and and universal cover$F(1$, s) =
g(s)X ̃ offor every X to be the space of all homo top ys. Finally, we define the classes of paths: that is, it is thethe space of all continuous paths that start atquotient [I.3 §3.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) ofx by the equivalence relation [I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar) of homotopy. 309 earlier, the torus is not simply connected, so what isits universal cover? To answer this question, it helps to Let us see how this works in practice. As mentioned think of the torus in a slightly artificial way:
fix a pointx0 and define the torus to be the set of all continuous paths that begin atas equivalent if they have the same endpoint. If we do x0, with two of these paths regarded this, then for each path “all we care about” is where it ends, and the set of endpoints is clearly the torus itself. But this was not the definition of the universal cover. There we cared not just about the endpoint ofa path but also about how we reached the endpoint.
For instance, if the path happens to be a loop, in which case the endpoint ismany times that loop goes around the torus, and inx0 itself, then we care about how what manner it goes around. The torus can be defined as the quotient of R2 by the equivalence relation where we define two points as equivalent if their difference belongs to Z2. Then any point in R2 maps to a point in the torus (by the quotient map). Any continuous path on the torus then“lifts” uniquely to the plane in the following sense. Fix a pointu0 in R2 that maps to x0 in the torus.
Then if you trace out any continuous path in the torus that starts at$x^{0}$, there will be exactly one way of tracing out a path in R2 such that each point in that path maps to the appropriate point in the path in the torus. Now suppose that we have two paths in the torus that start atthe “lifts” of those paths both start atx0 and end at the same pointu0, but all wex1. Then know about their endpoints is that they arewe do not know that they are the same. Indeed, if the equivalent:
first path is a contractible loop and the second is a loop that goes once around the torus, then their lifts will end at different points. It turns out (and if you try to visualize this then you will see that the result is very natural and plausible) that the “lifts” of two paths will end at the same point if and only if the original paths are homotopic. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between homotopy classes of paths in the torus and points in R2. This shows that R2 is the universal cover of the torus.
In a sense, the operationof passing from a space to its universal cover “unfolds” the quotienting operation that we use to get from the universal cover to the space. about the natural This associates with each element A fruitful way to think of this example is to think group action [IV.9 §2](/part-04/representation-theory) of(m$, n) of Z2 Zon2 the R2$. translation the torus as the quotient of(x, y) \to  (x +m, y Z2 by this action. That is, the+n).
We can then regard 310 elements of the torus are theare sets of the form{(x + m, yor bits+of the action (whichn):}(m$, n) \in Z2)$ with the quotient topology (which basically means that two translates of Z2 are close when you think they are close). The action of means that each nonzero element of Z2 on R2 is free and Z2 discrete moves a small, which neighborhood of each point entirely off itself. It turns out that every sufficiently nice space quotient of its universal cover by a similar group action:

That is, F takes functions u to real numbers F(u).
Ifall admissible functionsu0 is a minimizer of Fu(that is,), then we can expect that F(u0) ⩽ F(u) for “the derivative ofhas to be made precise, which one might expect to be Fat u0 is zero.” Of course, this idea tricky since the space of admissible functions is infinite dimensional. But in practice these so-called variational methods end up using just standard calculus, and they provide deep insights into the nature of minimizing functions u0. 2 One-Dimensional Problems The simplest situation to which variational techniques apply involves functions of a single variable.
Let us see why minimizers of appropriate functionals in this set-ting must automatically satisfy certain ordinary differential equations.

2.1 Shortest Distance

As a warmup problem, we shall show that the shortest path between two points in the plane is a line segment. Of course, this is obvious, but the methods we develop can be applied to much more interesting situations. Suppose, then, that we are given two points P and Q in the plane. We take as our class of admissible functions all smooth, real-valued functionson some interval I = [a, b], such that u(a)u, defined = P andu(b) = Q. The length of this curve is F[u] = (1 + (u^ )2()1()/){2} dx, (1)I whereu = u(x)and a prime denotes differentiation with respect tocurveu minimizes the length.
We want to deduce thatx. Now suppose that some particular the graph of“setting the derivative of0 u0 is a line segment, which we will do by Fto zero” at the minimizer u0 To make sense of this idea, select any other smooth. function vanishes at its endpoints.

Since the graph of the functionu gives theu0 + tw minimum length, it follows that the functionis just an ordinary function from R to R, has a minimum0 f , which III.94. Variational Methods att = 0.
Therefore, (df /dt)(0) = 0. But we can explic- itly compute integral sign and then integrating by parts. This gives(df /dt)(0)by differentiating under the This identity holds for all functions ties specified above, and consequently I (1 + u(u0 w0)2()1()/){2} dx = −I (1 + (uw(u0)0 with the proper-)2()1()/){2}^ w dx.(1 + (u(u0)0)2()1()/){2}^ = (1 + (u(u0)0)2()3()/){2} = 0 (2) every where on the interval To summarize the discussion so far: if the graph I. of points, thenu0 minimizes the distance between the given end - u^ identically equals zero, and therefore the shortest path is a line segment.
This conclusion may not seem too exciting, but even this simple case0 has an interesting feature. The calculus of variations automatically focuses our attention on the expression$uκ = (1 + (u)2()3()/){2}$,

which turns out to be theu. The graph of the minimizercurvatureu0 has zero curvatureof the graph of every where.

2.2 Generalization: The Euler–Lagrange Equations It turns out that the technique we used for the previ-ous example is extremely powerful and can be vastly generalized. One useful extension is to replace the length functional (1) by a more general functional of the form F[u] = L(u^$, u, x) dx, (3)I where$ L = L(v, z, x) is a given function, some times called thethe “energy” (or “action”) of a given function Lagrangian. Then F[u] can be interpreted asudefined on the interval Suppose next that a particular curve I. u0 is a min- imizer of ditions.
We want to extract information about the$F$, subject to certain fixed boundary con behavior of$u0$, and to do so we proceed as in our first example. We select a smooth function definef (t) = F[u + tw], observe thatw as above, f has a minimum at(df /dt)(0) = t0. As in the previous calculation, we then= 0, and consequently deduce that0 explicitly compute this derivative: d$f$ d$t (0) = I L^{v} w + L^{z}w dx = I(-(L^{v}) + L^{z})w dx$. Here, and∂L/∂z Lv and, evaluated at Lz stand for the partial derivatives(u^  , u , x).

The key point is that any min- u0 is called the imizer of our functional differential equation, which often contains important F must be a solution of this geometrical or physical information. For example, take L(v$, z, x) = {}^{1} mv^{2} - W (z)$, which we interpret as the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy2 W of a particle of mass equation (4) is thenmmoving along the real line.

We can generalize further, by taking

where now we are taking vector-valued functions map the interval I into Rm. If u is a minimizer inu that some appropriate class of functions, then one can com-pute the Euler–Lagrange equation using ideas similar to0 those discussed above. We obtain the equations $-((Lv)k(u0$, u0, x))^ + (Lz)k (u0, u0$, x) = 0$, (6) one for each derivatives ofk L. Here with respect to the(Lv)k and (Lz)k represent the partial kth variables of u^ anda syst emu, evaluated atof coupled ordinary differential equations for(u0$, u0$, x).

3.1 Least Area

A first example extends our earlier examination ofshortest curves. For this problem we are given a region U in the plane, with boundary . artial U , and a real-valued function a class of admissible real-valued functions gdef in ed on the boundary. We then look at u, defined on U, with the condition that u should equal g on the boundary. We can think of the graph of dimensional curved surface with a boundary equal tou as a two- the graph ofg. The area of this surface is F[u] =U(1 + |∇u|2()1()/){2} dx.
(7) Let us assume that a particular function the area among all other surfaces with the given bound- u0 minimizes ary. What can we deduce about the geometric behaviorof this so-called minimal surface? Yet again we proceed by writing$f (t) = F[u^{0} + tw]$, differentiating with respect to calculation we eventually discover thatt, and so on. After some$div$(1 + |∇. abla u(u0)0|2)1^/2 = 0 (8) within the region operator. This nonlinear PDE is the$U$, where “div” denotes the divergence minimal surface equation.

3.2 Generalization: The Euler–Lagrange Equations It is now straightforward, and some times very prof-itable, to replace the area functional (7) by the general expression

F[u] =U L(. abla u, u, x) dx, (9)

in which we now take U to be a region in Rn. Assum- ing thatu0 is a minimizer, subject to given boundary conditions, we deduce the Euler–Lagrange equation - div(. ablav L(. abla u0, u0, x)) + Lz(. abla u0, u0$, x) = 0$. (10) This is a nonlinear PDE that a minimizer must satisfy. A given PDE is called variational if it has this form. the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation is the If, for example, we take L(v$, z, x) = {}^{12}|v |^{2} + G(z)non-,$ linear Poisson equation

And indeed, variational, can be when applied to the right ge om et principles and methods appear in several branches of both mathematics and physics. Many of the objects that mathematicians consider most important have an underlying variational principle of some kind.
The list is impressive and, be sides the examples we have discussed, includes Hamilton’s equations, the Yang Mills and Selberg–Witten equations, various nonlinear wave equations, Gibbs states in statistical physics, and dynamic programming equations from optimal control theory. Many issues remain. For example, if$f = f (t) \text{has a}$ local minimum at a point that(df /dt)(t ) = 0, but also thatt0, then we know not only(d2 f /dt2)(t ) ⩾ 0.

III.95 Varieties Two simple examples of varieties are the circle and the parabola, which can be defined by the polynomial equations$x2 + y2 = 1 and y = x2$, respectively. With one qualification, a variety is the solution set ofa system of polynomial equations. The qualification is that there are certain examples that we do not want to include.
For instance, the set of solutions to the equationx2 - y2 = 0 is the union of the two lines x = y$and$ x = −y, which naturally splits into two pieces. So the solution set to a system of polynomial equationsis called an algebraic set, and it is called a variety if it cannot be written as a union of smaller algebraic sets. Reties can live in2 The examples just given were subsets of the plane. However, the concept is much more general: vari-Rn for any n, and also in Cn for any n.

to encode it pixel by pixel: 0 for black and 1 for white. However, for certain pictures this would obviously be extremely inefficient. For instance, if the picture is a square, the left half of which is entirely white and the right half of which is entirely black, then it is clearly much better to send a set of instructions for recon-struc ting the picture than a list of every single pixel. Further more, the precise details of the pixels usually donot matter:

Of course, for this to be the case it is vital that the operations allowed by the ZF axioms do indeed allow one to perform all of the usual mathematical constructions. Some of the axioms are rather subtle as a result. The other way to view the ZF axioms is as giving us just what we need to “build up” the world of all sets, starting with just the empty set.
One can look at the various ZF axioms and see that each one plays an essen-tial role as we create the set-theoretic universe. Equivalently, they are “closure rules” that any universe ofsets, or more precisely any model of set theory, should obey. So, for example, there is an axiom that says that every set has a power set (the set of all its subsets), and this axiom allows us to build up a huge collection ofsets starting with just the empty set: one obtains the power set of the empty set, the power set of the power set of the empty set, and so on.
Indeed, the universeof all sets could (in a sense) be described as the closure of the empty set under all the allowable operations of ZF. order logic variables (which are interpreted as ranging over all The ZF axioms are written in the language of[IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory). So each axiom can mention first sets), as well as the usual logical operations, and also one “primitive relation,” namely membership. For example, the pair-set axiom above would be formally written as $(∀x)(∀y)(∃z)(∀t)(t \in z ⇐⇒ t = x or t = y)$.

gives the solutions (usually two) to the general quad-ratic polynomial equation a X22 a + b X + c = 0 as a rational expression of the number known as the discriminant of the polynomial$\sqrt{D}$, where D = ba X^2 -^2+4 acb Xis+c, or, equivalently, of the corresponding homogeneous[III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) a X^2 + b XY + c Y^2. This for- quadratic form mul a introduces many irrational numbers: Plato’s dialogue “Theaetetus” has the young Theaetetus credited with the discovery that. qrt{D} is irrational whenever D is a natural number that is not a perfect square.
The curi-ous switch, from initially perceiving an obstruction to a problem to eventually embodying this obstruction as acan effectively study, is repeated over and over again, number or an algebraic object of some sort that we in different contexts, through out mathematics. Much later, complex quadratic irrationalities also made their appearance. Again these were not at first regarded as“numbers as such,” but rather as obstructions to the

solution of problems. Nicholas Chuquet, for example, in his 1484 manuscript, Le Triparty, raised the question of whether or not there is a number whose triple is four plus its square and he comes to the conclusion that there is no such number because the quad-ratic formula applied to this problem yields “impossible” numbers, i.e., complex quadratic irrationalities inour terminology.2 is a discussion along similar lines to the ones wehave just given (expressions (1)–(5) for For any real quadratic (“integral”) irrationality there$\sqrt{2} \text{and expres}-$ sions (6)–(10) forities, there is
also such a theory, but with interest-12$(1 + \sqrt{5}))$. For complex irrational- ing twists. For one thing, we do not have anything directly comparable to continued-fraction expansions for a complex quadratic irrationality. In fact, the simple, but true, answer to the problem of how to find aninfinite number of rational numbers that converge to such an irrationality is that you cannot! Correspond-ingly, the analogue of the Pell equation has only finitely many solutions.
As a consolation, however, the appro-priate “analytic formula” has a simpler sum, as we will see below. Letd be any square-free integer, positive or negative. Associated withτ, defined as follows. Ifd is a particularly important numberd is congruent to 1 mod 4 (that is, ifotherwise, d d - 1 is a multiple of 4), thenτ = . qrt{d}. We will refer to these quadraticτd = 1 2(1 + . qrt{d}); irrational it i esd τd as fundamental algebraic integers of degree is defined in section 11. An algebraic integer of degree2.
The general notion of an “algebraic integer” two is simply a root of a quadratic polynomial of the form X2 + a X + b with a, b ordinary integers. In the first case (when polynomial$X^{2} - dX ≡+ 1 modulo 4)$,^1(1 - d) and in the second it isτ^d is a root of the a root of X2 - d. The reason special names are given4 to these quadratic irrationalities is that algebraic integer is a linear combination (with ordi-any quadratic nary integers as coefficients) of 1 and one of these fundamental quadratic algebraic integers.
4 Rings and Fields I think that one of the big early advances in mathe-matics is the now-current, universal recognition of the importance of studying the properties of collections of square roots, of positive or of negative numbers, as “deaf” (reminis-cent of the word2. bombelli [VI.8](/part-06/rafael-bombelli-1526after), in the sixteenth century, would refer to irrational surd that is still in use) and as “numbers impossible to name.”

mathematical objects, and not just the objects in iso-lation. A ring R of complex numbers is a collection of them that contains 1 and is closed under the opera-tions of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. That is, ifa, b are any two numbers in R, a± b and ab must also be in R. If such a ring R has the further property that it is closed under division by nonzero elements(i.e., ifa/b is again in R whenever a and b are, andb = 0), then we say that R is afield.
(These concepts are discussed further in ideals, and modules [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules).) The ring fields [I.3 §2.2](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) and Z of ordinary rings, integers,\\\{0, ±1, ±2, . . . \\. is our “founding example” of a ring; visibly, it is the smallest ring of complex numbers. The collection of all real or complex numbers that are integral linear combinations of 1 and addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and is there-τd is closed under fore a ring, which we denote byset of all numbers of the forma R + dbτ.
That is, where Rad andis theb are ordinary integers. These rings Rdare our first, basic,$d$ examples oftotype, Z, and they are the most important rings that rings of algebraic integers beyond that proare receptacles for quadratic irrationalities. Every quad-ratic irrational algebraic integer is contained in exactly one For example, when$R^{d}$. d = −1 the corresponding ring Rconsists of the set of complex numbers whose real and-1, usually referred to as the ring of Gaussian integers, imaginary parts are ordinary integers.

The fundamental fact that any ordinary integer greater than 1 can beuniquely expressed as a product of (positive) prime numbers (that is, that Z enjoys the unique factorization property) is crucial for much of the number theory done with ordinary integers.
That this unique factoriza-tion property for integers actually required proof was itself a hard-won realization of Gauss, who also pro-vided its proof (see the fundamental theorem of arithmetic [V.14](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic)). the ring It is easy to see that there are only four units in R-1 of Gaussian integers, namely ±1 and ±i;

multiplication by any of these units effects aof the infinite square tiling (figure 2 above). There are symmetry only six units in the ring and$±^{1}(1 - \sqrt{-3})$; multiplication by any of these units$R^{-3}$, namely ±1, ±1 2(1 + . qrt{-3}) results in a symmetry of the infinite triangular tiling illustrated in figure 3.2 Fundamental to understanding the arithmetic of$R$ is the following question: which ordinary prime num-bersp are irreducible elements of R and which onesd factorize as products of irreducible elements inwill see shortly that if a prime number does factorize$d R^{d}$?
We in$R^{d}$, it must be expressible as the product of pre- cisely two irreducible factors. For example, in the ringof Gaussian integers,$R^{-}1$, we have the factorizations$2$= (1 + i)(1 - i),$5$= (1 + 2 i)(1 - 2 i),$13$= (2 + 3 i)(2 - 3 i),$17$= (1 + 4 i)(1 - 4 i),$29$= (2 + 5 i)(2 - 5 i), .. . where all the Gaussian integer factors in brackets above are irreducible elements of the ring of Gaussian integers. Let us say that an odd primep splits in R-1 if it factorizes into a product of at least two primes and remains prime if it does not do so.
As we shall soon see, the officially agreed-upon definitions of splitting and remaining prime for more general rings of algebraic integers (even ones of the form slightly, but very significantly, differently from the way Rd) are worded we have just defined these concepts in the ringof Gaussian integers. (Note that we have excluded the$R^{-1}$ primep = 2 from the above dichotomy. This is because 2 section 7 below.) In any event, there is an elementary ramifies in$R^{-1}$;

In general, an elementary computable rule that says which primes split and which do not in a ring of algebraic integers such as R is referred to as a splitting law for the ring of algebraic integers in question.$d$ 5 The Rings Rd of Quadratic Integers There is a very important “symmetry,” or phism [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), defined on the ring$R^{d}$.
It sends automor-. qrt{d} to$319$-ally, for rational numbers. qrt{d}, keeps all ordinary integers fixed, and more gener - u and v, it sends α = u + v . qrt{d} to what we may call its. qrt{algebraic} conjugate α^ = u -vis not necessarily the same as the complex - conjugated. (The word “algebraic” is to remind you that this symmetry of the complex numbers!)You can immediately work out the formulas for this algebraic conjugation operation on the fundamental quadratic irrationalitiesτ:

For example, to workτd^ =1 2(1 - . qrt{d}) = 1 - τd. This symme tr(yd)2 α \to  α^ out the algebraic conjugate of a polynomial expression likeαβ + 2γ2, where α, β, and γ are numbers in R , you just replace each individual number by its algebraic conjugate, obtaining the expression$α β + 2γ2$.d berto be the product The most telling integer quantity attached to a num-α = x+yτd in Rααd is its^ .

This gives us a useful tactic for trying to factorize algebraic num-bers in$R$, and offers criteria for determining whether a number R . In fact, an ele me ntd α in Rd is a unit, and whether it is prime inα \in  R is a unit if and only if N(α)d = αα^  = ±1;
in other words, the units are given$d$ by the integral solutions to the equations

$X^{2} - d Y^{2} = ±1 (11) or$X2 + XY -1 4(d - 1)Y2 = ±1 (12)

following the two cases. Here is the proof of this. Ifα = x+yτ is a unit in R , then its reciprocal, β = 1/α, must also be in Applying the norm to both sides of this equation and$d R^{d}$, and, of course, we haved αβ = 1. using the multiplicative property discussed above, wesee that N(α) and N(β) are reciprocal ordinary inte- gers. Therefore, they are either both equal toboth equal to-1. This shows that (x, y) is a solution+1 or to which ever of equation (11) or (12) is appropriate. Inthe other direction, if$N(α) = αα = ±1$, then the recip- rocal ofunit in Rα.is simply ±α^ .
This is in Rd so α is indeed a sides of equations (11) and (12) (which generalize for-mulas (3) and (9)), play an important role; let us refer These homogeneous quadratic forms, the left-hand$d$

Given such a form, one can use it to define(a, b, c) such that other ones. For example, if we make a small linear change of the variables, replacing X by X - Y and keep- ing which simplifies to Yfixed, then we get$a X2 a(X+ (b--Y )2a)XY2 + b(X+ (c--Y )Yb ++a)Yc(Y2)2$,.
That is, we get a new binary quadratic form whose triplet of coefficients is(a$, b - 2a, c - b + a)$, and which (as can easily be checked) has the same discriminant$D$. We can “reverse” this change by replacing$X$ by X + Y and keeping Yfixed. If we do this reversal and perform the corresponding simplification then we get back our original binary quadratic form. Because of this reversibility, these two quadratic forms take exactly the same set of integer values as X and Yvary: it is therefore reasonable to think of them as More generally, then, one says that two binary quad-equivalent.
ratic forms are equivalent if one can be turned into the other (or minus the other) by any “reversible” linear change of variables with integer coefficients. That is, one chooses integers$r$, s, u, v such that r v - su = ±1,$replacesr X + s Y$, XY^ and= u XY by the linear combinations+ v Y, and simplifies the resulting$X =$ expression to get a new triplet of coefficients. The con-ditionr v - su = ±1 guarantees that by a similar oper- ation we can get back to our original binary quadratic form, and also that the new binary quadratic form hasthe same discriminant D as the old one.
So when we talk of “essentially different” binary quadratic forms of dis-criminant D we mean that we cannot turn one into the other by this kind of change of variables. Here is the surprising obstruction to unique factorization that Gauss discovered. The unique factorization principle is valid inand only if every homogeneous quadratic forma X(Rd)2 +ifb XY + c Y2 with discriminant equal to the fund a men- tal discriminant ofquadratic form of R(Rd)d. is equivalent to the fundamental

Then, using a sequence of carefully chosen linear changes of variables you reduce the size of the coeffi-cie nts a, b, and c until you can go no further. Eventually you should end up with one of the two (in equivalent)quadratic forms that there are with discriminant-$23$: the fundamental form2$X^{2} + XY + 3Y^{2}$. For example, can you see that the X^2 + XY + 6 Y^2, or the form binary quadratic form$X^{2} + 3XY + 8Y^{2} \text{is equivalent}$ to$X^{2} + XY + 6Y^{2}$? that thetual theory.

Now, as we have just discussed, it follows from the general theory that tor ization property. We can also see this directly. For R-23 does not have the unique fac- example,

$τ^{-23} · τ^{-2}3 = 2 · 3$,

and all four of the factors in this equation are irre-duc i ble in$R^{-23}$. To be a faithful companion, I should at this point give at least a hint at what connection there might be between this specific “failure of unique factorization” and the previous discussion. It may become abit clearer in the next paragraph, but the underlying tension in the equationτ-23 · τ-23 = 2 · 3 is that all the factors in our ring are prime:
we are ments in our ring R-23 that could factorize it further.missing any ele- We lack, for example, elements that play the role ofthe greatest common divisor of factors of this equation. The general theory regarding these matters (which weare not entering into here, but see euclid’s algorithm [III.22]) tells us that what is missing is some elementγ inbers R-τ23-23 that is both a linear combination of the num-and 2 (with coefficients in the ring$R^{-23}) and$ also a common divisor ofi.e., such thatτ- /γ and 2τ/γ-23 are both inand 2 in the ring R-.
There is R-23, no such element, for its norm must divide and N(2) = 4, and therefore be equal to 2, which can23 N(τ23-23) = 6 easily be shown to be impossible. But we are interested, rather, in the phenomenon that binary quadratic forms will indeed show this, so let us in equivalence of certain go on. First, check that any linear combination

$α · τ^{-23} + β · 2$

withu·τ α,+βv ·elements of2, where u and R-v23 are ordinary integers. Nowcan also be written as compute the binary quadratic form given by system at-ically taking the norms of these linear combinations,$- {}^{2}3$ and viewing these norms as functions of the integer coefficient su, v: $N(u · τ^{-23} + v · 2) = (τ^{-23u} + 2v)(τ^{-2}3u + 2v)= 6u^{2} + 2uv + 4v^{2}$.

Viewing the U and V to emphasize their status as variables, we canu and the v as variables, and dubbing them say that the norm quadratic form obtained from the collection of linear combinations of$τ^{-23} and 2 is$ 6$U^{2} + 2UV + 4V^{2} = 2 · (3U^{2} + UV + 2V^{2})$.322 mon divisor,γ Now suppose that, contrary to fact, there in the ringγR, as above; in particular, the multiples of- would then be precisely the linear were a com- combinations of the numbers then have another way of describing those linear combi-23$τ^{-23} and 2$. We would nations;
namely, for any pair of ordinary integers there would be a pair of ordinary integers(r , s)(u, v)such that $u · τ^{-23} + v · 2 = γ · (r τ^{-23} + s) = r γτ^{-23} + sγ$. Taking norms, as above, we would get $N(γ · (r τ^{-23} + s)) = N(r γτ^{-23} + sγ)= N(γ)(6r^{2} + r s + s^{2})$.

Again, thinking ofr and s as variables and renaming them quadratic form: R and S we would have the corresponding norm N(γ) · (6 R2 + RS + S2) = 2 · (6 R2 + RS + S2). Given the above facts—dependent, of course, on the contrary-to-fact hypothesis that there is athe key idea is that there would be linear changes ofγas above— variables from establish an equivalence between the two quadratic(U, V ) to (R, S) and back that would$forms 2$· (3 U^2 +UV + 2 V^2) and 2· (6 R^2 +RS +S^2). But these quadratic forms are not equivalent!
Their inequiv-alence therefore shows that the putativeγ does not exist and factorization in the ring$R^{-23} \text{is not unique}$. 7 Class Numbers and the Unique Factorization Property In the previous section we saw that the collection of in equivalent quadratic forms of discriminant equal to the fundamental discriminant provides us with an obstruction to unique factorization. Some what later, a more articulated version of this obstruction arose, known as the implies, to describe this we must use the vocabulary of ideal class group$H^{d} of R^{d}$.
As its name ideals$R^{d} \text{is an}$[III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) and ideal if it has the following closure properties: groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). A subset I of ifbelong toα belongs to I, so does I, so doα +-βα.
(The first and third prop-andτdα, and if α and β erties imply together that any integer combination ofα and β belongs to I.) The basic example of such an ideal is the set of all multiples of some fixed, nonzero elementγ of R , where by a multiple of γ we mean the product of tersely as(γ)γ and an element of, or, slightly more expressively, asd Rd. We denote this setγ · R . An ideal of this sort, i.e., one that can be expressed asthe set of all multiples of a single nonzero elementγ, isd

The unique factorization principle is valid inonly if every ideal in R is principal. Rd if andd

Reflecting on this, you can get a sense of why the word“ideal” might have been chosen. Every principal ideal in(which is uniquely determined apart from multiplica-Rd is of the form γ · Rd for some number γ in Rd tion by units), but some times there are more general ideals. These arise if you ever have two elements of$R$ (think ofthat the set of all their integer combinationsτ-23 and 2, as in the previous section) such can not bed expressed as the set of multiples of some fixed num-ber$γ in R^{d}$.
This phenomenon is a sign that we may be missing numbers inizations to make the arithmetic in$Rd$that provide fine enough factor-R as smooth going as one might hope for. Just as a principal ideald γ · R corresponds to the number eral kind (think of the set of all integer combinationsγ, ideals of this more gen-d of“ideal numbers” that should, “by rights,” be present inτ-23 and 2) can be thought of as corresponding to our ring, but happen not to be. bers it makes some sense to try to multiply them:
if J are two ideals in Once we think of ideals as standing for ideal num-R , we let I · J denote the set of all I, finite sums of productsis in J. The product of two principal idea lsd α · β in which α is in(γ I) and· (γ β) is the principal ideal hope, multiplication of principal ideals corresponds to(γ1 · γ2) so, just as one woul(d1)2 multiplication of the corresponding numbers. Multipli-cation of any ideal I by the ideal (1) leaves Iunchanged: $(1)· I = I$; we therefore refer to the ideal(1) as the unit ideal.
With this new notion of multiplication of ideals we can now give the general definition of what it means fora prime numberp to split or to remain prime in a ring Rd The idea behind the definition is to use multiplication, the definition we promised in section 4. of ideals rather than of numbers. So if we are thinking about a prime attention to the principal ideal$p$, the first thing we do is turn our$(p) in R^{d}$. If this can be factorized as a product of two different ideals (not

necessarily principal ideals, this is the whole point) in R , and if neither of these is the unit ideal (1) = R , then we say thatd p splits in Rd. If, on the other hand, d no factorization of the ideal one of the factors being the ideal(p) can be made with out(1) = R , then we say that important definition: if the principal ideal$p \text{remains prime in} R^{d}$. There is also a third(p)d can be expressed as the square of another ideal I, then we say thatof this definition, we may say that an idea lp ramifies in Rd.
Continuing with the momentum P is a prime ideal ideals neither of which is the unit ideal. This defini-if$P$cannot be “factorized” as the product of two tion makes sense whether or not P is principal, so we are subtly shifting our attention from the multiplicative arithmetic of the numbers in R to the ideals. if when you multiply each by an appropriate principal By definition, two ideals are in the samed ideal class ideal you get the same ideal as a result. This is a nat-ural equivalence relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) on ideals.
It is also one that J are two ideals, then the ideal class of their product respects products, meaning that if I and Iother words, if· J depends only on the ideal classes of I^  is in the same ideal class as I and IJ. (Inand J^  is in the same ideal class as J^ , then I^  · J^  is in the same ideal class as I · J.) We can therefore say what we mean by classes, pick an ideal from each, multiply those, and multiplication of ideal classes: to multiply two take the ideal class of the resulting product.
The set Hd of ideal classes of Rd, given this operation of multi- plication, forms an Abelian group, in the sense that the multiplication law we have just defined is associative and commutative, and there are inverses. The identity element is the principal ideal the ideal class group, directly measures the extent to Rd itself. This group Hd, which the ideals of the ring speaking it is what you get if you take the multiplicative Rdare principal:
roughly structure of all ideals and “divide out” by the principal ones. As was mentioned in section 6, there is a close connection between ideal classes and binary quadratic forms. To begin to see this, take an ideal I of R and write it as the set of all integer combinations of twoelementsα$, β of R^{d}$. Then consider the norm functiond on the elements of$I$, that is$, N(xα + yβ) = (xα + yβ)(xα + yβ)= αα x2 + (αβ + α β)xy + ββ y2$.

This is a binary quadratic form in the variable coefficientsβ that generat ex and y. If you start with a different choice of Iyou get a different form, but the twoα,

forms are scalar multiples of two forms with discrimi-nant D that are equivalent to one another. Even better, the equivalence class of these forms depends only onthe ideal class of I. It can be shown that there are only a finite number of distinct ideal classes of Hdis finite. The number of its elements is denoted$R^{d}$; that is, the ideal class group$h^{d}$ and called theto unique factorization of class number R ofis given by the nontrivial-Rd.

It is a striking lacuna in our theory that, even today, nobody knows how to prove that there are infinitely many values ofd > 0 for which R enjoys the unique factorization property—particularly since we expect$d$ that more than three quarters of them do! Our expec-tat i ons are even more precise than that, thanks to Henri Cohen and Hendrik Lenstra, who make use of certain probabilistic expectations (now known as the Cohen–Lenstra heuristics) to conjecture that the density of positive fundamental discriminants of class num-ber 1 among all positive fundamental discriminants is 0.75446 . . ..
8 The Elliptic Modular Function and the Unique Factorization Property A different obstruction to unique factorization inavailable whend is negative. Now R may be thought Rd is of as a lattice in the complex plane (see figure 3), which makes a wonderful tool available for us: the classical$d$ elliptic modular function of klein [VI.57], $j(z) = e - 2^{π}i z + 744 + 196 884 e2^{π}i z + 21 493 760 e4^{π}i z + 864 299 970 e6^{π}i z + · · ·$.(13) This function, also colloquially referred to as the“$j$-function,” converges for complex numbers$z = x +$ iy with y > 0.
If z = x + iy and z^  = x^  + iy^  are two such complex numbers, thenj(z) = j(z^ ) if and only if the lattice generated bythe same as the lattice generated byz and 1 in the complex plane isz^  and 1 (or, equiv- alently,$z = (az + b)/(cz + d)$, where a, b, c, and d are ordinary integers such that$ad - bc = 1)$.

First, since the ring plex plane is simply the lattice generated by Rd as situated in the com-τ and 1, it follows from the previous paragraph that this valuej(τ ) will be the same if we replace τ by anydelementαentire ring ofd Rd, as long as the lattice generated by R . More importantly, j(τd) is an algebraicα and 1 is the integer of degree roughly comparable with the class dd number ofif and only if the ring$R^{d}$. In particular, it is an ordinary integer R has the unique factorization property.
(This result is one of the great applications of a classical theory known asd complex multiplication.) In brief, here is yet another answer to the question of when the unique factorization principle holds for when dis negative: ifj(τ ) is an ordinary integer, the Rd answer is yes ; otherwise it isd no. for which The search for the full list of negative values of Rd has the unique factorization proper tyd makes a marvelous tale:
there are precisely nine val-ues ofd for which it occurs (see below), but for over two decades number theorists, while knowing these nine, could prove only that there were no more than ten. The history of how the nonexistence of a possible tenth value ofone of the thrilling chapters in our subject. K. Heeg-d was established, and reestablished, is ner, in an article published in 1952, provided what he claimed was a proof of the nonexistence of the possible tenth value of d.
However, Heegner’s proof was framed in some what unfamiliar language and was not under-stood by the mathematicians of the time. His paper and his purported proof were largely forgotten until the late 1960 s, when the nonexistence of the tenth field was established (to the mathematical community’s satisfaction) by Stark (1967) and independently, via a different method, by Baker (1971). It was only then that mathematicians took a second and closer look at Heegner’s original article and discovered that he had indeed proven exactly what he claimed.
More over, his proof offered an elegant direct conceptual road to an understanding of the underlying issue. Here are the nine values of$d$: $d = −1$, -2, -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163. And here are the corresponding nine values of$j(τ^{d})$: $j(τ^{d}) = 2^{6}3^{3}$, 2653, 0, -3353, -215, -21533,- 2183353, -2153353113, -2183353233293. As Stark once pointed out, if, for some of these val-ues of$d$, you simply “plug”τ into the power-series expansion forj, you get rather surprising formulas. Ford

My favorite elementary example of this type is the theorem due tomay be expressed as a sum of two squares, fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665) that if a prime number$p = a^{2} + bp^{2}$ with 0(For example, 1$< a ⩽ b^{2}$, then it has only one such expression.+102 is the only way of expressing the prime number 101 as the sum of two squares.) More-over, a prime numberp can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if4$k +$1. (The “only if” part of this is easy to see:
sincep = 2 or p is of the form any square is congruent either to 0 or to 1 mod 4, anodd integer that is a sum of two squares is necessarily congruent to 1 mod 4.) These statements about ordi-nary integers can be translated into basic statements about the ring of Gaussian integers. For if we write$a2 + b2 = (a + ib)(a - ib)$, with i = . qrt{-1}, then we can viewa2 + b2 as the norm of the (conjugate) elements a ± ib in the ring of Gaussian integers.
So, if p is a prime number that admits an expression as a sum of squares, p = a2 + b2, it follows that each of the ele- mentsa ± ib has norm a prime integer. It is easy to deduce thatian integers. Indeed, any factorization ofa ±ib is itself a prime in the ring of Gauss-a ± ib into a product of two Gaussian integers would have the prop-erty that the norms of the factors are ordinary integers which multiply out to be the prime limits their possibilities: one of them has to be a unit.p, and this severely In other words, whenever$p = a2 + b2$, thenp = (a + ib)(a - ib)

is a factorization of the ordinary integer primep into a product of two Gaussian integer primes. The unique-ness part of Fermat’s theorem then follows from (in

fact, it is readily seen to be equivalent to) the unique factorization property of the ring$R^{-} \text{of Gaussian inte}-$ gers. That any prime number admits such an expression as a sum of two squares$p \text{of the form} 4^{1} k + 1$ follows from theof Gaussian integers: an odd prime number splitting law for prime sp in the ringp is a norm, and hence splits into the product of two dis-tinct primes, in the ring of Gaussian integers if and only ifthe beginning of an immense chapter of arithmetic.p is congruent to 1 mod 4.

An exercise: show that any algebraic number can beexpressed as an algebraic integer divided by an ordinary integer. 12 Presentation of Algebraic Numbers In dealing with any mathematical concept, we confront, in one way or another, the dual problem of the various forms in which it comes to us when it arises in our work, and the various ways we can present it so as to deal with it effectively.
We have already seen a bit ofthis at the outset of this article, in our discussion of quadratic surds, and we will continue to see it in our treatment of them below, where the various modes in which quadratic surds can be presented—as radicals, as eventually recurrent continued fractions metric sums—come together, all contributing to their, or as tr i go no unified theory. This issue of presentation is all the more of a problem with algebraic numbers in general, which may come tous in a multitude of ways.
For example, they can arise as the coordinates of points on specific algebraic varieties whose defining equations may not be easily available, or as special values of functions like theis natural, then, to look for some uniform way of pre - j - function. It sent ing algebraic numbers, and the history of the sub-ject shows how much effort has been devoted to such a search.
For example, consider the focus on iterated radical expressions, as in the famous formula for the solution to the general cubic equation$X3 = b X + c \text{given by}$ X = c2 + c22 - b2(73)1/3 + c2 - c22 - b2(73)1/3, (14) or the corresponding general solution to the fourth-degree equation. These were major achievements of sixteenth-century Italian algebra, and they culminated in

the proof that the general fifth-degree algebraic number could achievement of the early nineteenth century (seenot be so expressed, which was a major the insolubility of the quintic [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic)). The challenge to give algebraic numbers was the source of a classic book bysome analytic expression for such fifth-degree Klein, The Icosahedron, written in the late nineteenth century.
Kronecker wrote that it was the “dream of his youth” (his Jugendtraum) to establish a uniform mode of presentation for a class of algebraic numbers that interested him, by expressing them as values of certain analytic functions. 13 Roots of Unity A central role in the theory of algebraic numbers is played by the tions of the equation roots of unity Xn, that is, the = 1, or equivalently then complex solu - n roots of the polynomial Xn - 1. If we let ζn = e2πi/n, then these roots are preciselyζn and its powers, so in particular they are algebraic integers.
They give us the factorization$Xn - 1 = (X - 1)(X - ζn)(X - ζn 2) · · · (X - ζn n - 1)$. Now the powers ofζn form the vertices of a regular n- gon in the complex plane, centered at the origin. This has the following consequence, noticed by Gauss in his youth. It can be shown that compass and straightedge constructions allow us, in effect, to extract square roots, so wheneverζ can be given as an expression built out of just square roots and the usual arithmeti-$n$ cal operations, we have, implicitly, a ruler-and-compass construction of the regularn-gon, and conversely.
connected with these constructions, consider this. If we To get some idea of why square roots are so closely have given ourselves a unit measure, which we can view as the distance between the numbers 0 and 1 in the(complex) plane, and if we have already constructed, by whatever device, a specific point, and 1 on the horizontal axis of the plane, we can firstx say, between 0 “construct”x/4 by straightedge and compass, and then go on to form a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse of length 1+ x/4 and one of its other sides of length$1$- x/4 (again using a straightedge and compass).
The Pythagorean theorem gives us that the third side ofthat triangle is of length$\sqrt{x}$. If one follows this line of thought (but adapts it to deal with complex quantities as well as the real numberx as in the example we have

just discussed), then one can see that the equations$\sqrt{}ζ3 = \sqrt{}(t1)2(1 + i 3)$,ζ4 = i$,ζ5 = 1 4(\sqrt{5} - 1\sqrt{}) + (i1)8 + 5 + \sqrt{5}$,,ζ6 = −1 2 (1 + i 3)

provide (implicit) constructions of the equilateral triangle, the square, the regular pentagon, and the reg-ular hexagon, respectively. By contrast,ζ7 cannot be expressed solely in terms of the arithmetical operations and square roots (it is the root of a quadratic equation with coefficients that are rational expressions in the roots of the irreducible cubic polynomial$X^{3} - {}^{7}X +$ might fail to be constructible by the standard classi-277 ), which already suggests that the regular heptagon3 cal means—and indeed it does fail with out some act of“angle trisection.” (In principle, though,
the reader can work out an expression forand cube roots by means of the information provided inζ7 in terms of square roots the parenthetical phrase above, together with equation(14).) the regular if Gauss showed that ifn is a Fermat primen-gon is classically constructible if and only, that is, a prime number of then > 2 is a prime number then form 22 a + 1. So, for example, the 11-gon and 13-gon are not constructible by classical means, but since is expressible as nested rational expressions of squareζ17 roots, the 17-gon is, famously, constructible. ated rational expressions of square roots.
However, this inhospitability is not mutual, since all square roots of So, not all roots of unity can be expressed as it er integers can be expressed as integer combinations of roots of unity.

(16) This formula is not too hard to prove, apart from deter-mining which sign is correct in the initial±, but after considerable efforts Gauss managed to work this outtoo.

As for the circular unit$cp$, it is defined to be (p-1)/2(ζp a - ζ-p a)σp(a) = {}(p-1)/2 . in (πa/p)σp(a), and this leads to further formulas. For example, when$p = 5$, we havea=1 ε = τ =1 (1 a+=. qrt1 5)$, \text{and since} h = 1$,$formula (6) for$ p. qrtp= 5 tells us tha(t5()2)5$1$+2 5 = ζζ5 2 -- ζζ5^--1 2 = . in . in 1 5 2ππ . 5 5 5 14 The Degree of an Algebraic Number IfΘ is an algebraic integer that is also a rational num- ber, thenof this fact. IfΘis an “ordinary” integer. Here is the proofΘ is a rational number, then we may writeΘ = C/D as a fraction in lowest terms.
If Θ is also an algebraic integer, then it is the root of a monic polynomial with rational integer coefficients,Θn + a Θn -1 + · · · + a , so we have an equation(C/D()1)n + a1(C/D()n()-1)n+ · · · + (an)-1(C/D) + an = 0. Multiplying through by Dn we get Cn + a1(Cn)-1 D + · · · + (an()-1 CD()n)-1 + an Dn = 0, where all terms are (ordinary) integers, and all but the first one is divisible by D. If D > 1 then it has some prime factor divisible bypp.
Since the terms add up to zero, it follows, so all terms apart from the first are also that$p divides C^{n}$, which implies that p divides C, which contradicts the assertion that the fraction C/D is in its lowest terms. This in turn contradicts the hypothesis thatΘ can be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers in the first place. As the reader may like to verify, this fact implies the result attributed to Theaetetus above, that. qrt{A} is irrational if and only if A is not a perfect square.

15 Algebraic Numbers as Ciphers determined by Their Minimal Polynomials We have expressly insisted that our algebraic numbers are complex numbers (of a certain sort). But another possible attitude toward an algebraic number, attitude at times promoted by Kronecker, among oth-Θ, an ers, is to deal with algebraic relations implied by the fact that it is a rootΘ as an unknown satisfying only the of its (unique monic) minimal polynomial with rational coefficients.

If ΘΘis an algebraic number of degree satisfies; these roots are called con-n, thenΘ has n distinct conjugates, all of them again, of course, algebraic numbers.
16 A Few Remarks about the Theory of Polynomials Central to the theory of polynomials in one variable—and, therefore, particularly to the theory of algebraic numbers—is the general relationship thatto coefficients: roots have n (X - T ) = Xn +n (-1)j A (T, T , . . . , T )(Xn)-j.i = 1 i j = 1 j 1 2 n The polynomial deg reej (this means that every monomial in it has total Aj(T1, T2, . . . , Tn) is homogeneous of degree j), has integer coefficients, and is symmetric in (i.e., unchanged by any permutation of) the variables T , T , . . . , T .

The coefficient of $A1(T1$, T2, . . . , Tn) = T1 + T2 + · · · + Tn, and this is the trace form. polynomials in the list. For Whenn = 2 the norm and trace are all the symmetricn = 3, beyond the norm and trace we also have the symmetric polynomial of degree two: $A2(T1$, T2$, T3) = T1T2 + T2T3 + T3T1 = 1 2{(T1 + T2 + T3)2 - ((T1)2 + (T2)2 + (T3)2)}$.
It is of major importance to this theory, and more specifically totry properties of the conjugate roots are nicely reflected galois theory [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic), that the symme in these symmetric polynomials. In particular, we have the fundamental result that any symmetric polynomial in$T^{1}$, T2, . . . , Tnwith rational coefficients can be expressed as a polynomial with rational coefficients in

For example, the equa-Aj(T1, T2, . . . , Tn), and sim- tion above shows that(T1)2 + (T2)2 + (T3)2 can be expressed as $A^{1}(T^{1}$, T2$, T3)2 - 2A2(T1$, T2$, T3)$. 17 Fields of Algebraic Numbers and Rings of Algebraic Integers The inverse of a nonzero algebraic number is again analgebraic number; the sum, difference, and product of two algebraic numbers are algebraic numbers; the sum, difference, and product of two algebraic integers are algebraic integers.
The neat proofs of these (latter) facts are a good demonstration of the power of linear algebra, and in particular ofany matrix with integer coefficients (and therefore also Cramer’s rule. This states that any linear transformation of a finite-dimensional vector space that preserves an integer lattice) satisfies amonic polynomial identity with integer coefficients.

If, however, you are familiar with linear algebra, then a less painful route is to form the four-dimensional vector space over the rational num-bers, generated by 1,$\sqrt{2}$, . qrt{3}, and . qrt{6} (which are linearly independent when the scalars are rational). Multiplica-tion by. qrt{2} + . qrt3 defines a linear transformation T of this vector space, and one can compute its character-istic polynomial P . The Cayley–Hamilton theorem says that that. qrt{P} (T )2 + . qrt=3 is a root of0, and this translates into the statement P .

For one thing, there is a nat- of ratic fields, and the prime divisors splitting and ramification that we discussed for quad-p of D(K) are pre- cisely those prime numbers that ramify in the field extension absolute value of the discriminant K. By a theorem of minkowski D(K) of a number[VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909), the field K of degree n is always greater thanπ4 n · nnn! 2.

This is greater than 1 unless numbers. It follows that any nontrivial extension of the Kis the field of rational field of rational numbers has some prime that ramifiesin it, a result that would be very hard to prove with out the help of the algebraic structures we have just defined. This integer D(K) really is quite a discrimi- nating “tag” for our number field of hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901), given any integer K, for, by a theorem D there are only finitely many different number fields with discriminant equal totrue for quadratic number fields, the integers$D$.
(Not all integers can be discriminants: as is D that are discriminants are either divisible by 4 or else congruentto 1 modulo 4.) 18 On the Size(s) of the Absolute Values of All Conjugates of an Algebraic Integer As we have just seen, the coefficients of the minimal polynomial for an algebraic integerΘ are given by the ordinary integers bersΘ are all the conjugates ofaj(Θ1, Θ2, . . . , ΘΘ. The sizes of all thesen), where the num-i

coefficients must therefore all be less than some univer-sal number M that depends only on the degree of Θ and the largest absolute value of any of its conjugates. Asa consequence, given anyn and any positive number Bdegree less than, there are only finitely many algebraic integersn such that the absolute values ofΘ ofΘ and its conjugates are all less than for anyn and Mthere are only finitely many polyno-B.
(This is because mials of degree less than or equal ton with the absolute values of all their integer coefficients at most finiteness result is the key to the following observation, M.) This due to Kronecker: ifthe absolute values ofΘΘis an algebraic number and ifand of all of its conjugates are equal to 1, thenΘ is a root of unity. Indeed, all the pow- ers ofthe same property: their absolute value, and that of allΘ have degree at most that of Θ, and they enjoy

their conjugates, is equal to 1. Consequently, there are only finitely many such algebraic numbers, from which it follows that there must be at least one coincidence of the formΘ^a = Θ^bfor differenta and b. But this can happen only ifΘ is a root of unity. 19 Weil Numbers To follow this thread for just a bit, let us generalize the hypothesis of Kronecker’s observation, and define a Weil number3 of absolute valuer to be a nonzero algebraic integer such that it and all of its conjugates have the same absolute value the previous section there are only finitely many dis-r .
By the discussion in tinct Weil numbers of given degree and absolute value. By Kronecker’s theorem, which we have just described, the Weil numbers of absolute value 1 are precisely the roots of unity. Here are further basic facts that you might try to prove. First, the quadratic Weil numbersω are precisely those quadratic algebraic integers such that$|trace(ω)| ⩽ 2 |N(ω)| = 2 |ωω |$, where ω^ is the (algebraic) conjugate ofthen a quadratic Weil numberωω.
Second, ifof absolute valuep is prime. qrt{p} is a prime element of the (unique) ring of quadratic inte-gers R that contains ω, and therefore gives a prime factorization Weil numbers of absolute valued ωω^  = ±p of the integerpν/p2 in that ring., where p is again a prime number and extremely important in arithmetic: they hold the keyν is a natural number, are to counting numbers of rational solutions of systems of polynomial equations over finite fields.
For just one concrete example, the Gaussian integer$ω = −1 + \text{i and}$ its algebraic conjugate (which, in this instance, is also its complex conjugate)  ̄ω = −1 - i are Weil numbers (of absolute value 2) that control the number of solutionsof the equation$y^{2} - y = x^{3} - x$over all finite fields of size a power of 2. Specifically, the number of solutionsof that equation over a field of order 2ν is given by the$formula 2$ν - (-1 - i)^ν - (-1 + i)^ν (which is an ordinary integer). This leads to another immense chapter of mathematics.

This study continues with great intensity, since these galois groups and their linear representations hold the key to a very detailed understanding of number fields.
Inits modern dress, algebraic number theory is closely connected with what is often called arithmetic geometry trol of a wealth of algebraic number theoretic material[IV.5](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry). Kronecker’s dream of getting explicit conby expressing algebraic numbers in terms of natural analytic functions has not yet been fully realized. Nevertheless, the scope of this dream (and, one might also add, the supply of natural analytic and algebraic functions) has expanded substantially:
the full range of algebraic geometry and group representation theory is now being brought to bear on it.
This is done, for example, by the works with objects known as Langlands program, which among other things Shimura varieties. On the one hand, these varieties have close connections with the theory of group representations and classical algebraic geometry, which greatly helps us to understand them. On the other hand, they are a rich source of con-crete linear representations of Galois groups of number fields. This program, one of the glories of current math - ematics, will, I expect, make a terrific chapter for a Companion to mathematics the next century.

IV.2 Analytic Number Theory Andrew Granville 1 Introduction What is number theory? One might have thought that it was simply the study of numbers, but that is too broada definition, since numbers are almost ubiquitous in mathematics. To see what distinguishes number theory from the rest of mathematics, let us look at the equationx2 + y2 = 15 925, and consider whether it has any solutions. One answer is that it certainly does: indeed, the solution set forms a circle of radius$\sqrt{15} 925 \text{in the}$ plane.
However, a number theorist is interested in integer any such solutions exist.solutions, and now it is much less obvious whether is to notice that 15 925 is a multiple of 25: in fact, it is A useful first step in considering the above question IV. Branches of Mathematics 25 posed further: it is 49 . imes 637. Further more, the number 637 can be decom-. imes 13. That is, 15 925 = 52 . imes 72 . imes 13. This information helps us a lot, because if we can find integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = 13, then we can multiply them by 5 to the original equation.
Now we notice that . imes 7 = 35 and we will have a solution a = 2 andb = 3 works, since 22 + 32 = 13. Multiplying these num- bers by 35, we obtain the solution 702$+ 1052 = 15 925$ to the original equation. As this simple example shows, it is often useful to decompose positive integers multiplicative ly into com-pone nts that cannot be broken down any further.
These components are called prime numbers, and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic every positive integer can be written as a product of[V.14](/part - 05/the - fundamental - theorem - of - arithmetic) states that primes in exactly one way. That is, there is a one - to - one correspondence between positive integers and finite products of primes. In many situations we know what we need to know about a positive integer once we have decomposed it into its prime factors and understood those, just as we can understand a lot about moleculesby studying the atoms of which they are composed.
For example, it is known that the equation$x2 + y2 = n has$ an integer solution if and only if every prime of the form4 m + 3 occurs an even number of times in the prime fac- tor ization ofno integer solutions to the equationn. (This tells us, for instance, that there arex2 + y2 = 13 475, since 13 475= 52 . imes 72 . imes 11, and 11 appears an odd number of times in this product.)Once one begins the process of determining which integers are primes and which are not, it is soon appar-ent that there are many primes.
However, as one goes further and further, the primes seem to consist of a smaller and smaller proportion of the positive integers. They also seem to come in a some what irregular pat - tern, which raises the question of whether there is any formula that describes all of them. Failing that, can one perhaps describe a large class of them? We can also ask whether there are infinitely many primes. If there are, can we quickly determine how many there are up to a given point? Or at least give a good estimate for this number?
Finally, when one has spent long enough looking for primes, one cannot help but ask whether there is a quick way of recognizing them. This last question isdiscussed in computational number theory [IV.3](/part - 04/computational - number - theory); the rest motivate the present article. Now that we have discussed what marks number theory out from the rest of mathematics, we are ready to make a further distinction: between analytic number theory. The main difference is that algebraic and IV.2.
Analytic Number Theory in algebraic number theory (which is the main topic of algebraic numbers [IV.1](/part - 04/number - theory)) one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formu - las, where as in analytic number theory, the topic of this article, one looks for sort of quantity that one estimates in analytic num - good approximations. For the ber theory, one does not expect an exact formula to exist, except perhaps one of a rather artificial and unilluminating kind. One of the best examples of such a quantity is one we shall discuss in detail:
the number of primes less than or equal tox. terminology that allows us to give some idea of the quality of an approximation. Suppose, for example, that Since we are discussing approximations, we will need we have a rather erratic functions how that, oncex is large enough, f (x)f (x)but are able tois never big- ger than 25 the functionx2 g(x). This is useful because we understand = x2 quite well. In general, if we can find a constant everyx, then we write cf (x)such that = O(g(x))|f (x).
A typical usage| ⩽ cg(x) for occurs in the sentence “the average number of prime factors of an integer up tox is log log x + O(1)”; in other words, there exists some constant that|the average - log log x| ⩽ c once xis sufficient lyc > 0 such large. We write$f (x) ∼ g(x) \text{if lim} f (x)/g(x) =$1;
and also that is, when we want to say thatf (x). pprox  g(x) when we are being a little less precise, x →$\infty$ f (x) and g(x) come close whendo not want to be, more specific about what we meanxis sufficiently large, but we cannot be, or by “come close.” andthe symbol what terms the sum, or product, is to be It is convenient for us to use the notationfor product. Typically we will indicate beneath for sums taken over. For example, integersm that are greater than or equal to 2, wherea(sm()⩾){2} will be a sum over all will be a product over all primes p.pprime

Then each2 xk must contain at least one prim(ek)+1 1 2 k factor, since ifqk <k say, and these prime factors must be distinct,, then q divides x which divides x - 1, while of primes.q divides x.
This gives us an infinite sequence$k^{k}$ ferent proof that there are infinitely many primes, one that turned out to be highly influential in what was In the eighteenth century euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) gave a difto come later. Suppose again that the list of primesisp , p , . . . , p . As we have mentioned, the funda- mental theorem of arithmetic implies that there is a1 2$k$ one-to-one correspondence between the set of all inte-gers and the set of products of the primes, which, if those are the only primes, is the set$a$, a , . . . , a ⩾ 0.
But, as Euler observed, this implies{(pa()1)1(pa()2)2 · · · (pa()k)k}: that a sum involving the elements of the first set should equal the analogous sum involving the elements of the1 2$k$ second set:

n1 sna positive intege(rn()⩾){1} = a \su(m1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{}$,\\(a2)\\\{,\\\}$...,(ak)⩾10 (p\su(m1()a)1 (p2()a)2 · · · p(1 a()k)k)s . um  1=a ⩾ 0 ((p1()a)1()s()a()⩾){0} ((pa()2)2)s · · ·a ⩾ 0 ((pa()k)k)s=j=k 1 1 1 - p(1 j()s)-1$.2 k$

The last equality holds because each sum in the second-last line is the sum of a geometric progression. Euler then noted that if we takes = 1, the right - hand side equals some rational number (since each$p > 1)j$

where as the left-hand side equals. nfty . This is a contra- diction, so there cannot be finitely many primes. (To seewhy the left-hand side is infinite whens = 1, note that(ing, and therefore1/n) ⩾n n+1(1/t) dt Nsince the function 1-1(1/n) ⩾N (1/t)/tdis decreas-t = . og N which tends to During the proof above, we gave a formula for$\infty\text{asNn}=→$. nfty$1$.)1 n-s under the false assumption that there are only finitely many primes. To correct it, all we have to do is rewrite it in the obvious way with out that assumption: na positive intege(rn()⩾){1} n1 s =p prime 1 - p(1 s)-1. (1)

Now, however, we need to be a little careful about whether the two sides of the formula converge. It is safe to write down such a formula when both sides are absolutely convergent, and this is true whens > 1. (An infinite sum or product is absolutely convergent if the value does not change when we take the terms in any order we want.) pens to (1) when are equal when Like Euler, we want to be able to interpret what hap-s >s =1, the natural thing to do is con-1.

Taking logarithms and discarding negligible terms, wethen find that

So how numerous are the primes? One way to get anidea is to determine the behavior of the sum analogous to (3) for other sequences of integers. For instance,1/n2 converges, so the primes are, in this sense, more numerous than the squares. This argument works(n⩾)1 if we replace the power 2 by anywe have just observed, the sums > 1, since then, as1/ns is about$1$/(s -1/n(1) and in particular converges.
In fact, since. og n)2 converges, we see that the prime(sn()⩾){1} are in the same sense more numerous than the num-bers(n⩾)1{n(. og n)2}:$n ⩾ 1$, and hence there are infinitely many integers than or equal toxxfor which the number of primes lessis at least x/(. og x)2. Thus, there seem to be primes in abundance, but we would also like to verify our observations, made from calculations, that the primes constitute a smaller and smaller proportion of the integers as the integers become larger and larger.
The easiest way to see this is to try to count the primes using the “sieve of Eratosthenes.” In the sieve of Eratosthenes one starts with allthe positive integers up to some numberx. From these, one deletes the numbers 4, 6, 8 and so on—that is, all multiples of 2 apart from 2 itself. One then takes the first undeleted integer greater than 2, which is 3, and deletes all its multiples—again, not including the number 3 itself. Then one removes all multiples of 5 apart

IV. Branches of Mathematics

from 5, and so on. By the end of this process, one is left with the primes up tox. After deleting every second integer up to This suggests a way to guess at how many there are.x other than 2 (which we call “sieving by 2”) one is left with roughly half the integers up to$x$; after sieving by 3, one is left with roughly two thirds of those that had remained; continuing like this we expect to have about

xp^⩽y 1 - p1 (4)

integers left by the time we have sieved with all the primes up toy . Once y = . qrt{x} the undeleted integers are 1 and the primes up tox, since every composite has a prime factor no bigger than its square root. So, is(4) a good approximation for the number of primes up tox when y = . qrt{x}? about what the formula in (4) is estimating. It is sup-To answer this question, we need to be more precise posed to approximate the number of integers up tothat have no prime factors less than or equal toy , plusx the number of primes up toy.
The so-called inclusion exclusion principle imation given in (4) is accurate to within 2 can be used to show that the approx-k, where k is the number of primes less than or equal tois very small, this error term of 2 k is far larger than they. Unless k quantity we are trying to estimate, and the approxima-tion is use less. It is quite good ifk is less than a small constant times logx, but, as we have seen, this is far less than the number of primes we expect up to$y \approx \sqrt{x}$. Thus it is not clear whether (4) can be usedy if to obtain a good estimate for the number of primes uptox.
What we can do, however, is use this argument to give an upper bound for the number of primes up tox, since the number of primes up to x is never more than the number of integers up tox that are free of prime factors less than or equal toof primes up toy, which is no more than 2 y, plus the numberk plus the expression in (4). the product Now$, by (2)$, we know that asp⩽y (1 - 1/p) converges to zero. There-y gets larger and larger fore, for any small positive numbery such that (1 - 1/p) < ε/2.
Since every term inεwe can find a this product is at least 1 Hence, for anyp(x⩽)y⩾ (22)k our error term, 2/2, the product is at least 1 k, is no bigger/2 k. than the quantity in (4), and therefore the number of primes up tox is no larger than twice (4), which, by our choice ofy, is less than εx. Since we were free to makeεproportion of all the integers, as we predicted.as small as we liked, the primes are indeed a vanishing

IV.2. Analytic Number Theory

Even though the error term in the inclusion–exclusion principle is too large for us to use that method toestimate (4) wheny = . qrt{x}, we can still hope that (4) is a good approximation for the number of primes up to$x$: perhaps a different argument would give us a much smaller error term. And this turns out to be the case: in fact, the error never gets much bigger than (4). However, when actually about 8 y = /. qrt{9} times (4). So why does (4) not givex the number of primes up to x is a good approximation?
After sieving with prime supposed that roughly 1 in everyp of the remainingp we integers were deleted: a careful analysis yields that this can be justified whenp is small, but that this becomes an increasingly poor approximation of what really hap-pens for larger p; in fact (4) does not give a correct approximation once So what goes wrong? In the hope that the proportion yis bigger than a fixed power ofx.
is roughly 1 consequences of sieving by/p lies the unspoken assumption that thep are independent of what happened with the primes smaller than primes under consider at i on are no longer small, thenp. But if the this assumption is false. This is one of the main rea-sons that it is hard to estimate the number of primes up toof many related problems. x, and indeed similar difficulties lie at the heart One can refine the bounds given above but they do not seem to yield an asymptotic estimate for the primes(that is, an estimate which is correct to within a factor that tends to 1 as xgets large).
The first good guesses for such an estimate emerged at the begin-ning of the nineteenth century, none better than what emerges from an observation ofwhen studying tables of primes up to three million gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), made at sixteen years of age, that “the density of primes at around x is about 1/ . og x.” Interpreting this, we guess that the number of primes up tox is aboutx 1 . pprox x dt .. og n2 . og tn=2

Let us compare this prediction (rounded to the nearest integer) with the latest data on numbers of primes, dis-covered by a mixture of ingenuity and computational power. Table 1 shows the actual numbers of primes up to various powers of 10 together with the difference between these numbers and what Gauss’s formula gives. The differences are far smaller than the numbers themselves, so his prediction is amazingly accu-rate. It does seem always to be an over count, but since the width of the last column is about half that of the

We can represent the primes as a In the 1930 s, Harald Cramér, the great probabil sequence of 0 s and 1 s. If we start with 3 and put a 1 each time we encounter a prime and 0 otherwise, then we obtain the sequence 1 idea is to suppose that this sequence, which repre-,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1, . . ..
Cramér’s sents the primes, has the same properties as a “typical”sequence of 0 s and 1 s, and to use this principle to make precise conjectures about the primes. More precisely, le tables$X^{3}$, X[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) taking the values 0 or 1, and let the4, . . .be an infinite sequence of random var i variable it equals 0 with probability 1 Xn equal 1 with probability 1 - 1/ . og n/). Assume also. og n (so that that the variables are independent, so for each led ge about the variables other than X tells us noth-m know- ing about Xmit self.
Cramér’s suggestion was that any mstatement about the distribution of 1 s in the sequence that represents the primes will be true if and only if it is true with probability 1 for his random sequences. Some care is needed in interpreting this statement: for example, with probability 1 a random sequence will contain infinitely many even numbers. However, it is possible to formulate a general principle that takes account of such examples. Here is an example of a use of the Gauss–Cramér model.
With the help of the central limit theorem 336 [III.71 §5](/part - 03/probability - distributions) one can prove that, with probability 1, there are x dt + O(. qrt{x}. og x) 2. og t 1 s among the first tells us that the same should be true of the sequencex terms in our sequence.
The model representing primes, and so we predict thatx dt . qrt #{primes up to x} = 2 . og t + O( x . og x), (5) just as the table suggests. The Gauss–Cramér model provides a beautiful way to think about distribution questions concerning the prime numbers, but it does not give proofs, and it does not seem likely that it can be made into such a tool; so for proofs we must look elsewhere. In analytic number theory one attempts to count objects that appear naturally in arithmetic, yet which resist being counted easily.
So far, our discussion of the primes has con-centrated on upper and lower bounds that follow from their basic definition and a few elementary properties—notably the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Some of these bounds are good and some not so good. To improve on these bounds we shall do something that seems unnatural at first, and reformulate our questionas a question about complex functions. This will allow us to draw on deep tools from analysis.

To be precise, he defined what we now call the complex values Riemann zeta function as follows:

$ζ(s) = {}^{n⩾1} n1^{s}$.

It can be shown quite easily that this sum converges whenever the real part ofs is greater than 1, as we have already seen in the case of real the great advantages of allowing complex values ofs. However, one ofs is that the resulting function isand we can use a process of holomorphic analytic continuation[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), to make sense oflar but more elementary example of this phenomenonζ(s) for every s apart from 1.

Gauss’s conjecture for the number of primes up tois equivalent to gaining a good understanding of thex zeros of the function for which$ζ(s) =$0. Riemann’s deep work gave birth toζ(s), that is, of the values of s our subject, so it seems worthwhile to at least sketch the key steps in the argument linking these seemingly unconnected topics. Riemann’s starting point was Euler’s formula (1). It is not hard to prove that this formula is valid whens is complex, as long as its real part is greater than 1, so wehaveζ(s) =p prime 1 - p(1 s)-1.
If we take the logarithm of both sides and then differ - entiate, we obtain the equation - ζζ(s)^ (s) =p prime p. og s - p1 = p primem⩾1 . og pmsp}. We need some way to distinguish between prime sp ⩽xprimesand prime sp for whichp > xx/p; that is, we want to count those⩾ 1, but not those with x/p < 1. This can be done using thethe value 0 fory < 1 and the value 1 for step function y >that takes1 (so that its graph looks like a step). At$y = 1$, the point of discontinuity, it is convenient to give the function the average value, 1 .

It turns out, though, that Gauss’s prediction for the number of primes up tox follows so long as we can show thatxis large. Notice that the sum in (6) is exactly the loga-is a good estimate for this weighted count when x rithm of the lowest common multiple of the integers less than or equal tothis weighted counting function for the primes is a nat-x, which perhaps explains why ural function to consider.
Another explanation is thatif the density of primes nearp is indeed about 1/ . og p, then multiplying by a weight of logp makes the density every where about 1.If you know some complex analysis, then you will know thatuate the integral in (6) in terms of the “residues” of Cauchy’s residue theorem allows one to eval the integrand$(ζ (s)/ζ(s))(x^{s} /s)$, that is, the poles of this function.

The idea is to multiply some simple function so that the resulting productζ(s)ξ(s)by satisfies the functional equation

$ξ(s) = ξ(1 - s) \text{for all} s$. (8)

He determined that this can be done by taking1$s(s - 1)π^{-s}/ {}^{2}Γ ( {}^{1}s)ζ(s)$. Here Γ (s) is the famousξ(s) = gamma function function at positive integers (that is,2 2[III.31](/part-03/the-gamma-function), which equals the factorial$Γ (n) = (n - 1)$!), and is well-defined and continuous for all others. zeros of A careful analysis of (1) reveals that there are noζ(s) with Re(s) > 1. Then, with the help of

337

(8), we can deduce that the only zeros of Re(s) < 0 lie at the negative even integers -ζ(s)2,-4 with, . . . (the “trivial zeros”). So, to be able to use (7), we need todetermine the zeros inside the critical strip, the set of alls such that 0 ⩽ Re(s) ⩽ 1. Here Riemann made yet another extraordinary observation which, if true, would allow us tremendous insight into virtually every aspect of the distribution of primes. The Riemann hypothesis.0, then Re(s) =1.
If 0 ⩽ Re(s) ⩽ 1 and ζ(s) = line Re It is known that there are infinitely many zeros on the(s) =1 2, crowding closer and closer together as we go up the line. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified computationally for the ten billion zeros of lowest height (that is, with|Im(s)| smallest), it can be shown to hold for at least 40% of all zeros, and it fits nicely with many different heuristic assertions about the distribution of primes and other sequences. Yet, for all that, it remains an unproved hypothesis, perhaps the most famous and tantalizing in all of mathematics.
mann’s memoir gives no hint as to how he came upwith such an extraordinary conjecture, and for a long How did Riemann think of his “hypothesis”? Rie time afterwards it was held up as an example of the great heights to which humankind could ascend by pure thought alone. However, in the 1920 s Siegel and weil [VI.93](/part - 06/andr - weil - 19061998) got hold of Riemann’s unpublished notes and from these it is evident that Riemann had been able to determine the lowest few zeros to several decimal places through extensive hand calculations—somuch for “pure thought alone”!
Nevertheless, the Riemann hypothesis is a mammoth leap of imagination and to have come up with an algorithm to calculate zeros of put at i on al number theoryζ(s) is a remarkable achievement. (See[IV.3](/part - 04/computational - number - theory) for a discussion ofcom- how zeros of If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then it is not hardζ(s) can be calculated.) to prove the bound xρρ ⩽ |Imx1(ρ()/)2 |.

Inserting this into (7) one can deduce that. qrt . og p = x + O( x . og2 x). (9)(pp)prim(e⩽)x This, in turn, can be “translated” into (5). In fact these estimates hold if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true. The Riemann hypothesis is not an easy thing to understand, nor to fully appreciate. The equivalent, (5),

The right-hand side here is the over count in Gauss’sprediction for the number of primes up tox, divided by something that grows like the table of primes it seemed that this quantity should. qrt{x}. When we looked at be roughly constant. However, that is not quite true aswe see upon examining the right-hand side. The first term on the right-hand side, the “1,” corresponds tothe contribution of the squares of the primes in (7). The subsequent terms correspond to the terms involving the zeros ofinatorγso the most significant terms in this sum areζ(s)$in (7)$;
these terms have denom those with the smallest values of these terms is a sine wave, which oscillates, half theγ. More over, each of time positive and half the time negative. Having the “log slowly (which is why we hardly notice them in the table$x$” in there means that these oscillations happen above), but they do happen, and indeed the quantity in(10) does eventually get negative.
No one has yet determined a value of value ofx for which there are more thanx for which this is negative (that is, ax(1/ . og t) dt primes up totime this happens is for x), though our best guess is that the first2 x . pprox 1.398 . imes 10316. How does one arrive at such a guess given that the table of primes extends only up to 1022? One begins by using the first thousand terms of the right-hand side of (10)to approximate the left-hand side;
wherever it looks as though it could be negative, one approximates with more terms, maybe a million, until one becomes pretty certain that the value is indeed negative. It is not uncommon to try to understand a given function better by representing it as a sum of sines and cosines like this; indeed this is how one studies the harmonics in music, and (10) becomes quite compelling from this perspective. Some experts suggest that (10) IV. Branches of Mathematics tells us that “the primes have music in them” and thus makes the Riemann hypothesis believable, even desirable.
To prove unconditionally that #{primes ⩽ x} ∼2 x . og dtt}, the so-called same approach as above but, since we are not asking for prime number theorem, we can take the such a strong approximation to the number of primes up tox, we need to show only that the zeros near to the line Re(s) = 1 do not contribute much to the for-$mula (7)$. By the end of the nineteenth century this task had been reduced to showing that there are no zeros actually on the line Re$(s) =$1:
this was eventually established by de la vallée poussin [VI.67](/part-06/charles-jean-de-la-valle-poussin-18661962) and hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) in 1896.Subsequent research has provided wider and wider subregions of the critical strip with out zeros of(and thus improved approximations to the number ofζ(s) primes up to proving the Riemann hypothesis.
This remains as anx), with out coming any where near to outstanding open problem of mathematics. A simple question like “How many primes are there up to ment ary methods rather than all of these methods of$x$?” deserves a simple answer, one that uses ele complex analysis, which seem far from the question athand. However, (7) tells us that the prime number theorem is trueon the line Reif and only if(s) = 1, and so one might argue that it there are no zeros of ζ(s) is inevitable that complex analysis must be involved insuch a proof.
In 1949 Selberg and Erd ̋os surprised the mathematical world by giving an elementary proof of the prime number theorem. Here, the word “elemen-tary” does not mean “easy” but merely that the proof does not use advanced tools such as complex analysis—in fact, their argument is a complicated one. Of course their proof must some how show that there is no zeroon the line Re(s) = 1, and indeed their combinator- ics cunningly masks a subtle complex analysis proof beneath the surface (read Ingham’s discussion (1949) for a careful examination of the argument).
4 Primes in Arithmetic Progressions After giving good estimates for the number of primes up tox, which from now on we shall denote by π(x), we might ask for the number of such primes that are congruent toa mod q. (If you do not know what this means, seeπ(x; q, a) for this quantity. To start with, note that modular arithmetic [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic).) Let us write

IV.2. Analytic Number Theory

there is only one prime congruent to 2 mod 4, and indeed there can be no more than one prime in any arithmetic progression a, a + q, a + 2 q, . . . if a and q have a common factor greater than 1. Letthe number of integers$a$, 1 ⩽ a ⩽ q, such thatφ(q)(a, q)denote = 1. (The notation factor ofa and q(a, q).) Then all but a small finite number stands for the highest common of the infinitely many primes belong to the met ic progressions$a$, a + q, a + 2 q, . . . with 1φ(q)⩽ a < qarith- and(a, q) = 1.
Calculation reveals that the primes seem to be pretty evenly split between these progressions, so we might guess that in the limit theφ(q) arithmetic proportion of primes in each of them is 1 is, whenever(a, q) = 1, we might conjecture that, as/φ(q). Thatx → $\infty$,π(x; q, a) ∼ π(x)φ(q). (11) congruent toorem of It is far from obvious even that the number of primes dirichleta mod[VI.36]. To begin to consider such qis infinite.
This is a famous the questions we need a systematic way to identify integersn that are congruent to a mod q, and this Dirichlet pro- vided by introducing a class of functions now known as (Dirichlet) characters. Formally, a character modq is a functionχ from Z to C with the following three properties (in ascending order of interest): (i)χ(n) = 0 whenever n and q have a common factor(ii) greater than 1;χevery integer is periodic modn); q (that is, χ(n + q) = χ(n) for (iii)χ is multiplicative (that is, χ(mn) = χ(m)χ(n) for any two integersm and n).
An easy but important example of a character modis the principal character$χ^{q}$, which takes the value 1 ifq(n, q)important example is the= 1 and 0 otherwise. If Legendre sym bolq is prime, then another(^· ): one sets (residue mo(dn)q ) to be 0 ifqn, andis a multiple of-1 if n is a quadratic nonresidueq, 1 if n is a quadraticq modifn is congruent modq. (An integer n is called aq to a perfect square.) Ifquadratic residueq is com-mod q posite, then a function known as the symbol$( {}^{·} )$, which generalizes the Legendre symbol, Legendre–Jacobi is also a character.
This too is an important example that helps us, in a slightly less direct way, to recognize$q$ squares mod These characters are all real-valued, which is theq. exception rather than the rule. Here is an example of a genuinely complex-valued character in the case q = 5. Set χ(n) to be 0 if n ≡ 0 (mod 5), i if n ≡ 339 2,-1 if n ≡ 4, -i if n ≡ 3, and 1 if n ≡ 1. To see that this is a character, note that the powers of 2 mod 5 are 2 i are i,-1, -i,1,,4 i,,3-,11,,-2, i,41,, . . .3, 1, . . ..
, while the powers of characters modthe properties above, together with the following for-It can be shown that there are precise lyq. Their usefulness to us comes fromφ(q) distinct mula, in which the sum is over all characters modan. ar{d}χ(a) denotes the complex conjugate of χ(a): qφ(q)1χ χ(a)χ(n) ̄= ⎧⎨⎩1 if0 otherwisen ≡ a (mod. q), What is this formula doing for us? Well, understand-ing the set of integers congruent toa mod q is equiva- lent to understanding the function that takes the value1 ifn ≡ a (mod q) and 0 otherwise. This function appears on the right-hand side of the formula.
How-ever, it is not a particularly nice function to deal with, so we write it as a linear combination of characters, which are much nicer functions because they are mul-tiplicative. The coefficient associated with the character χin this linear combination is the numbe. ar{r}χ(a)/φ(q). From the formula, it follows that

. og pp}prim(ep()m()⩽){}$, (mx()⩾){1}(pm()≡){a} (modq)= φ(q)1 χ(a) χ(pm)$. og p.χ (modq()p)prim(ep)m^⩽^, mx^⩾1

The sum on the left-hand side is a natural adaptation ofthe sum we considered earlier when we were counting all primes. And we can estimate it if we can get good estimates for each of the sums

$χ(p^{m}) \log p$.pprim(ep()m()⩽){}, (mx()⩾){1} We approach these sums much as we did before, obtain-ing an explicit formula, analogous to (7), (10), now in terms of the zeros of the Dirichlet L-function:

L(s$, χ) = {}^{n⩾1} χ(n)n^{s}$.

This function turns out to have properties closely analogous to the main properties ofζ(s). In particular, it is here that the multiplica ti vi ty ofχ is all-important, since it gives us a formula similar to (1):χ(n)ns = 1 - χ(p)(ps)-1. (12)(n⩾()1){p}prime 340 That is, the “generalized Riemann hypothesis” that all zeros L(s, χ) has an Euler product. We also believeρ of This would imply that the number of primes up to L(ρ, χ) = 0 in the critical strip satisfy Re(ρ) =1 2 x. that are congruent toa mod q can be estimated asπ(x; q, a) = π(x)φ(q) + O(. qrt{x}. og2(qx)).
(13) Therefore, the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies the estimate we were hoping for (formula (11)), provided thatx is a little bigger than q2. that is, with out the help of the generalized riemann hypothesis? Although we can more or less translate the In what range can we prove (11) unconditionally— proof of the prime number theorem over into this new setting, we find that it gives (11) only whenx is very large.
In fact, x has to be bigger than an exponential in a power of little larger than$q$, which is a lot bigger than the “$q2$” that we obtained from the general-x is a ized Riemann hypothesis. We see a new type of problem emerging here, in which we are asking for a good start-ing point for the range ofx for which we obtain good estimates, as a function of the modulus$q$; this does not have an analogy in our exploration of the prime num-ber theorem.
By the way, even though this bound “x is a little larger than$q2$” is far out of reach of current methods, it still does not seem to be the best answer;
 calcu-la tions reveal that (11) seems to hold whenx is just a little bigger thanq. So even the Riemann hypothesis and its generalizations are not powerful enough to tellus the precise behavior of the distribution of primes. Through out the twentieth century much thought was put in to bounding the number of zeros of dirichlet functions near to the 1-line. It turns out that one can L- make enormous improvements in the range ofx for which (11) holds (to “halfway between polynomial inq and exponential in q”) provided there are no Siegel zeros numbers with.

Despite the possibility of the existencea mod q

a prime less thanq5.5 if qis sufficiently large. Obtaining a result of this type is not difficult when there are no Siegel zeros. If there are Siegel zeros, then we goback to the explicit formula, which is similar to (7) but now concerns zeros of L(s, χ). If β is a Siegel zero, then it turns out that in the explicit formula there are nowtwo obviously large terms:$x/φ(q) and -( a )x^{β}/βφ(q)$. When(a q ) = 1 it appears that they might almost can celq (sinceβ is close to 1), but with more care we obt a inx - aq xβ^β = (x - x^β) + x^β 1 - 1β ∼ x(1 - β) . og x.
This is a smaller main term than before, but it is nottoo hard to show that it is bigger than the contributions of all of the other zeros combined, because the Deuring–Heilbronn phenomenon implies that the Siegel zero repels those zeros, forcing them to be far to the left. When(a ) = −1, the same two terms tell us that if primes as we would expect up to(1 - β) . og qx is small, then there are twice as manyx that are congruent toa mod q. and algebraic numbers There is a close connection between Siegel zeros class numbers, which are defined and discussed in[IV.1 §7](/part-04/number-theory).

A6$, class number is always a positive integer, so this result immediately implies that$- q L(1$, (· )) ⩾ π/. qrt{q}. Another consequence is thatis small. The reason this gives us information abouth - q is small if and only ifq L(1, (q · )) Siegel zeros is that one can show that the derivative L^ (σ , (· )) is positive (and not too small) for real num - bersσqclose to 1.

true but remains unproved, then Siegel’s proof can not be exploited to give explicit bounds. This dichotomy, between what can be proved with an explicit constant and what cannot be, is seen far and wide in analytic number theory—and when it appears it usually stems from an application of Siegel’s result, and especially its consequences for the range in which the estimate (11) is valid. take on prime values when we substitute in an inte-ger. To see this, note that if A polynomial with integer coefficients cannot alwaysp divides f (m) then p also div i desf (m + p)$, f (m + 2p)$, . . . .
However, there are some prime-rich polynomials, a famous example being the polynomialx2 + x + 41, which is prime forx = 0,1,2, . . . , 39. There are almost certainly quadratic polynomials that take on more consecutive prime val-ues, though their coefficients would have to be very large. If we ask the more restricted question of when the polynomial$x^{2} + x + p \text{is prime for} x = 0$, 1, 2, . . . , p - 2, then the answer, given by Rabinowitch, is rather sur-pr ising: it happens if and only if$h = 1$, where q = 4 bers and predicted that there are just nine values ofp - 1.

It therefore came as a surprise when Maier showed, in1984, that, for any fixed A > 0, the estimate (14) fails for infinitely many integers$x$, with y = (. og x)A. His ingenious proof rests on showing that the small primes do not always have as many multiples in an interval as one might expect. Let$p = 2 < p = 3 < · · · \text{be the sequence}$ of primes. We are now interested in the size of the gaps$p^{1} - p \text{between consecutive primes}$.
Since2 there are about difference is log(n+1)nx/x . og and we might ask how often thex primes up to x, the average difference between consecutive primes is about aver-age, whether the differences can get really small, and whether the differences can get really large. The Gauss–Cramér model suggests that the proportion ofn for which the gap between consecutive primes is more than. ambda times the average, that is p - p > λ. og p , is approximately eintervals[x$, x + {}^{-}λ^{λ}$;
and, similarly, the proportion of. og x] containing exactl(yn()+1)n k primesn is approximately e$- {}^{λ}λ^{k}/k$!, a suggestion which, as we shall see, is supported by other considerations. By looking at the tail of this distribution, Cramér conjectured that lim supn→. nfty((pn)+1 - pn)/(. og pn)2 = 1, and the evidence we have The Gauss–Cramér model does have a big drawback: seems to support this (see table 2). it does not “know any arithmetic.” In particular, as we noted earlier, it does not predict divisibility by small primes.
One manifestation of this failing is that it predicts that there should be just about as many gapsof length 1 between primes as there are of length 2. However, there is only one gap of length 1, since iftwo primes differ by 1, then one of them must be even, where as there are many examples of pairs of primes differing by 2, and there are believed to be infinitely many. For the model to make correct conjectures about prime pairs, we must consider divisibility by small primes in the formulation of the model, which makes it rather more complicated.
Since there are these glaring errors in the simpler model, Cramér’s conjec-ture for the largest gaps between consecutive primes must be treated with a degree of suspicion. And infact, if one corrects the model to account for divisibility by small primes, one is led to conjecture that lim sup(p - p )/(. og p )2 is greater than9. finding long sequences of composite numbers. How about trying to do this explicitly?
For example, we know Finding large gaps between primes is equivalent to n→$\infty$ n+1 n n 8 that$n$!+ j is composite for 2 ⩽ j ⩽ n, as it is divisi- ble byn between consecutive primes, the first of which isj. Therefore we have a gap of length at least

Of course, it is believed that there are infinitely many$n^{→}$. nfty((pn)+1 - pn)/(. og pn) = pairs of primes that differ by 2, but this question seems intractable for now. the question of small gaps; the best result before 2000 Until recently researchers had very little success with was that there are infinitely many gaps of size less than one-quarter of the average.

In fact, for every even integer 2 k there seem to be many pairs of primes that differ by 2 one has yet proved that there are infinitely many. Thisk, but again no is one of the outstanding problems in the subject.
1760 s: is it true that every even integer greater than 2 In a similar vein is Goldbach’s conjecture from the is the sum of two primes? This is still an open ques - tion, and indeed a publisher recently offered a million dollars for its solution. We know it is true for almost all integers, and it has been computer tested for every even integer up to 4 . imes 1014.
The most famous result on this question is due to Chen (1966), who showed that every even integer can be written as the sum of a prime and a second integer that has at most two prime factors (that is, it could be a prime or an “almost - prime”).In fact, goldbach [VI.17](/part - 06/christian - goldbach - 16901764) never asked this question.
He asked Euler, in a letter in the 1760 s, whether every integer greater than 1 can be written as the sum of at most three primes, which would imply what we now call the “Goldbach conjecture.” In the 1920 s vinogradov showed that every sufficiently large odd integer can be 343 written as the sum of three primes (and thus every suf-fic ient ly large even integer can be written as the sum of four primes). We actually believe that every odd inte-ger greater than 5 is the sum of three primes but the known proofs only work once the numbers involved are large enough.
In this case we can be explicit about “sufficiently large”—at the moment the proof needs themto be at least e5700, but it is rumored that this may soon be substantially reduced, perhaps even to 7.To guess at the precise number of prime pairs q, q + 2 with q ⩽ x we proceed as follows. If we do not consider divisibility by the small primes, then the Gauss–Cramér model suggests that a random integer up towe might exp ectx is prime with probability roughly 1 x/(. og x)2 prime pairs q,/ q. og + x2 up, so to primes, as thex.
However, we do have to account for the smallq, q + 1 example shows, so let us con - sider 2 - divisibility.

Another truly extraordinary breakthrough occurred recently with a result of Green and Tao, proved in 2004, which states that for everykthere are infinitely many kof integers-term arithmetic progressions of primes: that is, pairs$a$, d such that a$, a + d$, a + 2 d, . . . , a+(k - 1)d are all prime. Green and Tao are currently hard at work attempting to show that the number ofk-term arith- metic progressions of primes is indeed well approx i-mated by (15). They are also extending their results to other families of polynomials.

This sum is domi-ζ(s) as nated by the terms corresponding to those pairs for which2 n |γ - γ |1 is small (in which case there is lit-2 γj, γk tle cancellation in the integral).
Therefore, in order to understand the variance for the distribution of primes$j^{k}$ in short intervals we need to understand the dis tr ibu-tion of the zeros ofζ(s) in short intervals. In 1973 Montgomery investigated this and suggested that the proportion of pairs of zeros ofζ(s)whose difference is less thanα times the average gap between consecutive zeros is given by the integral

$α 1 - \sin πθ^{2} dθ$, (16)

and he proved an equivalent form of this in a lim-ited range. If the zeros were placed “randomly,” then (16) would be replaced byfor smallα, which is far smaller thanα. In fact (16) is aboutα. This mean(s1)9α3 that there are far fewer pairs of zeros ofζ(s) that are close together than one might expect, which we express informally by saying that the zeros ofζ(s) repel one another.

9 Sieve Methods Almost all of our discussion so far has been about de-velopments of Riemann’s approach to counting primes. This approach is very delicate and not as adaptableas one might wish to many natural questions (such as counting However, one can go back tok-tuples of primes nsieve methods + a1$, n + a2$, . . . , n, which are + ak). modifications of the sieve of Eratosthenes, and at least get upper bounds. For example, suppose we want to find an upper bound for the number of prime pairsn, n + 2 with N < n ⩽ 2 N.
One possibility would be to fix a numbern, n + 2 with N < ny and determine for how many pairs⩽ 2 N it is the case that neither ny norto ben(+2 N)2 has a prime factor less tha(n1()/){2}, then this method would exactly county. If we took the twin primes, but it seems to be far too difficult toimplement. But it turns out that if instead we take$y$ to be a small power of N, then the calculations become much easier and there are methods of obtaining good bounds.

This principle is best exhibited when count-In the 1920 s Brun showed how to make the principle ing the number of integersto given integerm. We begin with the number of inte-n in a set S that are coprime gers in S, which is obviously more than the quantity we seek. Next, we subtract, for each prime the number of integers in S that are divisible byp dividingpm.

To compensaten is not coprime to m). Thus we obtain a number for that, we add back in the number of integers indivisible bypq for each pair of primes p < q which S divide for the contribution ofm. We have now counted 1 n, which is greater than or equal + r . imes (-1) +r 2 . imes 1 to 0, and greater than 0 for r ⩾ 3.
Similarly, we subtract the number of integers divisible by For eachn \in  S we end up counting pqr, etc.(1 - 1)r fornof, where(m, n). Expanding this sum with the binomial the-r is the number of distinct prime factors orem we may reexpress this identity as follows. Letχ (n) = 1 if (n, m) = 1 and 0 otherwise.

On cannot possibly give the exact answer, since they are missing many appropriate terms.

It was by using such methods that Chen was able to prove there are infinitely manyprimesp for which p + 2 has at most two prime fac- tors, and that Goldston, Pintz, and Yıldırım were able toestablish that there are some times short gaps between primes. These methods are also an essential ingredient in the work of Green and Tao.
One can also get good upper bounds on the number of primes in arithmetic progressions and short intervals: • the number of primes in any interval of length y• is never greater than 2 the number of primes less thany/ . og y; x in an arith-metic progression mod2$x/φ(q)\log (x/q)$. q is never greater than Notice that in each case the log in the denominator is of the number of integers being considered ($y$ andx/qwill only make a significant difference if the number, respectively), not logx as expected, though this of integers being considered is small.
Otherwise these inequalities are bigger than the expected quantity by a factor of 2. Can this “2” be improved? It will be difficult because we showed earlier that if there are Siegel zeros then we get twice as many primes as expected in certain arithmetic progressions. Therefore, if we can improve the “2” in these two formulas, then we can deduce that there are no Siegel zeros! 10 Smooth Numbers An integer isless than or equal toy - smoot hy .

The type that has received the most attention recently is a class ofcan be associated with elliptic curves (see L-functions that arithmetic geometryan equation of the form[IV.5 §5.1](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry)). Any2 elliptic curve = x3 + ax +Ebis given by, where the discriminant 4 a3 + 27 b2 is nonzero. The associated L- function Euler product: L(E, s) is most easily described in terms of its L(E, s) =p 1 - a(pp)s + p(p2()s)-1.

It can be shown that each mod p) to the equation y|a2 ≡| is less thanx3 +ax +b2 when Re. qrt{p}, so the Euler product above converges absolutely(s) >3. Therefore, (17) is a good definition for pthese values ofthe complex plane, as we did for2 s. Can we now extend it to the whole ofζ(s)? This is a very deep problem—the answer is yes; in fact, it is the celebrated theorem of Andrew Wiles that implied last theorem [V.10](/part - 05/fermats - last - theorem). fermat’s distribution of values of primes Another interesting question is to understand thep.
These all lie in the intervalap/2. qrt{p} [as we range over-1,1]. One might expect them to be uniformly distributed in the inter-val, but in fact this is never the case. As discussed in algebraic numbers where$|α | =$. qrt{p}, and[IV.1](/part - 04/number - theory) one can writeα is called the Weil number. Ifap = αp + α ̄p , we write angleθ αp \in = √[0, π]pe±.

The surprise is that for almost all elliptic curves thep θp are not uniform lyp distributed, which would mean the proportion in a cer-tain arc would be proportional to the length of that arc. Rather, they are distributed in such a way that the pro-portion of them in any given arc is proportional to the area under that arc. This is a recent result of Richard Taylor.

1 Introduction

Historically, computation has been a driving force inthe development of mathematics. To help measure the sizes of their fields, the Egyptians invented geometry. To help predict the positions of the planets, the Greeks invented trigonometry. Algebra was invented to deal

with equations that arose when mathematics was usedto model the world. The list goes on, and it is not just historical. If anything, computation is more important than ever. Much of modern technology rests on algorithms that compute quickly:
examples range from the wavelets [VII.3](/part-07/wavelets-and-applications) that allow CAT scans, to the numerical extrapolation of extremely complex systems in order to predict weather and global warming, and to the combinatorial algorithms that lie behind Internet search engines (see the mathematics of algorithm design [VII.5 §6](/part-07/the-mathematics-of-algorithm-design)). of our great theorems and conjectures are, at root, motivated by computational experience.
It is said that In pure mathematics we also compute, and many gauss needed only to work out a concrete example or two[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), who was an excellent computational ist, to discover, and then prove, the underlying theorem. While some branches of pure mathematics have perhaps lost contact with their computational origins, the advent of cheap computational power and convenient mathematical software has helped to reverse this trend.
One mathematical area where the new emphasis on computation can be clearly felt is number theory, and that is the main topic of this
article. A prescient call-toarms was issued by Gauss as long ago as 1801: The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers, and of resolving the latter into their prime factors, is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic. It has engaged the industry and wisdom of ancient and modern geometersto such an extent that it would be superfluous to discuss the problem at length.
Nevertheless we must con-fess that all methods that have been proposed thus far are either restricted to very special cases or are so labo-rious and difficult that even for numbers that do not exceed the limits of tables constructed by estimable men, they try the patience of even the practiced calculator. And these methods do not apply at all to larger numbers. . . . Further, the dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means beexplored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated.
number theory, but essentially all branches of num-ber theory have a computational component. And in Factorization into primes is a very basic issue in some areas there is such a robust computational liter-ature that we discuss the algorithms involved as mathematically interesting objects in their own right. In this article we will briefly present a few examples of the computational spirit: in analytic number theory (the distribution of primes and the Riemann hypothesis);

in Diophantine equations (Fermat’s last theorem andthe ABC conjecture); and in elementary number theory (primality and factorization). A secondary theme that we shall explore is the strong and constructive inter-play between computation, heuristic reasoning, and conjecture. 2 Distinguishing Prime Numbers from Composite Numbers The problem is simple to state. Given an integer decide ifn is prime or composite. And we all know ann > 1, algorithm. Divide Either we find a proper factor, in which case we known by each positive integer in turn.
that know thatn is composite, or we do not, in which case wen is prime. For example, take n = 269. It is odd, so it has no even divisors. It is not a multiple of 3, so it has no divisor which is a multiple of 3. Continuing, we rule out 5, 7, 11, and 13. The next possibility, 17, hasa square that is greater than 269, which means that if 269 were a multiple of 17, then it would also have to be a multiple of some number less than 17. Since we have ruled that out, we can stop our trial division at 13 and conclude that 269 is prime.
(If we were actually carrying out the algorithm, we might try dividing 269 by 17, in which case we would discover that 269$= 15 \times 17 + 14$. At that point we would notice that the quotient, 15, is less than 17, which is what would tell us that 172 was greater than 269. Then we could stop.) In general, since a composite number d ⩽ . qrt{n}, one can give up on the trial dividing once onen has a proper factor d with passes$\sqrt{n}$, at which point we know that n is prime.
tal computation with small numbers, and for machine This straightforward method is excellent for men computation for some what larger numbers. But it scales poorly, in that if you double the number of digits of$n$, then the time for the worst case is squared; it is therefore an “exponential-time” algorithm. One might tolerate such an algorithm for twenty-digit inputs, but think how long it would take to establish the primalityof a forty-digit number! And you can forget about numbers with hundreds or thousands of digits.
The issue of how the running time of an algorithm scales when one goes to larger inputs is absolutely paramount inmeasuring one algorithm against another. In contrast to the exponential time it takes to use trial division torecognize primes, consider the problem of multiplying two numbers. The school method of multiplication is to take each digit of one number in turn and multiplyit by the other number, forming a parallelogram array.

350

One then performs an addition to obtain the answer. If you now double the number of digits in each number, then the parallelogram becomes twice as large in each dimension, so the running time grows by a factorof about 4. Multiplication of two numbers is an example of a “polynomial time” algorithm; its running timescales by a constant factor when the input length is doubled. lows. Is there a polynomial-time algorithm that distin-guishes prime numbers from composite numbers?
Is One might then rephrase Gauss’s call to arms as fol there a polynomial-time algorithm that can produce anontrivial factor of a composite number? It might not be apparent at this point that these are two different questions, since trial division does both. We will see, though, that it is convenient to separate them, as did Gauss. Let us focus on recognizing primes. What we would like is a simply computed criterion that primes satisfy and composites do not, or vice versa. An old theorem of Wilson might just fit the bill. Note that 6!$= 720$, which is just one less than a multiple of 7.
Wilson’stheorem asserts that ifn is prime, then (n - 1)!≡ −1(is explained inmod n). (The meaning of this and similar statements modular arithmetic [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic).) This can- not hold whenfactor ofn and is smaller thann is composite, for ifn, then it is a fac-p is a prime tor of$(n - 1)(n$!+-1. Thus, we have an ironclad criterion for1)!, so it cannot possibly be a factor of primality. However, the Wilson criterion does not meet the standard of being simply computed, since we know no especially rapid way of computing factorials mod-ulo another number.
For example, Wilson predicts that 268!$≡ −1 (mod 269)$, as we have already seen that 269 is prime. But if we did not know this already, howin the world could we quickly find the remainder when 268! is divided by 269? We can work out the product268! one factor at a time, but this would take many more steps than trying divisors up to 17. It is hard to prove that something cannot be done, and in fact there is no theorem that says we cannot compute in polynomial time. We do know some ways of speed-$a$!

So, Wilson’s theorem initially seems promising, but in fact it is no help at all unless we can find a fast way to compute$a$! modb. that 2 take 3 How about75== 128, which is 2 more than a multiple of 7.

If computing a large factorial modulo is prime and a is any integer, thennpower modulo is hard, perhaps it is also hard to compute a largen. ple to see if any ideas pop up. Take that we are trying to compute 2 It cannot hurt to try it out for some moderate exam-91$amod 91$. A powerful = 2 and n = 91, so idea in mathematics is that of reduction. Can we reduce this computational problem to a smaller one? Notice that if we had already computed 245 mod 91, obtaining a remainder$r^{1}$, say$, then 291 ≡ 2(r1)2 (mod 91)$.
That is, it is just a short additional calculation to get to our goal, yet the power 45 is only half as big. How to continue is clear: we further reduce to the exponent 22, which isless than half of 45. If 222 mod 91$= r$, then 245 ≡ 2 r2(so on. It is not so hard to “automate” this procedure: mod 91). And of course 222 is the square of (22)11$, and2$ the exponent sequence 1, 2, 5, 11, 22, 45, 91 can be read directly from the binary (base 2) re pre sen-tation of 91 as 1011011, since the above sequence in binary is 1, 10, 101, 1011, 10110, 101101, 1011011.
These are the initial strings from the left of 1011011.And it is plain that the transition from one term to the next is either the double or the double plus 1. digits of This procedure scales nicely. When the number ofn is doubled, so is the sequence of expo - nents, and the time it takes to get from one exponentto the next, being a modular multiplication, is multiplied by 4. (As with naive multiplication, naive divide - with-remainder also takes four times as long when the size of the problem is doubled.) Thus, the over all timeis multiplied by 8, yielding a polynomial time method.
We call this the “powermod” algorithm. taking So, let us try to illustrate Fermat’s little theorem, a = 2 and n = 91. Our sequence of powers is21≡ 2$, 2^{2} ≡ 4, 2^{5} ≡ 32, 2^{1}1 ≡ 46,$ 222≡ 23, 2^45 ≡ 57, 2^91 ≡ 37, where each congruence is modulo 91, and each term in the sequence is found by squaring the prior one mod 91 or squaring and multiplying by 2 mod 91. that we are supposed to get 2 for the final residue? Well, yes, but this is guaranteed only if Wait a second: does Fermat’s little theorem not sayn is prime. And as you have probably already noticed, 91 is composite.
In fact, the computation proves this.

The answer you should come to is that 3 You are invited to try out the powermod algorithm91≡ 3(orem holds. Since you already know that 91 is com-mod 91): that is, the congruence for Fermat’s little the posi te, I am sure you would not jump to the false conclusion that it is prime!
So, as it stands, Fermat’s little theorem can some times be used to recognize composites, but it cannot be used to recognize primes. There are two interesting further points to be made regarding Fermat’s little theorem. First, on the nega-tive side, there are some composites, such as$n = 561$, where the Fermat congruence holds for These num be rsn are called Carmichael numbers every integer, anda. unfortunately (from the point of view of testing primality) there are infinitely many of them, a result dueto Alford, Granville, and me.
But, on the positive side, if one were to choose randomly among all pairs for which$a^{n} ≡ a (mod n)$, with a < n and n bounded a, n by a large numberx, almost certainly (as x grows) you would choose a pair with myself.nprime, a result of Erd ̋os and with another elementary property of (odd) prime num-bers. If It is possible to combine Fermat’s little the ore mn is an odd prime, there are exactly two solu- tions to the congruence$x^{2} ≡ 1 (mod n)$, namely ±1.
Actually, some composites have this property as well, but composites divisible by two different odd primes do not. Now let us suppose thatn is an odd number and that we wish to determine whether it is prime. Suppose thatwe pick some number a with 1 ⩽ a ⩽ n - 1 and discover thatx2 = an(a-n()1)-1≡≡1 1(mod(modn)n). If we set; so, by the simple proper tyx = a((n-1))/ {}2, then of primes just mentioned, ifbe±1. Therefore, if we calculaten is prime, thena((n-1))/2 and discoverx must that it is not congruent to$±1 (mod n)$, then n must be composite. Let us try this idea with$a = 2$, n = 561.
We know already that 22280 mod 561? This too turns out to be 1, so we have560≡ 1 (mod 561), so what is not shown that 561 is composite. However, we can go further, since now we know that 2140 is also a square root of 1 and computing this we find that 2140≡ 67(that is notmod 561). So now we have found a square root of 1±1, which proves that 561 is composite. (Of course, for this particular number, it is obviously 351 divisible by 3, so there was not really any mystery about whether it was prime or composite.
But the method can be used in much less obvious cases.) In practice, there is no need to backtrack from a higher exponent to a smaller one. Indeed, in order to calculate 2560 mod 561 by the efficient method outlined earlier, one calculates the numbers 2140 and 2280 along the way, so that this generalization of the earlier test is both quicker and stronger. Suppose that not divisible by Here is the general principle that we have illustrated.n is an odd prime and letn. Write n - 1 = 2 st, wherea be an integert is odd. Then either at ≡ 1 (mod n) or (a2()i)t ≡ −1 (mod n) for somei = 0,1, . . .
, s - 1. Call this the strong Fer- mat congruence proved independently by Monier and Rabin, there is no. The wonderful thing here is that, as analogue of a Carmichael number. They showed that ifn is an odd composite, then the strong Fermat congru- ence fails for at least three quarters of the choices fora with 1 ⩽ a ⩽ n - 1. If you want only to be able to distinguish between primes and composites in practice, and you do not insist on proof, then you have read enough.
Namely, given a large odd number a at random from [1, n - 1 n], and begin trying to verify, choose twenty values of the strong Fermat congruence with these bases should ever fail, you may stop: the numbern must bea. If it composite. And if the strong Fermat congruence holds, we might surmise th atn were composite, the Monier–Rabin theorem says thatn is actually prime. Indeed, if the chance that the strong Fermat congruence would hold for twenty random bases is at most 4-20, which is less than one chance in a trillion. Thus we have aremarkable probabilistic test for primality.
If it tells us that composite; if it tells us thatn is composite, then we know for sure thatn is prime, then the chancesn is that negligible.n is not prime are so small as to be more or less If three quarters of the numbers a in [1, n - 1] pro- vide the key to an easily checkable proof that the odd composite numbern is indeed composite, surely it should not be so hard to find just one! How about checking small numbers Excellent, but when do we stop? Let us think about this a, in order, until one is found? for a moment.
We have given up the power of random-ness and are forcing ourselves to choose sequentially among small numbers for the trial bases argue heuristically that they continue to behave as ifa. Can we 352 they were random choices? Well, there ne ct i ons among them. For example, if taking are a some con-= 2 does not result in a proof thatn is composite, then neither will taking any power of 2. It is theoretically possible for2 and 3 not to give proofs thatn is composite but for 6 to work just fine, but this turns out not to be very common.
So let us amend the heuristic and assume that we have independence for prime values ofa. Up to log prime number the ore mn log log n there are about log[V.26](/part - 05/the - prime - number - theorem - and - the - vi34 - jnos - bolyai - 18021860) discussed later in thisn primes (via the article); so, heuristically, the probability thatposite, but that none of these primes help us to prove it, n is com-is about 4-. og n < n-4^/3. Since the infinite sum(n-4()/){3} converges, perhaps a stopping point of logis sufficient, at least for largen.
n log log n that a stopping point of Miller was able to prove the slightly weaker res ultc(. og n)2 is adequate, but his proof assumes a generalization of the hypothesis [V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860). (We discuss the Riemann hypoth-riemann esis below; the generalization that Miller assumes is beyond the scope of this article.) In further work, Bach was able to show that we may take$c = 2 \text{in this}$ last result.
Summarizing, if this generalized Riemann hypothesis holds, and if the strong Fermat congruence holds for every positive integer a ⩽ 2(. og n)2, then n is prime. So, provided that a famous unproved hypoth-esis in another field of mathematics is correct, one can decide in polynomial time, via a deterministic algorithm, whether tempting to use nth is conditional test, for if it should is prime or composite.
(It has been ever lie to you and tell you that a particular compos-ite number is prime, then this failure—if you were able to detect it—would be a disproof of one of the most famous conjectures in mathematics. Perhaps this is nottoo disastrous a failure!) tinually challenging us was whether it is possible totest for primality in polynomial time with out assuming After Miller’s test in the 1970 s, the question con unproved hypotheses. Recently, Agrawal et al. (2004)answered this question with a resounding yes.
Their idea begins with a combination of the binomial theo-rem and Fermat’s little theorem. Given an integer a, consider the polynomial(x + a)n and expand it in the usual way through the binomial theorem. Each inter me-diate term between the leading xn and the trailing an has the coefficient1 and$n - 1$. If nis prime, then this coefficient, which$n$!$/(j$!(n - j)!) for some j between is an integer, is divisible byn because n appears as a factor in the numerator that is not canceled by any factors in the denominator. That is, the coefficient is

0(mod n). For example, (x + 1)7 is equal tox7 + 7 x6 + 21 x5 + 35 x4 + 35 x3 + 21 x2 + 7 x + 1, and we see each internal coefficient is a multiple of 7.Thus, we have(x + 1)7 ≡ x7 + 1 (mod 7). (Two poly- nomials are congruent mod cie nts are congruent modn.) In general, ifnif corresponding coeffi-n is prime and idea and Fermat’s little theorem we havea is any integer, then via this binomial-theorem(x + a)n ≡ xn + an ≡ xn + a (mod n). It is an easy exercise to show that this congruence in the simple casea = 1 is actually equivalent to primality.
But as with the Wilson criterion we know no way of quickly verifying that all these coefficients are indeed divisible by However, one can do more with polynomials thann. raise them to powers. We can also divide one polynomial by another to find a quotient and a remain-der, just as we do with integers. It makes sense, for example, to say thatg(x) ≡ h(x) (mod f (x)), mean- ing that when divided byg(x) andf (x)h(x). We will write leave the same remainderg(x) ≡ h(x)(mod n, f (x)) if the remainders upon division by f (x) are congruent mod ri thm for integer congruences, we can quickly com put en.
As with the powermod algo-g(x)n (mod n, f (x)), provided the degree of f (x) is not too big. This is exactly what Agrawal et al. propose. They have an auxiliary polynomialf (x) of not-too-high degree such that, if

(x + a)n ≡ xn + a (mod n, f (x)) for each$a = 1$, 2, . . . , B, for a not-too-high bound B, then certain composites that are easily recognized as com-n must be in a set that contains the primes and posit es. (Not all composites are hard to recognize assuch, e.g., any number with a small prime factor is easy to recognize.) These ideas put together form the pri-mality test of Agrawal et al. To give the argument in full detail one has to specify the auxiliary polynomialf (x) that is used and what the bound B is, and one has to prove rigorously that it is exactly the primes which pass the test.

We did this by expand- formxr -1: in particular we used polynomials that are related to Gauss’s famous algorithm for construction of certain regularn-gons with straightedge and compass (seeisfying to us to bring in a famous tool of Gauss to say algebraic numbers [IV.1 §13](/part-04/number-theory)). It was indeed sat something about his problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers. Are the new polynomial-time primality tests good in practice?
So far, the answer is no, the competition isjust too tough. For example, using the arithmetic of elliptic curves proofs of primality for huge numbers. This algorithm[III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) we can come up with bona fide is conjectured to run in polynomial time but we have not even proved that it always terminates. If, at the end of the day, or in this case the end of the run, we have alegitimate proof, then perhaps we can tolerate the situation of not being sure that it would work out when we started!
The method, pioneered by Atkin and Morain, has recently proved the primality of a number that has over 20 000 decimal digits, and is not of some special form such as 2 n - 1 that makes testing for primality easier. The record for the new breed of polynomial-time tests is a measly 300 digits. faster primality tests. Mersenne primes comprise the most famous of these forms; these are primes that are For numbers of certain special forms there are much 1 less than a power of 2. It is suspected that there are infinitely many examples, but we seem to be very far from a proof of this.
Just forty-three Mersenne primes are known, the record example being 230 402 457- 1, a prime with more than 9 For much more on primality testing, and for ref-.15 million decimal digits. erences to various other sources, see Crandall and Pomerance (2005). 3 Factoring Composite Numbers Compared with what we know about testing primality, our ability to factor large numbers is still in the dark ages. In fact this imbalance between the two problems forms the bulwark for the security of electronic commerce on the Internet.
(See mathematics and cryptography important application of mathematics, but also an odd[VII.7](/part-07/mathematics-and-cryptography) for an account of why.) This is a very one, and not something to brag about, since it depends on the in ability of mathematicians to efficiently solve a basic problem!Nevertheless, we do have our tricks. Part of the landscape is euclid’s algorithm [III.22] for computing the

Butm and n, one should find all of their divi Euclid’s algorithm is much more efficient: the number of arithmetic steps is bounded by the logarithm of the smaller number, so not only does it run in polynomialtime, it is in fact quite speedy.
So, if we can build up a special num berm that may be likely to have a nontrivial factor in common withwe can use Euclid’s algorithm to discover this factor.n, For example, Pollard and Strassen (independently) used this idea, together with fast subroutines for multiplication and polynomial evaluation, to enhance the trial division method discussed in the last section.
Some-what miraculously, one can take the integers up to(n1()/){2}, break them inton1/4 subintervals of length n1/4, and for each subinterval calculate the GCD ofn with the product of all the integers in the subinterval, spending only about(n1()/){4} elementary steps in total. If n is com- posite, then at least one GCD will be larger than 1, and then a search over the first such subinterval will locate a nontrivial factor of fastest rigorous and deterministic method of factoringn. To date, this algorithm is the that we know.
unproved but reasonable-seeming hypotheses about Most practical factoring algorithms are based on the natural numbers. Although we may not know howto prove rigorously that these methods will always produce a factorization, or do so quickly, in practice theydo. This situation resembles the experimental sciences, where hypotheses are tested against experiments. Our experience with certain factoring algorithms is now so overwhelming that a scientist might claim that a physical law is involved.
As mathematicians, we still search for proof, but fortunately the numbers we factor do not feel the need to wait for us. school years: factor 8051. The trick is to notice that8051 I often mention a contest problem from my high$= 902 - 72 = (90 - 7)(90 + 7)$, from which the factorization 83·97 can be read off. In fact every odd composite can be factored as the difference oftwo squares, an idea that goes back to fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665).
Indeed, ifu = 1(a + nb)has the nontrivial factorization and v = 1 (a - b)$, \text{so that nab}=$, then letu2 - v2, andifn ahas a divisor very close to2 = u + v, b = u - v2.

My quadratic sieve method (which follows work of For example, take wi thj = 41, and consider the num be rsn = 1649. We start just abovej2 - 1649.
Asn1/2 j runs, we will eventually hit a value where j2 - 1649 isa square, and so be able to use Fermat’s method. Let’stry it: 412- 1649 = 32,$422$- 1649 = 115,$432$- 1649 = 200,.. . Well, no squares yet, which is not surprising, since the Fermat method is often very poor. But wait, do the first and third lines not multiply together to give a square? Yes they do, 32$· 200 = 80^{2}$. So, multiplying the first and third lines, and treating them as congruences mod 1649, we have

$(41 · 43)2 ≡ 802 (mod 1649)$.

That is, we have a pair This is not quite the same as havingu, v with u2 u≡2 - v(v2)2(mod 1649 = 1649, but). we do have 1649 a divisor of$u2 - v2 = (u - v)(u + v)$. Now maybe 1649 divides one of these factors, but if it does not, then it is split between them, and so a computation of the GCD of u - v (or u + v) with1649 will reveal a proper factor. Now$u = 41· 43 ≡ 114 (mod 1649)$, and so we see instant lyv = 80 and that GCD of 114 u ≡ ±v (-80 mod 1649 = 34 with 1649 is 17. Dividing, we see), so we are in business. The$that 1649$= 17 · 97, and we are done. Can we generalize this?
In trying to factor$n = 1649$ we considered consecutive values of the quadratic poly-nomialf (j) = j2 - n for j starting just above . qrt{n}, and viewed these as congruences we found a set M of numbersj2 j ≡withf (j) (modf (j)n). Then equal to a square, say$u^{2} ≡ v^{2} (mod n)v$. Since2. We then letu ≡ ±v (u =modj^∈Mj^∈Mn), we couldj, so that splitn via the GCD of u - v and n. small example with form our square, but we ignored 115. If we had thought There is another lesson that we can learn from ourn = 1649.
We used 32 and 200 to about it, we might have noticed from the start that 32 and 200 were more likely to be useful than 115. The reason is that 32 and 200 areing that they have only small prime factors), while 115 smooth numbers (meanis not smooth, having the relatively large prime factor23. Say you havek + 1 positive integers that involve IV. Branches of Mathematics in their prime factorizations only the first It is an easy theorem that some nonempty subset ofk primes. these numbers has product a square.

Since squares are detected by al(l1()2)k nentsa are odd or even. Thus, we think of these vec-i

Since we have$k + 1 vectors$, each with only leads quickly to a nonempty subset that adds up to thek coordinates, an easy matrix calculation 0-vector. The product of the corresponding integers isthen a square.

square. In addition, the “sieve” in the quadratic sieve comes in with the search for smooth values of f (j) = j2 - n. These numbers are the consecutive values of a (quad-ratic) polynomial, so those divisible by a given prime can be found in regular places in the sequence. For example, in our illustration,$j^{2} - 1649 \text{is divisible by} 5$ precisely when$j ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 5)$. A sieve very much like the sieve of Eratosthenes can then be used to effi-ciently find the special numbers$j where j^{2} - n is$ smooth.
A key issue, though, is how smooth a valuef (j) has to be for us to decide to accept it. If we choose a smaller bound for the primes involved, we do not have to find all that many of them to use the matrix method. But such very smooth values might be very rare. If we use a larger bound for the primes involved, then smooth values off (j) may be more common, but we will need many of them. Some where between smaller and larger is just right! In order to make the choice, it would help to know how frequently values of an irreducible quadratic polynomial are smooth.
Unfor-tunately, we do not have a theorem that tells us, but we

can still make a good choice by assuming that this fre-quency is about that for a random number of the same size, an assumption that is probably correct even if itis hard to prove. Finally, note that if the final GCD yields only a trivial factor with more linear dependencies, each with a fresh chance at$n$, one can continue just a bit longer and find splittingn. These thoughts lead us to a time bound of about

(It is random in the sense that a coin is flipped at various junctures, and decisions on what to do next depend on the out comes of these flips.
Through this process, we expect to get a bona fide factorization within the advertised time bound.) However, the method is not so computer practical, and ifyou had to choose in practice between the two, then you should go with the nonrigorous quadratic sieve. Atriumph for the quadratic sieve was the 1994 factorization of the 129-digit RSA cryptographic challenge first published in Martin Gardner’s column in Scientific American The number field sieve in 1977.
, which is another sieve-based factoring algorithm, was discovered in the late 1980 sby Pollard for integers close to powers, and later developed by Buhler, Lenstra, and me for general integers. The method is similar in spirit to the quadratic sieve, but assembles its squares from the product of certain sets of algebraic integers. The number field sieve has a conjectured time complexity of the type . xp (c(. og n()1()/){3}(log log n()2()/){3}), for a value ofc slightly below 2.
For composite numbers beyond 100 digits or so that have no small prime factor, it is the method of choice, with the current record being 200 decimal digits. property that if you use them, then all composite num-bers of about the same size are equally hard to factor. The sieve-based factorization methods share the For instance, factoringis a product of five primes each roughly near the fifthnwill be about as difficult ifn 355 root of roughly near the square root ofn as it will be if n is a product of two primesn.
This is quite unlike trial division, which is happiest when there is a small prime factor. We will now describe a famous factorization method due to Lenstra that detects small prime factors before large ones, and beyond baby cases is much superior to trial dividing. This is his method. elliptic curve Just as the quadratic sieve searches for a number mcurve method.

 with imagine that if Choosing random num be rsn can also have instant success, but you can welln has no small prime factors, then them and testing their GCD expected time for success would be enormous. Instead, the elliptic curve method involves considerably more cleverness. Consider first the “p - 1 method” of Pollard. Suppose you have a number large numberk. Unbeknownst to you, n you wish to factor and a cer ta inn has a prime factor factorqp withwithqp--1 not a divisor of1 a divisor of k, and another primek.

But ifn has no prime factors p with p - 1 smooth, Pollard’s method fares poorly. prime the What is going on here is that corresponding to thep - p1 nonzero residues modwe have the multiplica tiv ep.

There is one additional “point at infin(but not as simple as adding coordinatewise!) makes the elliptic curve into a group, with the point at infinityas the identity (see rational points on curves and the mordell conjecture later generalized by weil [VI.93](/part-06/andr-weil-19061998) with his famous proof[V.29](/part-05/rational-points-on-curves-and-vi40-ernst-eduard-kummer-18101893)).
Hasse, in a result of the “Riemann hypothesis for curves,” showed us that the number of elements in the elliptic curve group always lies between$p + 1 - 2 \sqrt{p} and p + 1 + 2 \sqrt{p} (see$ the weil conjectures that every number in this range is indeed associated[V.35](/part-05/the-weil-conjectures))).

As you can plainly see, Gauss’s guess is right on the money! numerical methods for integration, and it is directly The numerical computation of li(x) is simple via obtainable in various mathematics computing pack-ages. However, the computation of$π(10^{2}2) (\text{due to}$ Gourdon) is far from trivial. It would be far too labo-rious to count these approximately 2$\times 10^{2}0 primes$ one by one, so how are they counted? In fact, we have various combinatorial tricks to count with out listing everything.
For example, one does not need to count one by one to see that there are exactly 2$[10^{2}2/6] + 1$ integers in the interval from 1 to 1022 that are relatively prime to 6. Rather, one thinks of these numbers grouped in blocks of six, with two in each block coprime to 6. (The “$+$1” comes from the partial block at the end.) Building on early ideas of Meissel and Lehmer, Lagarias, Miller, and Odlyzko presented an elegant combinato-rial method for computingπ(x) that takes about (x2()/){3} elementary steps.
The method was refined by Delégliseand Rivat, and then Gourdon found a way to distribute the computation to many computers. From work of von Koch, and later Schoenfeld, we know that the Riemann hypothesis isassertion that equivalent to the

If we know for other reasons that.7, and at least one zero between 1 f has exactly.7 two zeros, then we have accounted for both of them.

In order to discuss this question, it is very convenient to “normalize” the spacings, so that the average (normalized) gap between consecutive zeros is 1. By Riemann’s result, together with our assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, this can be done ifwe multiply a gap near$T by (1/2π) \log T$, or, equiv- alently, if for each zero par tt = Im ρ by (1/2π)tρ. og we replace its imaginaryt.

These zeta zeros are[III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions), such as Poisson, Gaussian, etc. not random at all, but perhaps thinking in terms of randomness has promise.

great conjectures about the zeta function, and will not lead to great theorems. But then again, who can deny the power of a glimpse at the truth? We await the next chapter in this development. 5 Diophantine Equations and the ABC Conjecture Let us move now from the Riemann hypothesis tomat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem). Until the last decade it fer too was one of the most famous unsolved problemsin mathematics, once even having a mention on an episode oftionxn + y Star Trekn = zn has no solutions in positive inte-.
The assertion is that the equa- gersx, y, z, n, where n ⩾ 3.
 This conjecture had remained unproved for three and a half centuries until Andrew Wiles published a proof in 1995. In addition, perhaps more important than the solution of this particular Diophantine equation (that is, an equation where the unknowns are restricted to the integers), the centuries-long quest for a proof helped establish the field ofthe proof itself established a long-sought and wonder-algebraic number theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory). And ful connection between elliptic curves.
modular forms [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms) and That is, just in case you are not an expert on all of the But do you know why Fermat’s last theorem is true? intricacies of the proof, are you surprised that there are in fact no solutions? In fact, there is a fairly simple heuristic argument that supports the assertion. First note that the casen = 3, namely x3 + y3 = z3, can be handled by elementary methods, and this in fact had already been done by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783). So, let us focus on the cases when powers of integers.
How likely is it that the sum of twon ⩾ 4.1 Let Sn be the set of positive nth members ofall likely, since Wiles has proved that this never occurs!Sn is itself a member of Sn? Well, not at But recall that we are trying to think naively. Sn Let us try to mimic our situation by replacing the set with a random set. In fact, we will throw all of the powers together into one set. Following an idea of Erd ̋and Ulam (1971) we create a set Rby a random process: os each integer chance it gets thrown intom is considered independently, and the R is proportional to (m - 3()/){4}.
This process would typically give us aboutx1/4 num- bers in R in the interval [1, x], or at least this would be the order of magnitude. Now the total number of fourth and higher powers between 1 andx is also about x1/4, but we ignore this.1. Actually, Fermat himself had a simple proof in the case n = 4,

360

so we can take our random set R as modeling the sit- uation for these powers, namely the union of all sets S for n ⩾ 4. We ask how likely it is to have a + b = c wheren a, b, and c all come from R. astional to The probability that a number a + b with 0 < a < b < m(a-3()/){4}(m -anda)m-3 may be represented a, (b/)4, since for each∈ R is propor-a less than R is a-3/4 m(m0<a<m/the probability that - a)-2 3/4. Actually, there is a minor caveat a and m -a both lie in whento cover this, we add the single termm is even, since then a = m - a(1 whenm)-3(a/)4=to th(e1)2 m: above sum.
Replacing eachwe get a larger sum that is easy to estimate and turnsm - a in the sum wit(h2()1)2 m, out to be proportional to(m-1()/){2}. That is, the chance that a random number R is at most a certain quantity that is proportional tom is a sum of two members ofm-1/2. Now the events that would have to occur formthanto be given as such a sum involve numbers small erm, so the event that m itself is in R is indepen- dent of these.
Therefore, the probability that only the sum of two members of R, but also itself am is not member of(m-1()/){2}(m-3()/){4}R=, is at most a quantity proportional to(m-5()/){4}. So now we can count how many times we should expect a sum of two members of itself be a member of R. This is at most a constant times R tom-5/4. But this sum is convergent, so we expect only finitely many examples. Further, since the tail ofa convergent series is tiny, we do not expect any large m examples. Thus, this argument suggests that there are at most finitely many positive integer solutions to

$x^{u} + y^{v} = z^{w}$, (2)

where the exponents mat’s last theorem is the special case whenu, v, w are at least 4. Since Fer-u = v = w, we would have at most finitely many counterexamples to that as well. There are actually This seems tidy enough, but now we get a surprise!infinitely many solutions to (2) in positive integers with note that 174+344 u=, 17 v,5 w. This is the case all at least 4. For example, a = 1, b = 2, ugers, and=4 of a more general identity: ifc = au + bu, we have (ac)a, bu are positive inte-+ (bc)u = (cu)+1.
Another way to get infinitely many examples is to build on the possible existence of just one example. Ifx, y, zthe same exponents, we may replace, u, v , w are positive integers satisfying (2), then withx, y , z with a^vw x, a^uw y , a^uvz for any integer a, and so get infinitely many solutions.

One simple way So how do we neatly bar these trivialities and come to to do this is to insist that the numbers relatively prime.
This gives no restriction whatsoever inx, y, z in (2) be the Fermat case of equal exponents, since a solution toxn +yn = zn with d the greatest common divisor of x, y(z/d), z leads to the coprime solutio nn$. (x/d)n + (y/d)n =$ Concerning Fermat’s last theorem, one might ask how far it had actually been verified before the final proof by Wiles. The paper by Buhler et al. (1993) reports a verification for all exponents type of calculation, which is far from trivial, has itsn up to 4 000 000. This roots in nineteenth-century work of kummer [VI.40] and early-twentieth-century work of Vandiver.
In fact, Buhler et al. (1993) also verify in the same range a related conjecture of Vandiver dealing with cyclo-tomic fields, but this conjecture may in fact be false in general. The probabilistic thinking above, combined with computation of small cases, can carry us deeply into some very provocative conjectures. The above probabilistic argument can easily be extended to suggest that (2) has at most finitely many relatively prime solutio nsw with 1 x, y/u, z+over all possible exponent triples1/v + 1/w < 1.
This conjecture hasu, v , come to be known as the Fermat–Catalan conjecture, since it contains within it essentially Fermat’s last theorem and also the Catalan conjecture (recently proved by Mih ̆a ilescu) that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers. there are topic of computing comes in. For example, since 1 It is good that we do allow for the possibility that some solutions, and this is where our main$+8 =$ 9, we have a solution toy = 2, and z = 3.
(The exponent 7 is chosen to insurex7 + y3 = z2$, where x = 1$, that the reciprocal sum of the exponents is less than 1.Of course, we could replace 7 by any larger integer, but since in each case the power involved is the number 1, they should all together be considered as just one example.)

Using results from a famous paper of Faltings, However, for particular choices ofu, v, w, more can Darmon and Granville (1995) have shown that for any fixed choice ofu, v, w with reciprocal sum at most 1, there are at most finitely many coprime triples$z solving (2)$. For a particular choice of exponents, onex, y, might try to actually find all of the solutions.
If it can be handled at all, this task can involve a delicate inter-play between arithmetic geometry [IV.5](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry), effective methods in transcendental number theory, and good hard computing.

It involves positive integer solu-tions to the equation the abc conjecture$a +$[V.1](/part-05/the-abc-conjecture) of Oesterlé and Masser$b = c$, hence the name. To put some meaning into$a + b = c$, we define the radical of a nonzero integern as the product of the primes that divide ple, rad(10)n=, denoting this as rad10, rad(72) = 6, and rad(n). So, for exam-(65 536) = 2. In particular, high powers have small radicals in comparison to the number itself, and so do many other numbers. Basically, the ABC conjecture asserts that if a + b = c, then the radical of abc cannot be too small.
More specifically we have the following. The ABC conjecture.

These ideas, which lead to a Basic to this argument is a perfectly rigorous res ultn for which rad(n) more explicit version of the ABC conjecture, are worked through in the thesis of van Frankenhuijsen and by Stewart and Tenenbaum.

The condition that the terms be relatively prime now takes on two possible meanings: pairwise relatively prime or no nontrivial common divisor of all four numbers. The first condition seems morein the spirit of the three-term conjecture, but may be a tad too strong in that it disallows using any even num-bers. So say we take the four terms with no pair having a common factor greater than 2.
Under this condition, our heuristics seem to suggest that for eachε > 0, we have rad(abcd()1()+){ε} < . ax \\{|a|}, |b|,|c|,|d|\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} (4) for at most finitely many cases. But consider the poly-nomial identity (x + 1)5 = (x - 1)5 + 10(x2 + 1)2 - 8 (suggested to me by Granville). If we take tip le of 10, the four terms involved in the identity arex as a mul- pairwise relatively prime except for the last two, which have a common factor of 2. Let x = 11 k - 1, which isa multiple of 10.
The largest of the four terms is 115 k, and the radical of the product of the four terms is at most 110$(11 k - 2)((11 k - 1)2 + 1) < 110 · 1(13)k$.

Other examples include the twin prime conjec-ture (there are infinitely many prime sp such that p + 2 is prime), Goldbach’s conjecture (every even number larger than 2 is the sum of two primes), and count less other conjectures in number theory. Often the computational evidence for the probabilistic view is striking, IV. Branches of Mathematics even overwhelming, and we become convinced of the truth of our model. But on the other hand, if it is this pseudo-proof that is all we have to go on, we may still be very far from the truth.
Nevertheless, the interplay of computations and heuristic thinking forms an indispensable part of our arsenal, and mathematics is the richer for it.

Algebraic Geometry IV.4 Algebraic Geometry János Kollár 1 Introduction Succinctly put, algebraic geometry is the study of geom-etry using polynomials and the investigation of polynomials using geometry. Many of us were taught the beginnings of algebraic geometry in high school, under the name “analytic geometry.” When we say thaty = mx + b is the equa- tion of a line L, or that x2 + y2 = r2 describes a circle C of radiu sr , we establish a basic connection between geometry and algebra. If we want to find the points where the line L and the circley in the circle equation to get C intersect, we
just substitutex2 + (mxmx + b)+2 b = forr2 and solve the resulting quadratic equation to obtain the x This simple example encapsulates the method of coordinates of the two intersection points. algebraic geometry: a geometric problem is translated into algebra, where it is readily solvable; conversely, we get insight into algebra problems by using geometry. It is hard to guess the solutions of systems of polynomial equations, but once a corresponding geometric picture is drawn, we start to have a qualitative understanding of them. The precise quantitative answer is then provided by algebra.
2 Polynomials and Their Geometry Polynomials are the expressions one can put together from variables and numbers by addition and multiplication. The most familiar are one-variable polynomials such asx3 - x + 4, but we can use two or three vari- ables to get, for instance, 2 x5 - 3 xy2 + y3 (which has degree 5 in two variables) or x5 - y7 + x2 z8 - xyz + 1(which has degree 10 in three variables). In general, onecan usen variables, in which case they are frequently denoted by$x^{1}$, x2, . . . , xn, and we write f (x1, . . .

(Although your pocket calculator is likely to have a button for logarithms, it is secretly computing a polynomial whose value at a number with logb up to many decimal places.) b agrees for the linex2 We can slightly rewrite the equations we gave earlier + y2 - r2 L=and the circle0. We can then describe C: as$y - mx L and - b C = as0 andzero$363 Figure 1 A hyperboloid intersecting a plane. sets all points:
L is the zero set of(x, y) such thaty y--mxmx--bb(that is, the set of = 0) and C is the zero set ofx2 + y2 - r2. Similarly, the zero set of 2 x2 + 3 y2 - z2 - 7 in 3 - space is a hyperboloid, the zero set ofz - x - y in 3 - space is a plane, and the common zero set of these two equationsin 3-space is the intersection of the hyperboloid and the plane, which is an ellipse (see figure 1). The set of common zeros of a system of polynomial equations in any number of variables is called analgebraic set. These are the basic objects of algebraic geometry.
few have a feeling for 4-space, also called and 5-space is by and large inconceivable to almost Most people feel that geometry ends in 3-space. Very space-time, every one. So what is the meaning of geometry in many variables? Algebra comes to our rescue here. While I have great difficulty visualizing what a four-dimensional sphere ofradiusr in 5-space should be, I can easily write down its equation,(x2)1 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 + (x2)4 + (x5)2 - r2 = 0, and work with it. This equation is also something a computer can handle, which is immensely useful in applications. for the rest of this article.
This is where all geometry I will, nonetheless, stick to two or three variables starts and there are plenty of interesting questions and results. The importance of algebraic geometry derives from the fact that significant interactions between algebra 364 and geometry happen very frequently. Let us look attwo examples, just for illustration. 3 Most Shapes Are Algebraic Shapes that occur frequently enough to have their own name, for instance, lines, planes, circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, hyperboloids, paraboloids, ellipsoids, are almost all algebraic.
Even the more esoteric conchoid (or shell curve) of Dürer, the trident of[VI.14](/part - 06/isaac - newton - 16421727), and the folium of Kepler are algebraic.newton Some shapes cannot be described by polynomial equations, but they can be described by polynomial inequalities. For instance, the inequalities 0⩽ x ⩽ a and 0⩽ y ⩽ b together describe a rectangle with side lengths it i es are called a, b. Shapes described by polynomial in equal-semialgebraic, and every polyhedron is semialgebraic. example, at the graph of the sine function This crosses the Not everything is an algebraic set, though.

Let M be any manifold in Rn. Fix any large number zero set is as close to R. Then there is a polynomial M as we want, at least inside af whose ball of radius R around the origin.
4 Codes and Finite Geometries Consider the equationx2 + y2 = z2, which describes a double cone in 3 - space (see figure 4). If we confine ourselves to natural numbers, then the solutions of x2 + y2 = z2 are the Pythagorean triples, correspond- ing to right-angled triangles where all sides have inte-ger lengths, of which the two best-known examples are

we care only about the whether they are even or odd). For instance, 3 Let us now look at the same equation, but declare that parities of the two sides (that is,2+152 and4 The parities of2 are both even, so we say that 3 x2 + y2 and of (z2)2 depend only on those + 152 ≡ 42 (mod 2). of either 0 (the even case) or 1 (the odd case). Our equationx, y , and z, so we can pretend that x, y , and z are all modulo 2 therefore has four solutions: 000, 011, 101, 110.
These look like code words in a computer message. It was quite a surprise when it was discovered that using polynomials and their solutions modulo 2 is a great—probably the best—way of constructing correcting codes [[VII.6 §§3–5]](/part - 07/reliable - transmission - of - information). error ing here. Let us think for a moment about what 3-space is for us.

(For instance, the intersection points with the$x - \text{axis are} (±\sqrt{R}$, 0).) solutions ofcan also look for solutions in the “plane modulo If R is a rational number, we can ask about rationalx2 + y2 = R, and if R is an integer, wem” for any One can even look for solutions where m. x = x(t), y = y(t) are themselves polynomials in a variable t.
(Most generally, we can ask for solutions where are elements of any ring containing the number Rx.), y each time we look at solution sets we are taking a “snap-To my mind, the polynomial is the central object, and shot” of the polynomial. Some snapshots are good (like the above real snapshot for R > 0) and some are bad (like the above real snapshot for How good can snapshots be? Can we determine a$R < 0)$. polynomial from its snapshots? bola, but “an” equation would be more correct.
Indeed, the hyperbola One frequently talks about “the” equation of a hyper-x2 - y2 - R = 0 can also be given by an equationcx2 - cy2 - c R = 0, for any c ≠ 0. We can also use the equation(x2 - y2 - R)2 = 0, which we may well not recognize in its expanded form. Higher powers can also be used. What about the equation$f$ (x$, y) =(x^{2} - y^{2} - R)(x^{2} + y^{2} + R^{2}) =$0? If we look only at real solutions, this is still just the hyperbola sincex2 + y2 + R2 is always positive for x, y real.
However, as with one-variable polynomials, one should look at all complex roots to understand everything. Then we see thatis not on the hyperbola$f (\sqrt{-1R}$, 0) = 0, but the complex pointx2 - y2 - R = 0. In general,(. qrt{-1 R},0) as long ashas exactly the same complex roots as R . eq 0, we get that if f is a polynomial thatx2 - y2 - R, thenf (x, y) = c(x2 - y2 - R)m for some m andc . eq Why is the0. R = 0 case different?
The reason is that for R . eq 0 the polynomial x2 - y2 - R is irreducible (that is, it cannot be written as the product of other polyno - mials), while$x^{2} - y^{2} = (x + y)(x - y) \text{is reducible}$ with irreducible factorsx + y and x - y.

What happens with a syst emg(x$, y) =$0? Geometrically we see two curves in the$f$ (x$, y) =$ plane, so we expect that there will typically be finitely many intersection points. These usually intersect in a single point, but they canbe parallel and they can coincide.

It is some what tech-nical so we shall skip it here, but it is indispensable even at the most basic level.)Next, consider two polynomials of degree 2, that is, two plane conics.
Two smooth conics usually intersectin at most four points (just try this by drawing two ellipses). There are also some rather degenerate cases. Two conics may coincide, or, if they are both reducible, they can have a common line. In any case, we are ready to formulate a basic result, dating back to 1779.

Evenin very degenerate situations it is possible to define and count the multiplicities easily. This is frequently of great help since the typical (or “generic”) cases are usually very hard to compute.

It is easy to see that neither the plane nor the line can be written as the union of algebraic sets (except by nitpickers who point out that the line is the union of the line itself and of any point on the line). In general, any algebraic set can be written in exactly one way as the union of smaller algebraic sets that in turn cannot be decomposed further. These basic building blocks are called irreducible algebraic sets or algebraic varieties.

Some times this is not exactly what one would naively expect. For instance, the curve in figure 2 has two con-nected components. The two parts are, however, not algebraic sets. An explanation is provided by looking at the complex solutions of this equation. We shall see later that these form a connected set, namely a torus (with a miss-ing point at infinity). We see two components when we look at the real solutions because we are taking across-section of this torus.
In general, the zero setf = 0 is irreducible as an alge- braic set if and only iff is irreducible as a polynomial (or if it is the power of an irreducible polynomial). the implication in one direction is easy to see: if$f = gh$, then the zero set ofand of the zero set off his the union of the zero set of. g For many questions, keeping track only of the zero set is not enough. For instance, look at the polynomialf = x2(x - 1)(x - 2)3. It has degree 6 and three roots atand one usually says that$x = 0$,1,$2$.
These roots behave differently, however, f has a double root at x = 0 and a triple root atx = 2. If we perturb f by adding a small numberf (x) + = 0 has two (complex) solutions near 0, oneto it, then the perturbed equation solution near 1 and three (complex) solutions near 2.Thus, these multiplicities carry important geometric meaning about the perturbation of the equation. Similarly, it is natural to say that while$x2y = 0 andxy3 =$0 define the same algebraic set (consisting of the two axes), the first “assigns multiplicity 2” to theand the other “assigns multiplicity 3” to thex-axis.y-axis

a further difference. In the first case the multiplicity seems to “go in they-direction” and in the second case it seems to go in the other systems, likex -x-direction. We can also look atcy = y3 = 0, if we want to see more complicated behavior. Roughly speaking, a scheme is an algebraic set where we also keep track of the multiplicities and of the directions they occur in. Consider thexy-plane and consider the map that reflects across the origin. Thus a point to(-x, -y). Let us try to glue each point(x, y)(x, y)is mapped to its image(-x,-y). What do we get?
The right half-plane x ⩾ 0 is mapped to the left half-plane x ⩽ 0, so it is enough to work out what happens with the right half-plane. The positivey-axis is glued to the negative y- axis, and the resulting surface is a dunce cap (but less pointy). Algebraically, it is one half of the cone$z^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$. This cone looks nice and smooth except at the ver-tex. There it is more complicated, but the above construction shows that it can be obtained from a plane by a reflection across a point. More generally, suppose we take then-dimensional space Rnand finitely many symmetries of it.
If we glue together points that move into each other, we again get an algebraic variety, most of whose points are smooth, but some of which are more complicated.

The study of stacks is strongly re com earlier times.
8 Curves, Surfaces, Threefolds As with any geometric object, one of the simplest ques-tions one can ask about a variety is: what is its dimension? As expected, a curve in the plane has dimen-sion 1, and a surface in 3-space has dimension 2. This seems quite simple until one writes down examples like$S = (x4 + y4 + z4 = 0)$, which is only the origin in R3. This example is, nonetheless, still two dimensional: the explanation is that we were looking at the wrong snapshot.
Using complex numbers we can solve the equa-tion as$z = {}^{4} - x^{4} - y^{4}$, so the complex solutions ofx4 + y4 + z4 = 0 can be described by two indepen- dent variablesit is quite reasonable to say thatx, y and a dependent variable S is two dimensional.z. Thus,

This is a much more complicated theory than for curves. Still very little is known for varieties of dimension 3 and up. At least conjecturally, all these dimensions behave in roughly the same way. Despite some progress, especially in dimension 3, many questions are wide open. 9 Singularities and Their Resolutions If we look at the simplest examples of algebraic curves in figure 3, we see that most points of a curve are smooth, but that there may be a finite set of more complicated singular points. Let us compare these with the curve in figure 2. equation has no constant term.

Let us start with singularities of hypersurfaces, or equivalently with thinking about these it is natural to work not just with critical points of functions. When polynomials but with more general power series, thatis, functionsf (x , . . . , x )that can be written as “polynomials of infinite degree.” For simplicity of notationwe shall assume that1$f (n0) = 0$.
Two functions f , g are considered to be change$x \to φ (x)$, where each equivalent if there is a coordinateφ is given by a power series, such that$i^{i} f (φ^{1}(x)$, $. . . , φn(ix)) = g(x)$. In the one-variable case, anyf can be written asf = xm(am + (am)+1 x + · · · ), where am . eq 0. The (inverse of the) substitution. qrtx \to xm am + (am)+1 x + · · · then shows thatf is equivalent to xm.

In the(u, v, w)-space consider the smooth cylinderu2 + v2 = 1. The map (u, v, w) \to  (uw, vw, w) maps the cylinder onto the cone (see figure 4).

Such integers are called The first step is to define some integers, naturally discrete invariants The second is to show that the set of all varieties. The simplest example is the dimension.

More over, we would like the variety used for this parametrization to be chosen as economically as pos - sible. We will look at this in more detail in the next section. Let us see how it is accomplished for curves. Here there is only one more discrete invariant be sides the dimension, known as thehas many different definitions: one of the simplest is genus of the curve. This through topology. Let look at its complex points.
Locally, this set looks like E be a smooth curve and let us C, so it is a topological surface. After patching up some holes at infinity, we get a compact surface. Multiplica-tion by. qrt{-1} gives an orientation, so basic topology tells us that we get a sphere with a certain number of han-dles attached (see differential topology [IV.7](/part - 04/dierential - topology)). The genus of the curve is defined to be the number of these handles (that is, the genus of the corresponding sur - face).
To see what this means in practice, let us look at some examples. A line in 2-space is like the complex numbers, which can be viewed as a sphere minus a point. This sphere, C plus the point at infinity, is also called the Riemann sphere Next, we look at conics. Here it is better to use some. So the genus is zero. projective geometry. Take any tangent of the conic and move this so that it becomes the line at infinity. Then we get a parabola, which, in suitable coordinates, is given by an equation$y = x2$.
The polynomial map t \to  (t$, t2)$, with its inverse(x, y) \to  x, shows that this parabola is isomorphic to a line, so again has genus 0. ing is that smooth (and has genus 0) but it is singular at infinity. Cubics are quite a bit more complicated. A first warn-y = x3 is the wrong cubic to look at. It is (The earlier expediency of keeping silent about projec-tive geometry starts to bite us!) In any case, the correct thing to do is to choose the tangent line of the cubic at an inflection point and move that to infinity. After some computation we obtain a much-simplified

This can be seen through more-complicated representations. One can continue in this manner a bit longer, up to about genus 10, but no such explicit construction ispossible when the genus is large. 11 Moduli Spaces Let us go back to plane cubics, which we parametrized by the vector space V of degree - 3 polynomials in two variables.

Further more, there is not much reason to distinguish$x^{3} + 2y^{3} + 1 from$ 2 x3 + y3 + 1, since they are obtained from each other by switching the two coordinate axes. More generally, as we have seen in the previous section, any cubic curve can be transformed into one given by an equation$y^{2} = f (x)$, where f = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. two more steps to take.

The most exciting and profound developments arise from the discovery of new connec - tions. We have seen hints of some of these; many more were left unmentioned. Born with Cartesian coordin - ates, algebraic geometry is now intertwined with coding theory, number theory, computer-aided geometric design, and theoretical physics. Several of these con-nections have emerged in the last decade, and I hope to see many more in the future. Further Reading Most of the algebraic geometry literature is very tech - nical.

such thata, b, c, and n are integers. Our original equation (1) now becomes na2 + nb2 = 7 nc2,

and multiplying through by$n2 \text{one hasa}2 + b2 = 7c2$. (2)

If replace them bya, b, and c have a common factora/m, b/m, and c/m, and (2) still holdsm, then we can for these new numbers. We may therefore suppose thata, b, and c are integers with no common factor. modular arithmetic reductions of We now reduce the above equation modulo 7 (seea and b modulo 7. The right-hand side of[III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic)). Denote b$\bar{y}a$ an$\bar{d}$ b the (2) is a multiple of 7, so it reduces to 0. We are left with

$a$ ̄2$+ b$ ̄2$= 0$. (3)

Now there are only seven possibilities fo$\bar{r}a$, and seven possibilities fo$\bar{r}$(3) amounts to checking the forty-nine choices o. ar{f}b. So the analysis of the solutions ofa,  ̄$b$ and seeing which ones satisfy the equation. A few min-utes of calculation are enough to convince us that (3) is satisfied only i. ar{f}But saying tha. ar{t}a a==$\bar{b}b=$ ̄=0.0 is the same as saying thataa2 andandbb2 are both multiples of 7. This being the case, are both multiples of 49. It follows that their$sum$, 7$c2$, is a multiple of 49 as well.
Therefore, c2 is a multiple of 7, and this implies that tip le of 7. In particular, a, b, and c share a com monc itself is a mul- factor of 7. We have now arrived at the desired contra-diction, since we chosea, b, and c to have no common factor. Thus, the hypothesized solution leads us to a contradiction, so we are forced to conclude that there is not, in fact, any solution to (1) consisting of nonzero rational numbers.1 a polynomial equation like (2) is called a problem In general, the determination of rational solutions to.
We were able to dispose of (2) in a paragraph, Diophantine but that turns out to be the exception: in general, Dio-phantine problems can be extraordinarily difficult. For instance, we might modify the exponents in (2) and consider the equation

$x5 + y5 = 7z5$. (4)

I do not know whether (4) has any solutions in nonzero rational numbers or not; one can be sure, though, that determining the answer would be a substantial piece of work, and it is quite possible that the most powerful techniques available to us are in sufficient to answer this simple question. More generally, one can take an arbitrary commutative mial equation has solutions inring [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)R, and ask whether a certain polyno-R. For instance, does(2) have a solution with ring C[t]? (The answer is yes.

to find some solutions.) We call the problem of solving a polynomial equation over R a Diophantine problem over cise boundary, but to a first approximation one may say R. The subject of arithmetic geometry has no pre- that it concerns the solution of Diophantine problems over subrings of number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields). (To be honest, a problem is usually called Diophantine only when R is a subring of a number field.
However, the more general definition suits our current purposes.) With any particular equation like (2), one can associate each commutative ring infinitely many Diophantine problems, one for$R$. A central insight—in some sense the basic insight—of modern algebraic geometryis that this whole gigantic ensemble of problems can be treated as a single entity. This widening of scope reveals structure that is invisible if we consider each problem on its own. The aggregate we make of all these Diophantine problems is called a scheme.
We will return to schemes later, and will try, with out giving precise definitions, to convey some sense of what is meant by this not very suggestive term. of the immense progress that has taken place in arith-A word of apology: I will give only the barest sketch metic geometry in recent decades—there is simply too much to cover in an article of the present scope. I have chosen instead to discuss at some length the idea of a scheme, assuming, I hope, minimal technical know-ledge on the part of the reader.
In the final section, I shall discuss some outstanding problems in arith-metic geometry with the help of the ideas developed in the body of the article. It must be conceded that the theory of schemes, developed by Grothendieck and his collaborators in the 1960 s, belongs to algebraic geometry as a whole, and not to arithmetic geometry alone. I think, though, that in the arithmetic setting, the useof schemes, and the concomitant extension of geometric ideas to contexts that seem “nongeometric” at first glance, is particularly central.
2 Geometry with out Geometry Before we dive into the abstract theory of schemes, let us splash around a little longer among the polynomial equations of degree 2. Though it is not obvious from our discussion so far, the solution of Diophantine prob-lems is properly classified as part of geometry. Our goal here will be to explain why this is so. Suppose we consider the equation

$x2 + y2 = 1$. (5)

374

One can ask: which values ofx, y \in Qsatisfy (5)? This problem has a flavor very different from that of the pre-vious section. There we looked at an equation with no rational solutions. We shall see in a moment that (5), by contrast, has infinitely many rational solutions. The solutions resentative examples.
(The four solutions$x = 0$, y = 1 and x = 3 5$, y = −(±4 51\text{are rep}-$,0) and(0,±1) are the ones that would be said, in the usual mathematical parlance, to be “staring you in the face.”)Equation (5) is, of course, immediately recognizable as “the equation of a circle.” What, precisely, do wemean by that assertion? We mean that the set of pairs of real numbers plotted in the Cartesian plane.(x, y) satisfying (5) forms a circle when trance in the figure of the circle. Now suppose that wewant to find more solutions to (5).
One way to proceed So geometry, as usually construed, makes its enis as follows. Let P be the point line through P of slopem. Then we have the following(1,0), and let L be a geometric fact. (G) The intersection of a line with a circle consists of either zero, one, or two points; the case of a single point occurs only when the line is tangent to the circle. From (G) we conclude that, unless L is the tangent line to the circle at P, there is exactly one point other than P where the line intersects the circle. In order to find solutions for this point.
So suppose L is the line through(x$, y) to (5)$, we must determine coordinates(1,0) with slope equation ismy, which is to say it is the line L= m(x - 1). Then in order to find them who sex and the circle, we need to solve the simultaneous equa--coordinates of the points of intersection between Lm tions$y = m(x - 1) and x^{2} + y^{2} =$1; that is, we need to solvex2 + m2(x - 1)2 = 1 or, equivalently,(1 + m2)x2 - 2 m2 x + (m2 - 1) = 0. (6) Of course, (6) has the solution x = 1. How many other solutions are there?
The geometric argument above leads us to believe that there is at most one solution to (6). Alternatively, we can use the following algebraic fact, which is analogous2 to the geometric fact (G). (A) The equation$(1 + m^{2})x^{2} - 2m^{2}x + (m^{2} - 1) = 0$ has either zero, one, or two solutions inx. because the notion of tangency is more subtle in the algebraic setting, as we will see in section 4 below.2. Note that (A), unlike (G), contains no mention of tangency; that is

Of course, the conclusion of statement (A) holds for anyis a consequence of the factor theorem.nontrivial quadratic equation inx, not just (6); it theorem; one can find by direct computation that the solutions of (6) are In this case, it is not really necessary to appeal to any x = 1 and x = (m2 - 1)/(m2 +1 circle and L). We conclude that the intersection between the unit consists of (1, 0) and the point P withmm coordinates m(m2)2 -+ 11 , m - 22 m + 1 .
(7) which associates with each slope What is more, since every point on the circle, other than Equation (7) establishes a correspond en cem a solution Pmm \to to (5).Pm,(1, 0) itself, is joined to (1, 0)by a unique line, we find that we have established a one-to-one correspondence between slopesm and solutions, other than (1, 0), to$equation (5)$. A very nice feature of this construction is that it allows us to construct solutions to (5) not only over R but over smaller fields, like Q: it is evident that, when myielded by (7).
For example, taking is rational, so are the coordinates of the solutio nm = 2 yields the solution(5) admits infinitely many solutions over(3 5$,- {}^{45})$. In fact, not only does (7) show us that Q, it also gives us an explicit way toof a variablem. We leave it as an exercise to prove that parametrize the solutions in terms the solutions of (5) over Q, apart from(1,0), are in one- to-one correspondence with rational values ofrare is the Diophantine problem whose solutions canm. Alas, be parametrized in this way!
Still, polynomial equations like (5) with solutions that can be parametrized by one or more variables play a special role in arithmetic geometry; they are called any measure the best-understood class of examples inrational varieties and constitute by the subject. ture of this discussion. We relied on geometric intu-ition (e.g., our knowledge of facts like (G)) to give us I want to draw your attention to one essential fea ideas about how to construct solutions to (5).
On the other hand, now that we have erected an algebraic justification for our construction, we can kick away our geometric intuition as need less scaffolding. It was a geometric fact about lines and circles thatto us that (6) should have only one solution other than suggested x = 1. However, once one has had that thought, one can prove of the purely algebraic statement (A), which involves nothat there is at most one such solution by means geometry whatsoever.

IV.5. Arithmetic Geometry

erence to geometry means that it can be applied in sit-The fact that our argument can stand with out any refuations that might not, at first glance, seem geometric. For instance, suppose we wished to study solutions to (5) over the finite field not seem rightfully to be called “a circle” at all—it is F7. Now this solution set would just a finite set of points! Nonetheless, our geometri-cally inspired argument still works perfectly.
The possible values of corresponding solutions Pm in F7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and theare (-1, 0), (0, -1), (2,2),(with5,5)(,1(,50,)2, form the whole solution set of (5) over), (2, 5), (0,1). These seven points, to get herm F . We have now started to reap the benefits of consid - 7 ering a whole bundle of Diophantine problems at once; in order to find the solutions to (5) over F , we used a method that was inspired by the problem of find-ing solutions to (5) over R. Similarly, in general, meth - 7 ods suggested by geometry can help us solve Diophantine problems.
And these methods, once translated into purely algebraic form, still apply in situations that do not appear to be geometric. the purely algebraic appearance of certain equations is We must now open our minds to the possibility that deceptive. Perhaps there could be a sense of “geometry”that was general enough to include entities like the solution set of (5) over example had every right to be called a “circle.” And why F7, and in which this particular not? It has properties a circle has: most importantly forus, it has either zero, one, or two intersection points with any line.
Of course, there are features of “circleness” which this set of points lacks: infinitude, continu - ity, roundness, etc. But these latter qualities turn out to be inessential when we are doing arithmetic geometry. From our viewpoint the set of solutions of (5) over F has every right to be called the unit circle. view as an upending of the traditional story of Carte-To sum up, you might think of the modern point of sian space.
There, we have geometric objects (curves, lines, points, surfaces) and we ask questions such as, “What is the equation of this curve?” or “What are the coordinates of that point?” The underlying object is the geometric one, and the algebra is there to tell us about its properties. For us, the situation is exactly reversed: the underlying object is the equation, and the various geometric properties of solution sets of the equation are merely tools that tell us about the equation’s algebraic properties. For an arithmetic geometer, “the unit circle” is the equationx2 + y2 = 1.
And the round thing on the page? That is just a picture of the solutions to 375 the equation over R. It is a distinction that makes a remarkable difference. 3 From Varieties to Rings to Schemes In this section, we will attempt to give a clearer answer to the question, “What is a scheme?” Instead of trying to lay out a precise definition—which requires more alge-braic apparatus than would fit comfortably here—we will approach the question by means of an analogy. 3.1 Adjectives and Qualities So let us think about adjectives.
Any adjective, such as“yellow” for instance, picks out a set of nouns to which the adjective applies. For each adjective call this set of nounsΓ (A). For instance, Γ (A“yellow”, we might) is an infinite set that might look like banana, sun, . . . .3 And anyone would agree that\. lemon, school bus,Γ (A)\\} is an important thing to know about Now suppose that, moved by a desire for lexical par - A. simony, a theoretic i an among us suggested that adjec-tives could in fact be dispensed with entirely.
If, instead of grammatical theory involving only nouns. A, we spoke only of Γ (A), we could get by with a obvious ways that things could go wrong. For instance, what if lots of different adjectives were sent to the same Is this a good idea? Well, there are certainly some set of nouns? Then our new viewpoint would be less precise than the old one. But it certainly seems that iftwo adjectives apply to exactly the same set of nouns, then it is fair to say that the adjectives are the same, orat least synonymous.
instance, we can ask of two adjectives whether oneis What about relationships between adjectives? For stronger than another, in the way that “gigantic” is stronger than “large.” Is this relationship between adjectives still visible on the level of sets of nouns? The answer is yes: it seems fair to say that than”B precisely when Γ (A) is a subset of AΓ (B)is “stronger. In other words, what it means to say that “gigantic” is stronger than “large” is that all gigantic things are large, though some large things may not be gigantic. So far, so good. We have paid a price in technical difficulty:
it is much more cumbersome to speak of infinite sets of nouns than it was to use simple, familiar adjectives. But we have gained something, too: “yellow” is not so clear-cut, but since our goal is to make this look like mathematics, let us pretend that every object in the world is either3. Of course, in real life, there are nouns whose relationship with definitively yellow or definitively not yellow.

376

the opportunity for generalization. Our theoretic i an—whom we may now call a “set-theoretic grammarian”— observes that there is, perhaps, nothing special about the sets of nouns that happen to be of the formΓ (A) for some already known adjective A. Why not take a con- ceptual leap and“a set of nouns”? To avoid confusion with the usual redefine the word “adjective” to mean meaning of “adjective,” the theoretic i an might even use a new term, like “quality,” to refer to his new objects of study. with.
For example, there is a quality“sun”Now we have a whole new world of qualities to play which is stronger than “yellow,” and a quality“school bus”, “sun” (not the same thing as the noun“sun”!) which is stronger than the qualities “yellow,” “gigantic,” “large,”and“school bus”,“sun”. reconception of the notion of “adjective” is a good idea. In fact, it probably is not, which is why set-theo-I may not have convinced you that, on balance, this retic grammar is not a going concern. The correspond-ing story in algebraic geometry, however, is quite a different matter.

3.2 Coordinate Rings

A warning: the next couple of sections will be difficult going for those not familiar with rings and ideals—such readers can either skip to section 4, or try to follow the discussion after reading[III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) (see also algebraic numbers rings, ideals, and modules[IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)). on, just “variety”) is the set of solutions over Let us recall that a complex affine variety (from now C to some finite set of polynomial equations.

(This is not supposed to be obvious.) It is a question of general interest, given some variety X, to understand the ring of polynomial functions that take points on X to complex numbers. This ring is called the coordinate ring of X , and is denoted Γ (X). regard it as a function defined on our particular vari-ety Certainly, given any polynomial in V.

C[x, y]; it is the ring obtained from C[x, y] by declaring two polynomials f and g to be the same function whenever they take the same value at every point of$V$.

It turns out that equivalence relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) on the set of fence is a multiple ofand ghave this property precisely when their differ-x2 +y2 -1. Thus, the ring of poly- nomial functions on ideal generated byx2 V+is the quotient ofy2 - 1. This ring is denoted by C[x, y] by the$C$[x, y]/(x2 + y2 - 1). any variety.
It is not hard to show that, if We have shown how to attach a ring of functions to X and Y are two varieties, and if their coordinate ringsΓ (Y ) are isomorphic[I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), then X andΓ (X)Y are inand a sense the “same” variety. It is a short step from this observation to the idea of abandoning the study of vari-eties entirely in favor of the study of rings.
Of course, we are here in the position of the set-theoretic gram-marian in the parable above, with “variety” playing the part of “adjective” and “coordinate ring” the part of “setof nouns.” Happily, we can recover the geometric properties of a variety from the algebraic properties of its coordinate ring; if this were not the case, the coordinate ring would not be such a useful object! The relationship between geometry and algebra is a long story—and much of it belongs to algebraic geometry in general, not arithmetic geometry in particular—but to give the flavor, let us discuss some examples.
irreducibility A straightforward geometric property of a variety is. We say a variety X is reducible if X can be expressed as the union of two varieties neither of which is the whole of$X$. For example$, the X1 and X2$, variety

x2 = y2 (9)

in C2 is the union of the lines$x = y and x = −y$. A vari- ety is called irreducible if it is not reducible. All varieties are thus built up from irreducible varieties: the relation-ship between irreducible varieties and general varieties

A variety X is irreducible if and only if Γ (X) is an Experts will note that we are glossing over issues of “reducedness” here. ple is illustrative:
consider the two functions and We will not prove this fact, but the following exam-g = x + y on the variety Xdefined by (9)$. Nei-$ f = x - y ther of these functions is the zero function; note, for instance, that$f (1$, -1) is nonzero, as is g(1,1). Their product, however, is$x^{2} - y^{2}$, which is equal to zero onthe functions$X$; soΓ (X)f is not an integral domain. Notice that and g that we chose are closely related to the decomposition of X as the union of two smaller varieties. Another crucial geometric notion is that of functions from one variety to another.
(It is common practice tocall such functions “maps” or “morphisms”; we will use the three words interchangeably.) For instance, sup-pose that W is the variety in C3 determined by the equation xyz = 1. Then the map F$: C3$\to C2 defined by F(x$, y, z) = 12 (x + yz)$, 2 i1 (x - yz) maps points of W to points of V . eties makes it very easy to see the maps between the varieties.
We merely observe that if It turns out that knowing the coordinate rings of vari-$G$:$V \to V \text{is a}$ map between varieties$V^{1} and V^{2}$, and if f1 is a polyno-2 mial function ontion on V that sends every point V2, then we have a polynomial func-v to f (G(v)).

What is more, one has the following theorem. Fact.dence sending For any pair of varieties G to G* is a bijection between the poly-V , W , the correspon- nomial functions sending W to V and the C-algebra homomorphisms fromΓ (V ) to Γ (W ).

Let us therefore move on to schemes.

3.3 Schemes

We have seen that each varietyΓ (X), and further more that the algebraic study of these X gives rise to a ring rings can stand in for the geometric study of varieties. But just as not every set of nouns corresponds to an adjective, not every ring arises as the coordinate ringof a variety. For example, the ring Z of integers is not the coordinate ring of a variety, as we can see by the following argument: for every complex number a and every variety V , and therefore V , the constant function C ⊂ Γ (V ) for every variety a is a function on V .
Since Z does not contain C as a subring, it is not the coordinate ring of any variety. marian’s coup de grâce. We know that some, but not all, Now we are ready to imitate the set-theoretic gram rings arise from geometric objects (varieties); and weknow that the geometry of these varieties is described by algebraic properties of these special rings.

(In fact, we are hid-ing some technicalities; it is correct to say that So, after all this work, the definition of scheme is affine schemes schemes will not interfere with the phenomena that are rings.
Restricting our attention to affine we are aiming to explain.) More interesting is to askhow we can carry out the task whose difficulty “disconcerted” the early algebraic geometers—how can weidentify “geometric” features of arbitrary rings? For instance, if R is supposed to be an arbitrary geo- metric object, it ought to have “points.” But what arethe “points” of a ring? Clearly we cannot mean by this the elements of the ring; for in the case$R = Γ (X)$, the elements ofwe need, given a point R are functionsp onon X, is some entity attached X, not points on X.
What to the ring The key observation is that we can think of R that corresponds to p. p as a map fromΓ (X) to C: given a functionf from Γ (X) we map it to the complex numberf (p). This map is a homomorphism, called theatp. Since points on X give us homomorphisms on evaluation homomorphismΓ (X)ring R, a natural way to define the word “point” for the$= Γ (X)$, with out using geometry, is to say that a “point” is a homomorphism from R to C. It turns out that the kernel of such a homomorphism is a maximal ideal, i.e., a proper ideal in larger ideal except R itself.
More over, every maximal R which is contained in no ideal ofway to describe the points of R arises from a point p Xof might be to say that X. So a very concise they are the maximal ideals of R. A modern algebraic geometer would say that all points, not only the maximal ones. The “points” cor-prime ideals correspond to responding to the nonmaximal ideals are not points in the usual sense of the term;
for instance, the point corresponding to the zero ideal (when it is prime) is the “generic point,” which is in one sense every where on X at once, and in another sense no where in par- ticular at all.
This description sounds rather woolly, but on the algebraic side the zero ideal is something quite concrete—and in fact, having a precise notion of “generic point” turns out quite often to be useful in making a certain species of vague geometric argument into a rigorous proof. The definition we have arrived at makes sense for all rings R, and not just those of the form R = Γ (X). So we might define the “points” of a ring ideals. The set of prime ideals of R is given the name R to be its prime

To specify and f (y)f , I merely have toin Z. But I cannot choose these values arbitrarily: since in R, it must be the case that f (x)2+f (y)(x2)2+-y12=-0 in1 =Z0. In other words, the pair tion over Z to the Diophantine equation(f (x)$, f (y)) \text{constitutes a solu} - x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$. What is more, the same argument shows that, for ring S, a homomorphism f:$R \to S \text{yields a solutionany}$ over S to x2 + y2 = 1, and vice versa. In summary, for each twe en the set of ring homomorphisms from S, there is a one-to-one correspondence be-R to S, and solutions over$S to x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$.
This behavior is what we have in mind when we say that the ring$R$“packages” information about Diophantine equations over different rings. esting geometric property of varieties can be computedby means of the coordinate ring, which means it can It turns out, just as one might hope, that every inter be defined not only for varieties but also for general schemes.

Thus, we say in general that a scheme Spec X is irreducible if and only if Γ (X) is an integral R is irreducible if and only ifmore precisely, if the quotient of R is an integral domain (or, R by its nilradical is an integral domain). One can speak of the connectedness of a scheme, its dimension, whether it is smooth, andso forth. All these geometric properties turn out, like irreducibility, to have purely algebraic descriptions. Infact, to the arithmetic geometer’s way of thinking, all these are, at bottom, algebraic properties.

For any ringx2 + y R2, we will denote by= 1. V (R) the set In particular, it is ahow large this set is: in other words, how many points If Ris a finite field finite Fp , the setset.

The alternative isto declare that L is not tangent to V;
but then we are in the equally unsavory situation of having a line which, while not tangent to the circle2 V , intersects it at only one point. You are now beginning to see why Idid not include an algebraic definition of “tangent” in statement (A) above!This quandary illustrates the nature of arithmetic geometry nicely.
When we move into novel contexts, like geometry over F , some features stay fixed (such as “a line intersects a circle in at most two points”), while others have to be discarded (such as “there exists$p$ exactly one line, which we may call the tangent line tothe circle at(1,0), that intersects the circle at (1$, 0) and$ no other point”4). to compute the number of points inall, when Notwithstanding these subtleties, we are now readyp = 2 one can check directly that V (Fp )(.

Fermat’s last theorem (rightly called “Fermat’s conjecture,” since it is almost impossible to imagine that fermat [VI.12](/part - 06/pierre - fermat - 1601665) proved it) asserts that the

One might expect that an elliptic curve with many points It turns out that some elliptic curves have infinitely over Q would tend to have more points over finite fields as well, since the coordinates of a rational point can be reduced modpto yield a point over the finite field F . Conversely, one might imagine that, by knowing the listof numbers$a^{p}$, one could draw conclusions about thep points of E over Q. way to package the information of the infinite list ofintegers In order to draw such conclusions, one needs a nicea .
Such a package is given by the L-function [III.47](/part-03/l-functions) of the elliptic curve, defined to be the following function of a variablep s: L(E, s) = p (1 - app-s + (p1()-2)s)-1.

We do not have the space here to state the conjecture in full generality. However, the following conjecture would follow from Birch–Swinnerton - Dyer. 381 Conjecture.points over QThe elliptic curve if and only if L(E, E1)has infinitely many = 0. in 1988:

It follows from a theorem of Gross and Zagier that rational points if L(E, s) has a simple Ehas infinitely many zero ats = 1. That more or less sums up our present knowledge about the relationship between L-functions and rational points on elliptic curves.
This lack of knowledge has not, how - ever, prevented us from constructing a complex of ever more rarefied conjectures in the same vein, of which the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is only a tiny and relatively down - to-earth sliver. Before we leave the subject of counting points behind, we will pause and point out one more beautiful result: the theorem of andré weil [VI.93](/part - 06/andr - weil - 19061998) bounding the number of points on a curve over a finite field.
(Because we have not introduced projective geometry, we will satisfy ourselves with a some what less beautiful formulation than the usual one.) let polynomial in two variables, and let F(x, y)X be an irreducible be the scheme of solutions of define a certain subset of F(x, y) = 0. Then the complex points of C2, which we call an algebraic X curve condition on the points of. Since X is obtained by imposing one polynomial C2, we expect that X has complex dimension 1, which is to say it has real dimen - sion 2. Topologically speaking, X(C) is, therefore, a surface.
It turns out that, for almost all choices ofthe surface X(C)will have the topology of a “g - holed F , doughnut” with tive integersg andd points removed, for some nonneg a - d. In this case we say that X is a curve of genus In section 2 we saw that the behavior of schemes overg. finite fields seemed to “remember” facts arising from our geometric intuition over R and C: our example there was the fact that circles and lines intersect in at most two points. The theorem of Weil reveals a similar, though much deeper, phenomenon. Fact.is a curve of genus Suppose the scheme$g$.

The more compli-cated the topology of Weil’s theorem illustrates the startlingly close bonds X(C), the further the number of$382 F$ p-points can vary from the “expected” answer ofp. What is more, it turns out that knowing the size ofthe set X(F )for every finite field F allows us to determine the genus ofsets of poin tsq X(F )some how “remember” the topol-$X$.
In other words, theqfinite ogy of the space of complex points language, we say that there is a theory applying to gen - q X(C)!

In thisd = 2: our previous result thatp - 1 points therefore conforms exactly with the Weil X(Fp ) contains either p + 1 or bounds. We also remark that elliptic curves always have genus 1;
so the theorem of Hasse alluded to above is a special case of Weil’s theorem as well. Recall from section 2 that the solutions to x2 + y2 = 1, over R, over Q, or over various finite fields, could be parametrized by the variable parametrization that enabled us to determine a sim-m. It was this ple formula for the size of$X(F^{p}) \text{in this case}$. We remarked earlier that most schemes could not be so parametrized; now we can make that statement a bit more precise, at least for algebraic curves.

5.2 Rational Points on Curves

As we said above, some elliptic curves (which are curves of genus 1) have finitely many rational points, and others have infinitely many. What is the situation for algebraic curves of other flavors?We have already encountered a curve of genus 0 with infinitely many points: namely, the curve On the other hand, the curve x2 + y2 = x27 also has + y2 = 1.$genus 0$, and a simple modification of the argument ofthe first section shows that this curve has no rational points.

If X is a curve of genus greater than 2, in fact, he proved a more general theorem of which this conjecture is a special case. It is worth remark-This conjecture was proved by Faltings in 1983;

For example, if When you prove that a set is finite, it is natural to f (x)the curve is a degree 6 polynomial with no repeated roots, y2 = f (x)turns out to have genus 2; so by Faltings’s theorem there are only finitely many pairs ofrational numbers(x$, y) satisfying y^{2} = f (x)$.

No one has yet been successful at this task. If one could prove that the answer to the question above was affirmative, it would probably bol-ster our faith in the correctness of Lang’s conjecture,

though of course it would bring us no nearer to turning the conjecture into a theorem. In this article we have seen only a glimpse of the modern theory of arithmetic geometry, and perhaps Ihave over emphasized mathematicians’ successes at the expense of the much larger territory of questions, like Lang’s conjecture above, about which we remain wholly ignorant.

Introduction

Topology is concerned with the properties of a geomet-ric shape that are unchanged when we continuously deform it. In more technical terms, topology tries toclassify topological spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), where two spaces are considered the same if they are homeomorphic. Algebraic topology assigns numbers to a topological space, which can be thought of as the “number of holes”in that space. These holes can be used to show that two spaces are not homeomorphic: if they have differ-ent numbers of holes of some kind, then one cannot be a continuous deformation of the other.
In the happi-est cases, we can hope to show the converse statement: that two spaces with the same number of holes (in some precise sense) are homeomorphic. with its origins in the nineteenth century. Before that, mathematics usually sought to solve problems exactly: Topology is a relatively new branch of mathematics, to solve an equation, to find the path of a falling body, to compute the probability that a game of dice will lead to bankruptcy. As the complexity of mathematical problems grew, it became clear that most problems would never be solved by an exact formula:
a classic example is the problem, known as the three-body

383

problem of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon under the influence of[V.33](/part-05/the-three-body-problem), of computing the future movements gravity. Topology allows the possibility of making qual-it ative predictions when quantitative ones are impossible. For example, a simple topological fact is that a trip from New York to Montevideo must cross the equator at some point, although we cannot say exactly where. 1 Connectedness and Intersection Numbers Perhaps the simplest topological property is one called connectedness.
This can be defined in various ways, as we shall see in a moment, but once we have a notion of what it means for a space to be connected we can then divide a topological space up into connected pieces, called components. The number of these pieces is a simple but useful different numbers of connected components, then they invariant [I.4 §2.2](/part-01/general-goals): if two spaces have are not homeomorphic. of connectedness are equivalent. However, they can be generalized to give ways of measuring the number of For nice topological spaces, the different definitions holes in a space;
these generalizations are interestingly different and all of them are important. notion of a mapping The first interpretation of connectedness uses thef from the unit interval path, which is defined to be a continuous[0,1] to a given space X. (We think of f as a path from f (0) to f (1).) Let us declare two points ofpath from one to the other. The set of X to be equivalent if there is a equivalence classes of X and is written[I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) is called the set ofπ (X).
This is a very natural way ofpath components defining the “number of connected pieces” into which X breaks up. One can generalize this notion by con-0 side ring mappings into X from other standard spaces such as spheres: this leads to the notion of homotopy groups, which will be the topic of section 2. based on functions from functions from a line segment into A different way of thinking about connectedness is X to the real line rather than X. Let us assume that we are in a situation where it makes sense to differentiate functions onopen subset of some Euclidean space, or more gener-X.
For example, X could be an ally a valued functions on smooth manifold X whose derivative is every where[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Consider all the real equal to zero: these functions form a real[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), which we call H0(X, R)(the “zeroth cohom-vector space ology group of Xwith real coefficients”). Calculus tells us that if a function defined on an interval has deriva-tive zero, then it must be constant, but that is not true 384 when the domain has several connected pieces:
all wecan say then is that the function is constant on each connected piece of X. The number of degrees of free- dom of such a function is therefore equal to the num-ber of connected pieces, so the dimension of the vector space H0(X, R) is another way to describe the number of connected components of example of a cohomology group. Cohomology will be X. This is the simplest discussed in section 4.We can use the idea of connectedness to prove a serious theorem of algebra: every real polynomial of odd degree has a real root. For example, there must be some real numberx such that x3 + 3 x - 4 = 0.
The basic observation is that whenor a highly negative number, the termx is a large positive numberx3 is much bigger (in absolute value) than the other terms of the polyno - mial. Since this top term is an odd power ofx, we havef (x) > 0 for some positive number x and f (x) < 0 for some negative number then it would be a continuous mapping from the realx. If f were never equal to zero, line into the real line minus the origin. But the real lineis connected, while the real line minus the origin has two connected components, the positive and negative numbers.
It is easy to show that a continuous map froma connected space X to another space Y must map X into just one connected component ofthis contradicts the fact thatf takes both positive and Y: in our case, negative values. Thereforef must be equal to zero at some point, and the proof is complete. This argument can be phrased in terms of the “intermediate value theorem” of calculus, which is indeed one of the most basic topological theorems.
An equivalent reformulation of this theorem states that a continuous curve that goes from the lower half-plane tothe upper half-plane must cross the horizontal axis at some point. This idea leads toone of the most useful concepts in topology. let intersection numbers M, be a smooth oriented manifold. (Roughly speaking, a manifold is oriented if you cannot continuously slidea shape about inside it and end up with a reflection of that shape. The simplest nonoriented manifold is a Möbius strip:
to reflect a shape, slide it around the strip an odd number of times.) Let A and B be two closed oriented submanifolds ofup to the dimension of M. Finally, suppose that M with dimensions adding A and Bthe “correct” dimension, namely 0, and is therefore aintersect transversely, so that their intersection has collection of separated points. assigning a weight of Now letp be one of these points. There is a way of + 1 or - 1 to p, which depends IV. Branches of Mathematics B A A C (a) (b) Figure 1(a)A · Bi nt er section numbers:$=$1; (b)$A · C = −1$.

For example, M , B is a closed curve, and appropriate directions are given to B, then the weight of p will tell you whether B crosses A and Aonly finitely many points, then we can define the inter-upwards or downwards atp. If A and B intersect in section number of A and B, written A · B, to be the sum of the weights (+1 or - 1) at all the intersection points.

To see why this might be true, consider again the case where A and B are curves and M is two dimensional: if1, we can wiggle one of them to turn that point into A and B meet at a point with weight three points with weights 1,-1, and 1, but the total contribution to the intersection number is unchanged. This is illustrated in figure 2. As a result, the intersection number A · Bis defined for any two submanifolds of complementary dimension:
if they do not intersect transversely, one can move them until they do and use the definition we have just given. In particular, if two submanifolds have nonzero intersection number, then they can never be moved to IV.6. Algebraic Topology Figure 3 A surface bounded by a knot. be disjoint from each other. This is another way todescribe the earlier arguments about connectedness. It is easy to write down one curve from New York to Montevideo whose intersection number with the equator is equal to 1. Therefore, no matter how we move that curve (provided that we keep the endpoints fixed:
more generally, if either boundary should be kept fixed), its intersection num - A or B has a boundary, then that ber with the equator will always be 1, and in particular it must meet the equator in at least one point. One of many applications of intersection numbers in topology is the idea offrom knot theory [III.44](/part - 03/knot - polynomials). Alinking numbers knot is a path in space that, which comes begins and ends at the same point, or, more formally, a closed connected one-dimensional submanifold of R3. Given any knot$S in R3 with K$as its boundary (see figure 3).
Now let$K$, it is always possible to find a surface$L$ be a knot that is disjoint fromof K with Lis defined to be the intersection number K. The linking number of numbers imply that if the linking number of L with the surface S. The properties of intersection K with L is nonzero, then the knots sense that it is impossible to pull them apart. K and Lare “linked,” in the 2 Homotopy Groups If we remove the origin from the plane R2, then we obtain a new space that is different from the plane in a fundamental way: it has a hole in it.
However, we cannot detect this difference by counting components, since both the plane and the plane with out the origin are connected. We begin this section by defining an invariant called the fundamental group, which does detect this kind of hole. As a first approximation, one could say that the elements of the fundamental group of a space X are loops, which can be formally defined as continuous functionsf from [0,1] to X such that f (0) = f (1). However, this is not quite accurate, for two reasons.
The first reason, which is extremely important, is that two loops 385 XXBBAAXX Figure 4 group and in higher homotopy groups. Multiplication in the fundamental are regarded as equivalent if one can be continuously deformed to the other while all the time staying inside Xbe more formal about this, let us suppose that. If this is the case, we say that they are homotopicf . Toandfis a collection of loops1 are two loops. Then afshomotopyin X, one for each between sf0 between and0 f1 0 and 1, such that the function F(s$, t) = f (t) \text{is a con} - s$ tinuous function from[0,1]2 to X.
Thus, as s increases from 0 to 1, the loop f1. If two loops are homotopic, then we count them asfs moves continuously from f0 to the same. So the elements of the homotopy group arenot actually loops but equivalence classes, or homotopy classes Even this is not quite correct, because for technical, of loops. reasons we need to impose an extra condition on our loops: that they all start from (and therefore end at)a given point, called the base point. If X is connected, it turns out not to matter what this base point is, butwe need it to be the same for all loops.
The reason for this is that it gives us a way to multiply two loops: ifis the base point and A and B are two loops that startx and end at around A and then going aroun dx, then we can define a new loop by going B. This is illustrated in figure 4. We regard this new loop as the product ofthe loops A and B. It is not hard to check that the homo- topy class of this product depends only on the homo-topy classes of A and B, and that the resulting binary operation turns the set of homotopy classes of loops into a group [I.3 §2.1](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions).
It is this group that we call the fundamental group of$X$. It is denoted π1(X). the spaces we are likely to encounter. This makes it animportant way to distinguish one space from another. The fundamental group can be computed for most of First of all, for anyn the fundamental group of Rn is the trivial group with just one element, because any loop in Rn can be continuously shrunk to its base point. On the other hand, the fundamental group of R2\{0, the plane with the origin removed, is isomorphic to the group Z of the integers.
This tells us that we can associate with any loop in R2\ {0} an integer that does not change 386 if we modify the loop in a continuous way. This inte-ger is known as the winding number. Intuitively, the winding number measures the total number of times that the mapping goes around the origin, with coun-ter clockwise circuits counting positively and clockwise ones negatively. Since the fundamental group ofis not the trivial group$, R2$\ {0} cannot be homeomor - R2 \ {0}phic to the plane.
(It is an interesting exercise to try to find an elementary proof of this result—that is, a proof that does not use, or implicitly reconstruct, any of the machinery of algebraic topology. Such proofs do exist, but it is tricky to find them.) A classic application of the fundamental group is to prove[V.13](/part - 05/the - fundamental - theorem - of - algebra), which states that every nonconstant polyno-the fundamental theorem of algebra mial with complex coefficients has a complex root.
(The proof is sketched in the article just cited, though the fundamental group is not explicitly mentioned there.) of “one-dimensional holes” that a space has. A basic example is given by the circle, which has fundamental The fundamental group tells us about the number group Z, just as R2\ {0} does, and for essentially the same reason: given a path in the circle that begins and ends at the same point, we can see how many times itgoes around the circle.
In the next section we shall see some more examples. Before we think about higher-dimensional holes, we first need to discuss one of the most important topolog-ical spaces: then-dimensional sphere. For any natural number$n$, this is defined to be the set of points in R$n^{+1}$ at distance 1 from the origin. It is denoted0-sphere S0 consists of two points, the 1-sphere Sn. Thus$, the S1 is$ the circle, and the 2-sphere S2 is the usual sphere, like the surface of Earth.
Higher-dimensional spheres take a little bit of getting used to, but we can work with them in the same way that we can with lower-dimensional spheres. For example, we can construct the 2-sphere from a closed two-dimensional disk by identifying all the points on the boundary circle with each other. Inthe same way, the 3-sphere can be obtained from a solid three-dimensional ball by identifying all the points onthe boundary 2-sphere.
A related picture is to think of the 3-sphere as being obtained from our familiar three-dimensional space R3 by adding one point “at infinity.”Now let us think about the familiar sphere$S2$. This has trivial fundamental group, since any loop drawn on the sphere can be shrunk to a point. However, this does not mean that the topology of$S^{2} \text{is trivial}$. It just means that in order to detect its interesting properties

we need a different invariant. And it is possible to base such an invariant on the observation that even if loops can always be shrunk, there are other maps that cannot. Indeed, the sphere itself cannot be shrunk to a point. To say this more formally, the identity map from the sphere to itself is not homotopic to a map from the sphere to just one point. This idea leads to the notion of higher-dimensional homotopy groups of a topological space idea is to measure the number of “$n$-dimensional holes”X.

Once again, we consider two mappings from Sn toelements of the X to be equivalent if they are homotopic. And thenth homotopy group π (X) are again defined to be the homotopy classes of these mappings.nf ([0 Let,01)]=finto the circ lef (be a continuous map from1) = x. If we like we can turn the interval S1 by “identifying” the points 0[0,1] to X with and 1: then specified point inf becomes a map from S1 mapping to x.

The “product” mapping to Xis defined as follows. First “pinch” the equator A·B from of Sn down to a point.
When n = 1, the equator con- sists of just two points and the result is a figure eight. Similarly, for generaln, we end up with two copies of Sn that touch each other, one made out of the northern hemisphere and one out of the southern hemisphere ofthe original unpinched copy of$S^{n}$. We now use the map Athe top half intoto map the bottom half into X , with the equator mapping to the X and the map B to map base pointx.
(For both halves, the pinched equator is playing the part of the point As in the one-dimensional case, this operation makess.) the set homotopy group of the spaceπn(X) into a group, and this group is the X. One can think of itnth as measuring how many “$n$-dimensional holes” a space has. These groups are the beginning of “algebraic” topology: starting from any topological space, we constructan algebraic object, in this case a group.
If two spaces are homeomorphic, then their fundamental groups (and higher homotopy groups) must be isomorphic. This is richer than the original idea of just measuring

This shows that all the higher homotopy groups of Rm are also trivial, which is a precise formulation of the vague idea that Rm has no holes. different topological spaces Under certain circumstances one can show that two X and Y must have the same number of holes of all types.
This is clearly true if X and Y are homeomorphic, but it is also true if X and Yequ iv a len ce are equivalent in a weaker sense, known as. Let X and Y be topological spaces and lethomotopyf0 and f1 be continuous maps from X to Y . A homo- topy from spheres: it is a continuous family of continuous mapsf0 to f1 is defined more or less as it was for from X to Y that starts with f0 and ends with f1. As then, if such a homotopy exists, we say that are homotopic.

(Notice that if we obtain the definition of a homeomorphism.) When there is a homotopy equivalence from and Y are homotopy equivalent, and also that X to Y, we say that X and XY have the same homotopy type. is the plane with the origin removed.
We have already observed that these have the same fundamental group, A good example is when X is the unit circle and Y and commented that it was “for essentially the same reason.” Now we can be more precise. Let$f$:$X \to Y$ be the map that takes(x, y) belongs to the circle and the second to the plane).(x, y) to (x, y)(where the first Let$g$: Y \to  X be the map that takes (u$, v) to\sqrt{u}2u + v2$, . qrt{u}2 v + v2.

(Note thatu2+v2 is never zero because the origin is not contained in Y .) Then g ◦ f is easily seen to equal the identity on the unit circle, so it is certainly homotopic tothe identity. As forf ◦g, it is given by the same formula aseach radial line to the point where that line inter sec tsg itself. More geometrically, it takes the points on the unit circle. It is not hard to show that this map ishomotopic to the identity on Y . (The basic idea is to “shrink the radial lines down” to the points where they intersect the circle.)

homotopy equivalent to the circle. Figure 5 Some spaces that are equivalent if they have the same number of holes ofall types. This is a more flexible notion of “having the Very roughly speaking, two spaces are homotopy same shape” than the notion of homeomorphism. For example, Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic to each other, but they are all homo-topy equivalent. Indeed, they are all homotopy equivalent to a point: such spaces are called and one thinks of them as the spaces that have no contractible, hole of any sort.
The circle is not contractible, but it is homotopy equivalent to many other natural spaces: the plane R2 minus the origin (as we have seen), the cylinder S1 . imes  R, the compact cylinder S1 . imes  [0, 1], and even the Möbius strip (see figure 5). Most invariants in algebraic topology (such as homotopy groups and cohomology groups) are the same for any two spaces that are homotopy equivalent. Thus, knowing that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers tells us that the same is true for the various homotopy equivalent spaces just mentioned.
roughly speaking, this says that all these spaces have “one basic one-dimensional hole.” 3 Calculations of the Fundamental Group and Higher Homotopy Groups To give some more feeling for the fundamental group, let us review what we already know and look at a few more examples. The fundamental group of the2-sphere, or indeed of any higher-dimensional sphere, is trivial. The two-dimensional torus mental group Z2= Z. imes Z.
Thus, a loop in the torus deter-S1 . imes S1 has funda- mines two integers, which measure how many times it winds around in the meridian direction and how many in the longitudinal direction. The fundamental group can also be non-Abelian; that is, we can haveab ≠ ba for some elements a and b of the fundamental group. The simplest example is a spacegle point (see figure 6).
The fundamental group of X built out of two circles that meet at a sin - X is the free group [IV.10 §2](/part - 04/geometric - and - combinatorial - group - theory) on two generatorsa and 388 a b Figure 6 One-point union of two circles.

More gener-This space may seem some what artificial, but it is ally, the fundamental group of the plane with removed is the free group ond generators: this is a pre - d points cise sense in which the fundamental group measures the number of holes. In contrast with the fundamental group, the higher homotopy groups2. Figure 7 gives a “proof with out words” in the caseπn(X) are Abelian when n is at leastn = 2, the proof being the same for any larger n. In the figure, we view the 2-sphere as the square with its boundary identified to a point.
So any elements A and Bsquare toof π2(X)Xare represented by continuous maps of the that map the boundary of the square to the base pointa homotopy from$x$. The figure exhibits (several steps of)AB to BA, with the shaded regions and the boundary of the square all mapping to the base pointx. The picture is reminiscent of the sim- plest nontrivial braid, in which one string is twisted around another; this is the beginning of a deep con-nection between algebraic topology and braid groups [III.4](/part - 03/braid - groups). IV. Branches of Mathematics dimensions.
For example, every compact connected The fundamental group is especially powerful in low surface (or two-dimensional manifold) is homeomor-phic to one of those on a standard list (see differential topology manifolds on this list have different (nonisomorphic)[IV.7 §2.3](/part - 04/dierential - topology)), and we compute that all the fundamental groups. So, when you capture a closed sur-face in the wild, computing its fundamental group tells you exactly where it fits in the classification. More over, the geometric properties of the surface are closely tied to its fundamental group.
The surfaces with anian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) of positive curvature rie man-[III.13](/part - 03/curvature) (the 2-sphere and exactly the surfaces with finite fundamental group; the real projective plane [I.3 §6.7](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions)) are surfaces with a metric of curvature zero (the torus and Klein bottle) are exactly the surfaces with a fundamental group that is infinite but “almost Abelian” (there isan Abelian subgroup of finite index);
and the remaining surfaces, those that have a metric of negative curvature, have “highly non - Abelian” fundamental group, like the free group (see figure 8). sional manifolds, we now know, thanks to the advances After more than a century of studying three-dimenof Thurston and Perelman, that the picture is almost the same for these as it is for 2 - manifolds: the fundamental group controls the geometric properties ofthe 3-manifold almost completely (see differential topology4-manifolds and in higher dimensions: there are many[IV.7 §2.4](/part - 04/dierential - topology)).
But this is completely untrue for different folds with trivial fundamental group, and we need more simply connected manifolds, meaning man i invariants to be able to distinguish between them. (To begin with, the 4-sphere S4 and the product S2 . imes S2 are both simply connected. More generally, we can take the connected sum of any number of copies of$S^{2} \times S^{2}$, obtained by removing 4-balls from these manifolds and identifying the boundary 3-spheres.
These 4-manifolds are all simply connected, and yet no two of them are homeomorphic or even homotopy equivalent.) An obvious way in which we might try to distinguish different spaces is to use indeed this works in simple cases. For example, higher homotopy groups, andπ of the connected sum ofphic to Z2 r .
Also, we can show that the spherer copies of S2 . imes  S2 is isomor-(Sn)2 of any dimension is not contractible (although it is simply connected forn ⩾ 2) by computing that π (Sn) is iso- morphic to the integers (rather than the trivial group).Thus, each continuous map from the n - sphere to its elfn determines an integer, called the degree of the map,

A first In general, however, the homotopy groups are not a hint of this was Hopf’s 1931 discovery that$π^{3}(S^{2}) is$ isomorphic to the integers: it is clear that the 2-sphere has a two-dimensional hole, as measured by$π (S^{2})$ Z, but in what sense does it have a three-dimensional2 hole?
This does not correspond to our naive view of what such a hole should be. The problem of com-puting the homotopy groups of spheres turns out to be one of the hardest in all of mathematics: some ofwhat we know is shown in table 1, but despite massive efforts the homotopy groups$π (S^{2})$, for example, arei

known only fori ⩽ 64. There are tantalizing patterns in these calculations, with a number-theoretic flavor, butit seems impossible to formulate a precise guess for the homotopy groups of spheres in general. And com-puting the homotopy groups for spaces more complex than spheres is even more complicated. the so-called to represent a nonzero element of To get an idea of the difficulties involved, let us define Hopf map from S3 to S2π, which turns out(S2). There are in fact several equivalent definitions.
One of them is to regard a point(x , x , x , x ) in S3 as a pair of complex3 numbers do by setting(z1, zz2)=1 such thatx2 + 3 ix4 and|z1|2 z + |=zx2|2+=ix1. This we.

In the that each unit quaternion can be associated with a rota-tion of the sphere. If we fix some points in the sphere and map each unit quaternion to the image ofthe associated rotation, then we get a map from s under S3 to S2 that is homotopic to the map defined in the previous paragraph.

The Hopf map is an important construction, and will 4 Homology Groups and the Cohomology Ring Homotopy groups, then, can be rather mysterious and very hard to calculate. Fortunately, there is a different way to measure the number of holes in a topological space: homology and cohomology groups. The definitions are more subtle than the definition of homotopy groups, but the groups turn out to be easier to compute and are for this reason much more commonly used.
Recall that elements of thenth homotopy groupπcontinuous maps from then(X) of a topological spacen-sphere to X are represented by X . Let X be a manifold, for simplicity. There are two key differences between homotopy groups and homology groups. The first is that the basic objects of homology are more general thann-dimensional spheres: every closed orientedan element of then-dimensional submanifold nth homology group of A of X determines X, Hn(X).
This might make homology groups seem much big-ger than homotopy groups, but that is not the case, because of the second major difference between homo-topy and homology. As with homotopy, the elements of the homology groups are not the submanifolds themselves but equivalence classes of submanifolds, butthe definition of the equivalence relation for homology makes it much easier for two of these submanifolds to be equivalent than it is for two spheres to behomotopic.
here are some examples that convey some of its flavor. We shall not give a formal definition of homology, but Leta circle that goes around the origin. If we continuously X be the plane with the origin removed and let A be deform this circle, we will obtain a new curve that is homotopic to the original circle, but with homology wecan do more. For instance, we can start with a continuous deformation that causes two of its points to touch and turns it into a figure eight.
One half of this figure eight will have to contain the origin, but we can leave 390 Table 1 The first few homotopy groups of spheres. S1 S2 S3 S4π Z 0 0 0π 0 Z 0 0π 0 Z Z 0π 0 Z/2 Z/2 Zπ 0 Z/2 Z/2 Z/2π 0 Z/4 . imes Z/3 Z/4 . imes Z/3 Z/2π 0 Z/2 Z/2 Z . imes Z/4 . imes Z/3π 0 Z/2 Z/2 Z/2 . imes Z/2π 0 Z/3 Z/3 Z/2 . imes Z/2π10 0 Z/3 . imes Z/5 Z/3 . imes Z/5 Z/8 . imes Z/3 . imes Z/ A Figure 9 in the homology of the surface. The circle A represents zero that still and slide the other part away. The result is then two closed curves, with the origin inside one and out side the other.
This pair of curves, which together form a 1-manifold with two components, is equivalent to the original circle. It can be seen as a continuous deformation of a more general kind. A second example shows how natural it is to include other manifolds in the definition of homology. This time let X be R3 with a circle removed, and let A be a sphere that contains the circle in its interior. Suppose that the circle is in the XY-plane and that both it and the sphere A are centered at the origin. Then we can pinch the top and bottom ofthey just touch.
If we do so, then we obtain a shape A toward the origin until that looks like a torus, except that the hole in the mid-dle has been shrunk to zero. But we can open up this hole with the help of a further continuous deformation and obtain a genuine torus, which is a “tube” around the original circle. From the point of view of homology, this torus is equivalent to the sphere A.

(More generally, the definition of homology allows us to add up any collection of sub-manifolds, whether or not they overlap.) Here are some simple examples of homology groups, which, unlike the fundamental group, are always Abelian. The homology groups of a sphere,$H (S^{n})$, are isomorphic to thei

integers Z fori = 0 and for i = n, and 0 otherwise. This contrasts with the complicated homotopy groups of the sphere, and better reflects the naive idea that then-sphere has one n-dimensional hole and no other holes. Note that the fundamental group of the circle, the group of integers, is the same as its first homology group. More generally, for any path-connected space, the first homology group is always the “Abelianization”of the fundamental group (which is formally defined to be its largest Abelian quotient).
For example, the funda-mental group of the plane with two points removed is the free group on two generators, while the first homol-ogy group is the free Abelian group on two generators, or Z2. H The homology groups of the two-dimensional torus(S1. imes S1) are isomorphic to Z for i = 0, to Z2 for i = 1, i

and to Z fori = 2. All of this has geometric meaning. The zeroth homology group of any space is isomorphic to Zr for a space X with r connected components. So the fact that the zeroth homology group of the torus is isomorphic to Z means that the torus is connected. Any closed loop in the torus determines an element of the first homology group Z2, which measures how many times the loop winds around the meridian and longitu-dinal directions of the torus. And finally, the homology of the torus in dimension 2 is isomorphic to Z because the torus is a closed orientable manifold.
That tells usthat the whole torus defines an element of the second homology group of the torus, which is in fact a gen-erator of that group. By contrast, the homotopy group

As we have mentioned, calculating homology groups is much easier than calculating homotopy groups. Themain reason for this is the existence of results that tell you the homology groups of a space that is built up from smaller pieces in terms of the homology groups of those pieces and their intersections.
Another important property of homology groups is that they are “functo-rial” in the sense that a continuous mapf from a space X to a space Y leads in a natural way to a homomor- phism defined to bef* from[f (A)]Hi(X). In other words$, to H^{i}(Y ) \text{for eachf}^{*}i([A]):$ f*([A])is theis equivalence class of the image of We can define the closely related idea of “cohom-A under f . ology” simply by a different numbering.

Wei write For more general spaces than manifolds, cohomology[S] for the corresponding cohomology class. is not just a simple renumbering of homology. Informally, if element of X is a topological space, then we think of an Hi(X) as being represented by a codimen- sion-X.

The product in the cohomology ring is described by saying that[CP1][CP1] = [point], because any two distinct lines CP1 in the plane meet transversely in a single point.

First of all, it implies Bézout’stheorem on intersections of complex algebraic curves (seeof degree algebraic geometry d in CP2 represents[IV.4 §6](/part - 04/algebra)). An algebraic curved times the class of a line CP1 in$H2(CP2)$. Therefore, if two algebraic curves D and cohomology class E of degrees d[Dand∩ E]e equals meet transversely, then the[D] · [E] = (d[CP1])(e[CP1]) = de[point].
For complex submanifolds of a complex manifold, intersection numbers are always+1, not - 1, and so this means that We can also use the computation of the cohomology D and E meet in exactly de points. ring of groups of spheres. It turns out that CP2 to prove something about the homotopy CP2 can be constructed as the union of the 2-sphere and the closed four-dimensional ball, with each point of the boundary S^3 of the ball identified with a point in S^2 by the Hopf map, which was defined in the previous section.
A constant map from one space to another, or a map homotopic to a constant map, gives
rise to the zero homomorphism between the homology groups$H^{i}$, at least when$i > 0$. The Hopf map f:$S^{3} \to S^{2} also$ induces the zero homomorphism because the nonzero homology groups of S3 and S2 are in different dimensions. Nonetheless, we will show that topic to the constant map. If it were, then the spacef is not homo- CP2 obtained by attaching a 4-ball to the 2-sphere using the map obtained by attaching a 4-ball to the 2-sphere using af would be homotopy equivalent to the space constant map.

The striking feature of this picture is that any two of this huge family of circles have linking number 1 with each other: there is no way to pull any two of them apart (see figure 11). 5 Vector Bundles and Characteristic Classes We now introduce another major topological idea: fiber bundles. If E and B are topological spaces, x is a point in B, and p:

But there are many nontrivial fiber bundles. For example, the Möbiusstrip is a fiber bundle over the circle with fiber a closed interval.
This example helps to explain the old name“twisted product” for fiber bundles. Another example: the Hopf map makes the 3-sphere the total space of a circle bundle over the 2-sphere. plicated spaces from simple pieces.

A line bundle means a vector bundle of rank 1; for rank of the vector bun example, we can view the Möbius strip (not including its boundary) as a line bundle over the circle S1. It is a nontrivial trivial line bundle line bundle; that is, it is not isomorphic to the S1 . imes  R.

In order to classify smooth manifolds, it is important to study their tangent bundles, and in particular to see whether they are trivial or not. Some manifolds, like the circle S1 and the torus S1 . imes S1, do have trivial tangent bundle. The tangent bundle of ann-manifold Mare linearly independent at every point ofis trivial if and only if we can findnvector fields that M . So we can prove that the tangent bundle is trivial just by writing down such vector fields; see figure 12 for the circle orthe torus. But how can we show that the tangent bundle of a given manifold is nontrivial?

Figure 13 The hairy ball theorem.

One way is to use intersection numbers. Let M be a closed oriented image of the “zero-section” inside the tangent bund len-manifold. We can identify M with the T Mzero vector at that point. Since the dimension of, the section that assigns to every point of MT Mtheis precisely double that oftion numbers in section 1 gives a well-defined integer M, the discussion of inter sec-M2 = M · M, the self-intersection number of M inside T M; this is called the Euler characteristicχ(M).
By the definition of intersection numbers, for any vector field v Euler characteristic ofon M that meets the zero-section transversely, the M is equal to the number of zeros$of$ v, counted with signs. As a result, if the Euler characteristic of M is not zero, then every vector field on section; in other words, every vector field on M must meet the zero-M must equal zero some where. The simplest example occurs when$M \text{is the} 2 - sphere S^{2}$.
We can easily write down a vector field (for example, the one pointing toward the east along circles of latitude, which vanishes at the north and south poles) whose intersection number with the zero-section is 2. Therefore the 2-sphere has Euler characteristic 2, and so every vector field on the 2-sphere must vanish some where. This is a famous the-orem of topology known as the “hairy ball theorem”: it is impossible to comb the hair on a coconut (see figure 13). classes This is the beginning of the theory of, which measure how nontrivial a given vector characteristic bundle is.
There is no need to restrict ourselves to the tangent bundle of a manifold. For any oriented vector bundle define a cohomology class E of rank n on a topological spaceχ(E) in Hn(X), the X, we can Euler class the Euler class of, which vanishes if the bundle is trivial. Intuitively, E is the cohomology class represented by the zero set of a general section of E, which (for example, ifn submanifold of X is a manifold) should be a codimension-X, since X has codimension n in E.
If class of the tangent bundle in X is a closed oriented n-manifold, then the Euler Hn(X) = Z is the Euler characteristic of X.

tic classes was the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, generalized One of the inspirations for the theory of character is to all dimensions in the 1940 s. The theorem expresses the Euler characteristic of a closed manifold with a Riemannian metric as the integral over the manifold of a certain curvature function. More broadly, a central goal of differential geometry is to understand how the geo-metric properties of a Riemannian manifold such as its curvature are related to the topology of the manifold. (that is, bundles where the fibers are complex vector spaces) turn out to be particularly convenient:
indeed, The characteristic classes for complex vector bundles real vector bundles are often studied by constructing the associated complex vector bundle. If E is a com- plex vector bundle of rankn over a topological space X, theof cohomology classes on Chern classes of E are a sequence X, with ci(E)c1(E), . . . , cbe long ing ton(E)(H2)i(X), which all vanish if the bundle is trivial. The top Chern class,$c^{n}(E)$, is simply the Euler class of E: thus, it is the first obstruction to finding a section of E that is every where nonzero.
The more general Chern classes have a similar interpretation. For any 1⩽ j ⩽ n, ch oosej general sections of E. The subset of X over which these sections become linearly dependent will have codimension 2$(n + 1 - j) (assuming$, for example, that X is a manifold). The Chern class (cn()+1)-j(E) is pre- cisely the cohomology class of this subset. Thus the Chern classes measure in a natural way the failure of a given complex vector bundle to be trivial.
Thegin classes of a real vector bundle are defined to be the Pon try a Chern classes of the associated complex vector bundle. A triumph of differential topology is Sullivan’s 1977 theorem that there are only finitely many smooth closed simply connected manifolds of dimension at least 5 with any given homotopy type and given Pontryagin classes of the tangent bundle. This statement fails badly in dimension 4, as Donaldson discovered in the 1980 s (see differential topology [IV.7 §2.5](/part - 04/dierential - topology)).
6 Kco homology Theories-Theory and Generalized The effectiveness of vector bundles in geometry led toa new way of measuring the “holes” in a topological space$X$: looking at how many different vector bundles overa cohomology-like ring associated to any space, known Xthere are. This idea gives a simple way to define as$K$-theory (after the German word “Klasse,” since the theory involves equivalence classes of vector bundles).It turns out that K-theory gives a very useful new angle IV. Branches of Mathematics by which to look at topological spaces.
Some problems that could be solved only with enormous effort using ordinary cohomology became easy with idea was created in algebraic geometry by Grothendieck K - theory.

In this respect, X by forming the K-theory behaves like tensor ordinary cohomology.
The analogy suggests that the group K0(X) should form part of a whole sequence of Abelian groups groups can be defined.

So there are really only two different Bott peri-K-groups attached to any topological space:$K^{0}(X) and K^{1}(X)$.
This may suggest that K-theory contains less infor- mation than ordinary cohomology, but that is not so. Neither K-theory nor ordinary cohomology determines the other, although there are strong relations between them. Each brings different aspects of the shape of a space to the fore. Ordinary cohomology, with its num-bering, shows fairly directly the way a space is built up from pieces of different dimensions.ing only two different groups, looks cruder at first (and K-theory, hav- is often easier to compute as a result).
But geometric problems involving vector bundles often involve information that is subtle and hard to extract from ordinary cohomology, where as this information is brought to the surface by K-theory. cohomology is that the group The basic relation between KK0-theory and ordinary(X) constructed from the vector bundles onthe even-dimensional cohomology groups of X“knows” something about all X. To be precise, the rank of the Abelian group K0(X) is the sum

This connection comes from associat- ing with a given vector bundle on The odd K-group K1(X) is related in the same way to X its Chern classes. the odd-dimensional ordinary cohomology. As we have already hinted, the precise group$K^{0}(X)$, as opposed to just its rank, is better adapted to some geometric problems than ordinary cohomology. This phenomenon shows the power of looking at geomet-ric problems in terms of vector bundles, and thus ultimately in terms of linear algebra.
Among the classic applications of K-theory is the proof, by Bott, Ker- vaire, and Milnor, that the 0-sphere, the 1-sphere, the 3-sphere, and the 7-sphere are the only spheres whose tangent bundles are trivial. This has a deep algebraic consequence, in the spirit of the fundamental theorem of algebra: the only dimensions in which there can be a real division algebra (not assumed to be commutative or even associative) are 1, 2, 4, and 8. There are indeed division algebras of all four types:
the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions(see quaternions, octonions, and normed division algebras [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena)). bra of dimension trivial tangent bundle. In fact, let us merely assume that Let us see why the existence of a real division alge-n implies that the (n - 1)-sphere has we have a finite-dimensional real vector space bilinear map V . imes V \to V, which we call the “product,”V with a such that ifx and y are vectors in V with xy = 0, then eitherx = 0 or y = 0.
For convenience, let us also assume that there is an identity element 1 inso 1$· x = x · 1 = x \text{for all} x \in V$; one can, how - V , ever, do with out this assumption. Ifn, then we can identify V with Rn. Then, for each point V has dimensionx in the sphere (Sn)-1, left multiplication by x gives a linear isomorphism from Rn to itself. By scaling the output to have length 1, left multiplication bya diffeomorphism from Sn-1 to itself which maps thex gives point 1 (scaled to have length 1) totive of this diffeomorphism at the point 1 gives a lin - x.
Taking the deriva- ear isomorphism from the tangent space of the sphere at the point 1 to the tangent space atx. Since the pointx on the sphere is arbitrary, a choice of basis for the tangent space of the sphere at the point 1 deter-mines a trivialization of the whole tangent bundle of the$(n - 1)-sphere$. best “explanation” for the low-dimensional homotopy Among other applications, K-theory provides the groups of spheres, and in particular for the number-theoretic patterns that are seen there.
Notably, denom - 395 inators of Bernoulli numbers appear among those groups (such asπ (Sn) Z/24 for n at least 5), and this pattern was explained using Kervaire, and Adams.$n^{+3} K - \text{theory by Milnor}$, a deep analysis of linear differential equations on closed manifolds using the atiyah–singer index theorem K-theory.
The theorem has[V.2](/part-05/the-atiyahsinger-index-theorem) provides made theories in physics. K-theory important for gauge theories and string K-theory can also be defined for noncommutative rings, and is in fact the central con-cept in “noncommutative geometry” (see operator algebras The success of[IV.15 §5](/part-04/operator-algebras)).K-theory led to a search for other “generalized cohomology theories.” There is one other theory that stands out for its power: complex cobordism cobordism groups of a manifold. The definition is very geometric:
the complex M are generated by mappings of manifolds (with a complex structure onthe tangent bundle) into M . The relations say that any manifold counts as zero if it is the boundary of some other manifold. For example, the union of two circles would count as zero if you could find a cylinder whose ends were those circles. than either far into the structure of a topological space, but at It turns out that complex cobordism is much richer K-theory or ordinary cohomology. It sees the cost of being difficult to compute.
Over the past thirty years, a whole series of cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology and Morava have been constructed as “simplifications” of complex K-theories, cobordism: there is a constant tension in topology between invariants that carry a lot of information and invariants that are easy to compute. In one direction, complex cobordism and its variants provide the most powerful tool for the computation and understand-ing of the homotopy groups of spheres.
Beyond the range where Bernoulli numbers appear, we see deeper number theory such as modular forms [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms). In another direction, the geometric definition of complex cobordism makes it useful in algebraic geometry. 7 Conclusion The line of thought introduced by pioneering topolo-gists like riemann [VI.49] is simple but powerful. Try to translate any problem, even a purely algebraic one, into geometric terms. Then ignore the details of the geometry and study the underlying shape or topologyof the problem.
Finally, go back to the original problem and see how much has been gained. The funda-mental topological ideas such as cohomology are used

Taubes 1 Smooth Manifolds This article is about classifying certain objects called smooth manifolds, so I need to start by telling you what they are. A good example to keep in mind is the surface of a smooth ball. If you look at a small portion ofit from very close up, then it looks like a portion of a flat plane, but of course it differs in a radical way froma flat plane on larger distance scales. This is a general phenomenon:
a smooth manifold can be very convoluted, but must be quite regular in close-up. This “local regularity” is the condition that each point in a manifold belongs to a neighborhood that looks like a portion of standard Euclidean space in some dimension. If the dimension in question isfold, then the manifold itself is said to have dimensiond for every point of the mani-d. A schematic of this is shown in figure 1.What does it mean to say that a neighborhood “looks like a portion of standard Euclidean space”?
It means that there is a “nice” one-to-one mapφ from the neigh- borhood into Rd (with its usual notion of distance). One can think ofborhood with points inφas “identifying” points in the neigh-R$d$: that is, xis identified with coordinate chartφ(x). If we do this, then the functionof the neighborhood, and any chosenφ is called a basis for the linear functions on the Euclidean space is called a coordinate system. The reason for this is that φ allows us to use the coordinates in Rd to label points in the neighborhood: ifx belongs to the neighborhood,

Figure 1 resemble regions in a Euclidean space. Small portions of a manifold Figure 2 grid to a distorted rectangular grid. A transition function from a rectangular then one can label it with the coordinates ofφ(x). For example, Europe is part of the surface of a sphere. Atypical map of Europe identifies each point in Europe with a point in flat, two-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, a square grid labeled with latitude and longitude. These two numbers give us a coordinate sys-tem for the map, which can also be transferred to a coordinate system for Europe itself.
Now, here is a straightforward but central observation. Suppose that intersect, and suppose that functions M and N are two neighborhoods thatφ:$M \to R^{d} andψ$: N \to  Rd are used to give them each a coordinate chart. Then the intersection M ∩N is given two coordi- nate charts, and this gives us an identification between the open regions$φ(M ∩ N) and ψ(M ∩ N) of R^{d}$: given a point in the second isxin the first region, the corresponding point$ψ(φ^{-1}(x))$.
This composition of maps is called a coordinates from one of the charts on the intersecting transition function, and it tells you how the region relate to those of the other. The transition func-tion is a homeomorphism [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) between the regions

An illustration is given in figure 2. rounded by regions that can be identified with parts of Euclidean space is a The proper term for a space whose points are sur-topological manifold.
The word “topological” is used in order to indicate that there are no constraints on the coordinate-chart transition functions apart from the basic one that they should be continuous. However, some continuous functions are quite unpleasant, so one typically introduces extra constraints in order to limit the distorting effect that the transition functions can have on a rectangular coordinate grid. Of prime interest here is the case where the transition functions are required to be differentiable to all orders.
If a manifold has a collection of charts for which all the transition functions are infinitely differentiable, then it is said to have aa smooth manifold. Smooth manifolds are especially smooth structure, and it is called interesting because they are the natural arena for calculus. Roughly speaking, they are the most general con-text in which the notion of differentiation to any order makes intrinsic sense. A function f, defined on a manifold, is said to be differentiable Rd , the functionif, given any of its coordinate chartsg(y) = f (φ-1(y))(which is definedφ:

Calculus with differentiable transition functions, because a func-tion that might appear differentiable in one chart will not, in general, be differentiable when viewed from a neighboring chart. point. Consider the following two coordinate charts ofa neighborhood of the origin in the real line. The first is Here is a one-dimensional example to illustrate this the obvious chart that simply represents a real numberx by itself.

(Here the = x.) cube root of a negative number the cube root of-x.) What is the transition function xis defined to be minus between these two charts? Well, if region of R used for the first chart, thent is a point in theφ-1(t) = t, soψ(φ-1(t)) = ψ(t) = (t1()/){3}. This is a continuous function oftbut it is not differentiable at the origin.
on the region used for the second chart, the function Now consider the simplest possible function defined 397 h(s) = s, and let us work out the corresponding func- tionbe the value off on the manifold itself. The value ofh at the point s corresponding tof at x shouldx. This point isψ(x) = x1/3, so f (x) = h(x1/3) = x1/3. Finally, since the point to the pointt = φ(x) =xxin the manifold correspondsin the first region, the corresponding function on the first region is$g(t) = (t1()/){3}$.
(This is the same function asf only because φ happens to be the very special map that takes each number to itself.) Thus, the eminently differentiable functionh on one coordinate chart translates into the continuous butnot differentiable functiong on the other. Suppose one is given a topological manifold M with two sets of charts, both of which have infinitely differ-entiable transition functions. Then each set of charts gives us a smooth structure on the manifold. Of great importance is the fact that these two smooth structures can be fundamentally different.
Ktiable To see what this means, let us call the sets of chartsandif it is differentiable from the viewpoint of L. Given a function f , let us call it K-differ en-K, and point of L-differentiable L. It may easily happen that a function isif it is differentiable from the view Kversa. However, we can say that-differentiable with out being$L$-differentiable or vice K and L give the same smooth structure from M to itself with the following three properties.on M when there is a map, F , First, F is invertible and both F and F-1 are contin- uous.

The discussion that fol- lows will be almost entirely about compact manifolds. As some of the examples below will demonstrate, the story for compact manifolds is less convoluted than the analogous story for noncompact ones.

2.2 Dimension 1

There is only one compact, connected, one-dimensional topological manifold, namely the circle. More over, the circle has just one smooth structure. Here is one way torepresent this structure. Take as a representative circle the unit circle in theall points(x, y) with x2 xy+ y-plane, that is, the set of2 = 1. This can be cov- ered by two overlapping intervals, each of which cov-ers slightly more than half of the circle. The intervals Ututes a coordinate chart. The one on the left,1 and U2 are drawn in figure 3.
Each interval consti-U , can be parametrized in a continuous fashion by taking the1 angle of a given point as measured counterclockwis efrom the posit i vex-axis. For example, the point (1, 0) has angle 0, and the point(-1,0) has angle π. In order to parametrize angleπ at the negative U2 by angle, you will have to start withx-axis. If you move around U , varying this angle continuously, then when you reach the point(1,0) you will have parametrized it as a point2 in As you can see, the arcs U2 using the angle 2π. U1 and U2 intersect in two separated, smaller arcs; these are labeled figure 4.

For that matter, any manifold of dimension greater than 1 has smooth loops. Earlier, it was asserted that there is just one smooth, compact, connected, one-dimensional manifold, so all of these loops must be considered the“same.” Why is this? it might appear were it sitting in some larger space. Here is the answer.
We often think of a manifold as For example, we might imagine a circle sitting in the plane, or sitting knotted in three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, the notion of “smooth manifold”introduced above is an intrinsic one, in the sense that it does not depend on how the manifold is placed inside a higher-dimensional space. Indeed, it is not even necessary for there to be a higher-dimensional space at all. In the case of the circle, this can be said in the following way. The circle can be placed as a loop in the plane, or as a knot in 3-space, or whatever.
Each view of the circle in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space defines a collec-tion of functions that are considered differentiable: one just takes the differentiable functions of the coordinates of the big Euclidean space and restricts them to the circle. As it turns out, any one such collection defines the same smooth structure on the circle as any other. Thus, the smooth structures that are provided by these different views of a circle are all the same, even though

Since this article is not meant to pro-vide proofs, these questions are left as serious exercises with the following advice.
Think hard about the definitions and, for the smooth-manifold question, use some calculus.

2.3 Dimension 2

The story for two-dimensional, connected, compact manifolds is much richer than that for dimension 1. In the first place, there is a basic dichotomy between two kinds of manifold: orientable and nonorientable. Roughly speaking, this is the distinction between manifolds that have two sides and those that have just one. To give a more formal definition, a two-dimen-sional manifold is called orientable if every loop in the manifold that does not cross itself or have any kinks has two distinct sides.
This is to say that there is no path from one side of the loop to the other that avoids the loop yet remains very close to it. The Möbius strip (see figure 6) is not orientable because there are paths from one side of the central loop to the other that do not cross the central loop yet remain very close to it. The orientable, compact, connected, topological, two-dimensional manifolds are in one-to-one corre-spondence with a collection of fundamental foods: the apple, the doughnut, the two-holed pretzel, the three-holed pretzel, the four-holed pretzel, and so on (see figure 7).
Technically, they are classified by an integer, called the genus. This is 0 for the sphere, 1 for the torus, 2 for the two-holed torus, etc. The genus counts the number of holes that appear in a given example from

Figure 7 The orientable manifolds of dimension 2. Figure 8 Cutting and gluing. figure 7. To say that this classifies them is to say that two such manifolds are the same if and only if they have the same genus. This is a theorem due to poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912).As it turns out, every topological two-dimensional manifold has exactly one smooth structure, so the listin figure 7 is the same as the list of the smooth orientable two-dimensional manifolds.
Here one should keep in mind that the notion of a smooth manifold is intrinsic, and therefore independent of how the man-ifold is represented as a surface in 3-space, or in any other space. For example, the surfaces of an orange, a banana, and a watermelon each represent embed-ded images of the two-dimensional sphere, the left most example in figure 7. plays a key role when it comes to classifying manifoldsof higher dimensions.
Notice that the two-holed torus The shapes illustrated in figure 7 suggest an idea that can be viewed as the result of taking two one-holed tori, cutting disks out of both, gluing the results together across their boundary circles, and then smoothing the corners. This operation is depicted in figure 8. This sort of cutting and gluing operation is an example of whatis called a surgery. The analogous surgery can also be done with a one-holed torus and a two-holed torus to obtain a three-holed torus. And so on.
Thus, all of the oriented two-dimensional manifolds can be built using standard surgeries on copies of just two fundamental building blocks: the one-holed torus and the sphere. Here is a nice exercise to test your understanding ofthis process. Suppose that you perform a surgery, as in figure 8, on a sphere and another manifold that the resulting manifold is the same, with regard to M. Prove its topological and smooth structure, as M. sional manifolds can be built using a version of surgery As it turns out, all of the nonorientable two-dimen-

To be more precise, note that the Möbius strip has a circle as its boundary. Cut a disk out of any given orientable, two-dimensional manifold and the result also has a circular boundary. Glue the latter circular boundary to the Möbius strip boundary, smooth the corners, and the result is a smooth manifold that is nonorientable.
Every nonorientable, topological (and thus every nonorientable, smooth), two-dimensional manifold is obtained in this way. More over, the manifold you get depends only on the number of holes (the genus) of the orientable manifold that is used. The manifold obtained from the surgery of a Möbius strip with a sphere is called theone that uses the Möbius strip and the torus is called projective plane. The the Klein bottle.

One method How does one prove that the list given above exuses versions of the geometric techniques that are discussed below in the three-dimensional context. IV.7. Differential Topology 2.4 Dimension 3 There is now a complete classification of all smooth, three-dimensional manifolds; however, this is a very recent achievement.
There has been for some time a conjectured list of all three-dimensional manifolds, anda conjectured procedure for telling one from the other. The proof of these conjectures was recently completedby Grigori Perelman; this is a much-celebrated event in the mathematics community. The proof uses geometry about which more is said in the final part of this article. Here I shall concentrate on the classification scheme. essary to introduce the notion of aon a manifold.
Roughly speaking, this means a rule for Before getting to the classification scheme, it is nec-geometric structure defining the lengths of paths on the manifold. This rule must satisfy the following conditions. The con-stant path that simply stays at one point has length 0, but any path that moves at all has positive length. Sec - ond, if one path starts where another ends, the length of their concatenation (that is, the result of putting thetwo paths together) is the sum of their lengths.

Manifolds have them in spades. The following are three very useful geometric structures for the interior of the ball of radius 2 about the origin inn-dimensional Euclidean space.

With this goal in mind, suppose that Ihave specified some “standard” geometric structure$S$ for the ball in Rn to serve as a model of an exception- ally desirable structure. This could be one of the ones I have just defined or some other favorite. This leads to a corresponding notion of the structure S for a com- pact manifold.
Roughly speaking, one says that a geo-metric structure on a manifold is of the type S if every point in the manifold feels as though it belongs to the unit ball with the structure structure S on the ball to provide coordinate charts that S, that is, if one can use the respect the geometric structure on the manifold. To bemore precise, suppose that I am defining a coordinate system in a small neighborhood functionφ:$N \to R^{d}$.
If I can always do this in such a N of x by means of a way that the image that the distance between any two pointsφ(N) lies inside the ball, and suchx and y in Nφ(y)equals the distance between their images, defined in terms of the structure S on the ball,φ(x) and then I will say that the manifold has structure of type In particular, a geometric structure is said to be Euclid-S. eanb all is Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic, respectively., spherical, or hyperbolic when the structure on the For example, the sphere in any dimension has a spherical geometric structure (as it should!).
As it turns out, every two-dimensional manifold has a geometric structure that is either spherical, Euclidean, or hyper-bolic. More over, if it has a structure of one of these types, then it cannot have one of a different type. In particular, the sphere has a spherical structure, but not a Euclidean or hyperbolic structure. Meanwhile, the torus

402

in dimension 2 has a Euclidean geometric structure but only a Euclidean one, and all of the other manifolds listed in figure 7 have hyperbolic geometric structures and only hyperbolic ones. William Thurston had the great insight to realize that three-dimensional manifolds might be classifiable using geometric structures. In particular, he made what was known as the says, roughly speaking, that every three-dimensional geometrization conjecture, which manifold is made up of “nice” pieces:
Every smooth three-dimensional manifold can be cut ina canonical fashion along a predetermined set of two dimensional spheres and one-holed tori so that each ofthe resulting parts has precisely one of a list of eight possible geometric structures. Euclidean, and hyperbolic ones. These plus the other five are, in a sense that can be made precise, those The eight possible structures include the spherical, that are maximally symmetric.
The other five are associ-ated with various lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory), as are the listed three. Since its proof by Perelman, the geometrization conjecture has come to be known as the geometrization theorem. As I shall explain in a moment, this provides a satisfactory resolution of the three-dimensional part of the quest set out at the end of section 1. This is because a manifold with one of the eight geometric structures can be described in a canonical fashion using group theory.
As a result, the geometrization theorem turns the classification issue for manifolds into a ques-tion that group theory can answer. What follows is an indication of how this comes about. Each of the eight geometric structures has an associated ture. For example, in the case of the spherical structure, model space which has the given geometric struc the model space is the three-dimensional sphere. For the Euclidean structure, the model space is the three-dimensional Euclidean space.
For the hyperbolic structure, it is the hyperbola in the four-dimensional Euclid-ean space, where the coordinates(x, y, z, t) obey t2 =$1$+x2 + y2 + z2. In all of the eight cases, the model space has a canonical group of self-maps that preserve the distance between any two pairs of points. In the Euclidean case, this group is the group of translations and rotations of the three-dimensional Euclidean space.
In the spherical case, it is the group of rotations of the four-dimensional Euclidean space, and in the hyperbolic case, it is the group of Lorentz transformations of four-dimensional Minkowski space. The associated IV. Branches of Mathematics group of self-maps is called the given geometric structure. isometry group for the The connection between manifolds and group theory arises because a certain set of discrete subgroups of the isometry group of any one of the eight model spaces determines a compact manifold with the correspond-ing geometric structure.
(A subgroup is called discrete if every point in the subgroup is isolated, meaning that it belongs to a neighborhood that contains no other points from the subgroup.) This compact manifold is obtained as follows. Two points space are declared to be equivalentx andif there is an isom - y in the model etry T , belonging to the subgroup, such that T x = y . In other words, isometries from the subgroup. It is easy to check thatx is equivalent to all its images under this notion of equivalence is a genuine relation [I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar).
The equivalence classes are then equivalence in one-to-one correspondence with the points of the associated compact manifold.

Given a point possible images under translations from the sub grou pt in the real line, the are all the numbers of the form$t + 2nπ$, where n is an integer, so one regards two real numbers as equivalent if they differ by a multiple of 2π, and the equivalence class oft is t + 2 nπ: n \in Z. One can associate with this equivalence class the point(x, y) = (. os  t, . in  t) in the circle, since adding a multiple of 2 not affect either its sine or its cosine.

In Even before Perelman’s work there was a tremendous order to discuss this evidence, a small digression isrequired to give some of the background. First, I need to bring in the notion of a sphere.

(Think of the knot as the copper in an insu-I also need the notion of surgery on a link. To this end, lated wire and view the solid tube as the copper plus the surrounding insulation.) Notice that the boundary of any given component tube is really a copy of ourone-holed torus from figure 7.
Therefore, removing any one of the tubes leaves a tubular-shaped missing region from the three-dimensional sphere whose boundary is a torus. Now, to define a surgery, imagine removing a knotted tube and then gluing it back in a different way. That is, imagine gluing the boundary of the tube to the boundary of the resulting missing region using an identifica-tion that is not the same as the original. For example, take the “unknot,” a standard round circle in a given plane, here viewed as living inside a coordinate chart of the three-dimensional sphere.
Take out the solid tube around it, and then replace the tube by gluing the boundary in the “wrong” way, as follows. Consider the left most torus in figure 11 as the boundary of the complement of the tube in R3. Consider the middle torus as the inside of the tube. The “wrong” gluing identifies the circles marked “R” and “L” on the left most torus with their counterparts on the middle torus. The result-ing space is a three-dimensional manifold which turns out to be the product of the circle with the two-dimensional sphere.
That is to say, it is the set of ordered pairs(x, y), where x is a point in the circle and y is a point in the two-dimensional sphere. There are many other possible ways to glue the boundary torus, and almost all of the corresponding surgeries give rise todistinct three-dimensional manifolds. One of these is illustrated in the right most part of figure 11.In general, given any link one can construct a countably infinite set of distinct, smooth three - dimensional 403 manifolds by using surgeries on it.
Further more, Ray-mond Lickorish proved that every three-dimensional manifold can be obtained by using surgery on some link in the three-dimensional sphere. Unfortunately, this character ization of three-dimensional manifolds via surgeries on links does not provide a satisfactory resolution to the central quest of classifying smooth structures because the process is far from unique: for any given manifold there is a bewildering assortment of links and surgeries that can be used to produce it.
More over, as of this writing, there is no known way to clas-sify knots and links in the three-dimensional sphere. for his geometrization conjecture. Given any link, allbut finitely many of the three-dimensional manifolds In any event, here is a taste of Thurston’s evidence you can produce from it by surgery satisfy the conclu-sions of the geometrization conjecture.
Thurston also proved that, given any knot apart from the unknot, allbut finitely many surgeries on it produce a manifold with a hyperbolic geometric structure. By the way, Perelman’s proof of the geometrization theorem gives as a special case a proof of the Poincaré conjecture we need the notion of a, proposed by Poincaré in 1904. To state this simply connected manifold. This is a manifold with the property that any closed loop init can be shrunk down to a point.
To be more precise, designate a point in the manifold as the “base point.”Then any path in the manifold that starts and ends at the chosen base point can be continuously deformedin such a way that at each stage of the deformation the path still starts and ends at the base point, and so that the end result is the trivial path that starts at the base point and just stays there.
For example, the two dimensional sphere is simply connected, but the torus is not, since a loop that goes “once around” the torus (for example, any of the loops R or L in the various tori of figure 11) cannot be shrunk to a point. In fact, a sphere is the only two-dimensional manifold that is simply connected, and spheres are simply connected inall dimensions greater than 1.

The so - called “Some of the topological manifolds in dimension 4 do118 conjecture” proposes necessary and sufficient conditions for a four - dimensional, topological manifold to have at least one smooth structure. The fraction refers to the absolute value of the ratio of the rank118 here to the signature of a certain symmetric, bilinear form that appears in the four-dimensional story. The case 0 excepted, the conjecture asserts that a smooth struc-ture exists if and only if this ratio is at least 11 .
The0 bilinear form in question is obtained by counting with8 signed weights the intersection points between vari-ous two-dimensional surfaces inside the given fourdimensional manifold. In this regard, note that a typi-cal pair of two-dimensional surfaces in four dimensions will intersect at finitely many points. This is a higher-dimensional analogue of a fact that is rather easier to visualize: that a typical pair of loops in the two - dimen-sional plane will intersect at finitely many points. Not surprisingly, the bilinear form here is called the intersection form classification theorems.;
it plays a prominent role in Freedman’s Meanwhile, the problem of listing all smooth structures is wide open in four dimensions: there are no cases of a topological manifold with at least one smooth structure where the list of distinct struc-tures is known to be complete. Some topological fourdimensional manifolds are known to have (countably) infinitely many distinct smooth structures. For oth-ers there is only one known structure. For example, the four-dimensional sphere has one obvious smooth structure and this is the only one known.
However, the underlying topological manifold may, for all any-one knows, have many distinct smooth structures. By the way, the story for noncompact manifolds in dimen - sion 4 is truly bizarre. For example, it is known that there are uncountably many smooth manifolds that are homeomorphic to the standard, four-dimensional Euclidean space. But even here, our understanding is IV.

This was done some time ago by Stephen Smale with input from John Stallings. In these higher dimensions it is also possible to say what conditions need to hold in order for a topological manifold to admit a smooth structure.
For example, John Milnor and others determined that the respective number of smooth structures on the spheres of dimensions 5–18 are as follows: 1, 1, 28, 2, 8, 6, 992,1, 3, 2, 16 256, 2, 16, 16.

the disk comes back to intersect itself, then you can push the part of M that is very near the disk along the L disk while stretching the remaining part to keep things from tearing. If you extend the disk a bit past$MR$, then you will have removed two of the intersection points when you have pushed past the end of the disk. Figure 12 is a schematic of this. This pushing operation(the Whitney trick) can be performed in any manifold of any dimension if you can find the required disk. The problem is to find the disk.
Figure 13 is a drawing of across-sectional slice showing a “good” disk on the left and some badly chosen disks in the middle and on the right. If you have a badly chosen disk that nevertheless satisfies the required boundary conditions, then you might hope to find a tiny wiggle of its interior that makes it better. You would like the new disk to have noself-intersection points and you would like its interior to be disjoint from both direction that is parallel to the disk itself will help, for ML and MR.
No wiggle along a any such wiggle only changes the position of the intersection point in the disk. Likewise, a wiggle in a direc-tion parallel to the offending ML or MR is use less since it only changes the position of the intersection point in the latter space. Thus, 2+ n of the 2 n dimensions are use less when it comes to wiggling a disk. However, there are 2 n - (n + 2) = n - 2 remaining dimensions to work with, which is a positive number when 2 fact, when this is true a generic wiggle in any of these$n > 4$.
In extra dimensions does the trick. Now, when 2 n = 4 (so n = 2) there are no extra dimensions, and, consequently, no small wiggle can make a new disk with out intersection points. So if a given candidate disk intersects$MR$, then the Whitney trick just trades the old pair of intersection points fora new collection. If the disk intersects either itself or Mpoints: that is, points where one part has come around L, then the new version of$M^{L} \text{has self} - intersection$ to intersect another. This failure of the Whitney trick is the bane of four-dimensional topology.
Thus, a major lemma for Michael Freedman’s classification theorem about topological four-dimensional manifolds describes ubiquitous circumstances where a topologically (but not smoothly!) embedded disk can be found for use in the Whitney trick. 3 How Geometry Enters the Fray Much of our current understanding about smooth man-ifolds in dimensions 4 or less has come via what

might be called geometric techniques. The search for acanonical geometric structure on a given three-dimensional manifold is an example. Perelman’s proof of the geometrization theorem proceeds in this manner. The idea is to choose any convenient geometric structure on a given three-dimensional manifold and then con-tinuous ly deform it by some well-defined rule. If one views the deformation as a time-dependent process, then the goal is to design the deformation rule to make the geometric structure ever more symmetric as time goes on.
A rule introduced and much studied by Richard Hamilton and then used by Perelman specifies the time-derivative of the geometric structure at any given time in terms of certain of its properties at that time. It is a nonlinear version of the classical[I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).

The idea much studied by Hamilton and then by Perelman is to let the evolving geometric structure decompose the manifold into the canonical pieces that are predicted to exist by the geometrization conjecture.

In this case, geometrically defined data are used to distinguish smooth structures on topologically equivalent manifolds. What follows isa very brief sketch of how this is done. To begin with, the idea is to introduce a geometric structure on the manifold and then to use the latter to define a canonical system of partial differential equations.
In any given coordinate chart, these equations arefor a particular set of functions. The equations state that certain linear combinations of the collection of first derivatives of the functions from the set are equal to terms that are linear and quadratic in the values of the functions themselves.

Families: modulate?how do we allow our objects to vary, or In this article we will discuss what these ingredients sig-nify, as well as what it means to solve a moduli problem, and we will give some indications as to why this might be a good thing to do.

(Moduli spaces in topology are often algebraic geom-algebraic toreferred to asgive a geometric structure to the classifying spaces.) The basic idea is tototality of the objects we are trying to classify. If we can understand this geo-metric structure, then we obtain powerful insights into the geometry of the objects themselves. Further more, moduli spaces are rich geometric objects in their own right.
They are “meaningful” spaces, in that any state-ment about their geometry has a “modular” interpretation, in terms of the original classification problem. As a result, when one investigates them one can often reach much further than one can with other spaces.
moduli spaces such as the moduli of elliptic curves [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) (which we discuss below) play a central role in a vari-ety of areas that have no immediate link to the geometry being classified, in particular in algebraic number theory the study of moduli spaces has benefited tremendously[IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) and algebraic topology. More over, in recent years from interactions with physics (in par-ticular with string theory [IV.17 §2](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras)).

All we have to do is take standard Cartesian coordinatesθ(L) between the linex, y on the plane and measure the angle L and the x-axis, taken in coun- ter clockwise fashion. We find that the possible valuesofθ are those for which 0 ⩽ θ < π, and that for every suchofθ with theθ there is exactly one linex-axis. So as a set L, we have a complete that makes an angle solution to our classification problem:

We haveHowever, we are seeking a geometric solution to the a natural notion of when two lines are near each other,which our solution should capture—in other words, the collection of lines has a natural topology [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces). So far, our solution does not reflect the fact that lines L for which the angle θ(L) is close to π are almost horizontal:
they are therefore close to thewhichθ = 0) and to the lines L with θ(L) close to zero.x-axis (for We need to find some way of “wrapping around” the interval[0, π) so that π becomes close to 0. One way to do this is to take not the half-open interval“identify” the points 0 and[0, π) but the closed intervalπ. (This idea can easily be[0, π], and then to made formal by defining an appropriate relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar).) Ifπ and 0 are regarded as the equivalence same, then numbers close to close to 0.

To each point s \in RP(S1)1., there is an obvious way of assigning a line L(s): take the line that passes through have a family of lines parametrized bys and the origin. Thus, we S1, that is, a map (or function)in our set RP1 s.
What is important about this is that we\to  L(s) that takes points in S1 to lines already know what it means for two points in S1 to be close to each other, and the map$s \to L(s) \text{is continu}-$ ous. However, this map is a two-to-one function rather than a bijection, sinces and -s always give the same line. To remedy this, we can identify each cle S1 with its antipodal point -s. We then have a one-s in the cir- to-one correspondence between RP1 and the resulting quotient space [I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) (which again is topologically

a circle), and this correspondence is continuous in both directions. The key feature of the space RP1, considered as the moduli space the ways in which lines canof lines in the plane, is that it captures modulate, or vary continuously in families. But when do families of lines arise?A good example is provided by the following construction. Whenever we have a continuous curve C ⊂ R2 \ 0 in the plane, we can assign to each point L(c) that passes through 0 and c. This gives us a fam i lyc in C the line of lines parametrized bytakesc to L(c) is a continuous function from C.
More over, the function that C to RP1, so the parametrization is a continuous one. Suppose, for example, that C is a copy of R realized as the set of points C to RP1 gives an isomorphism between(x, 1) at height 1. Then the map from R and the set{L}:$θ(L) \neq 0$, which is the subset of RP1 consisting of all lines apart from thewe have an intuitive notion of what it means for a col - x - axis. Put more abstractly, lection of lines through the origin to depend continu-ously on some parameters, and this notion is captured precisely by the geometry of RP1:
for instance, if you tell me you have a continuous 37-parameter family of lines in R2, this is the same as saying that you have a continuous map fromv \in R37 to a line L(v)R37\in to RPRP1. (More concretely, we1, which sends a point could say that the real function$v \to θ(L(v)) on R37$ is continuous away from the locus whereθ is close toπthat measures the angle from the. Near this locus we could use instead the functiony -axis.) φ

1.1 Other Families

The idea of families of lines leads to various other geo-metric structures on the space RP1, and not just its topological structure. For example, we have the notionof a differentiable family of lines in the plane, which is a family of lines for which the angles vary differ en-tiably. (The same ideas apply if we replace “differentiable” by “measurable,” “$C \infty$,” “real analytic,” etc.) To parametrize such a family appropriately, we would like RP1 to be a [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), so that we can calculate derivatives of functions on it.
Such astructure on differentiable manifold RP1 can be specified by using the angle functions functionθθgives us a coordinate for lines that are notand φdefined in the previous section. The too close to thex - axis, and φ gives us a coordinate for lines that are not too close to the cu late derivatives of functions on RPy - axis. We can cal - 1 by writing them in terms of these coordinates. One can justify this dif-ferentiable structure on RP1 by checking that for any 410 differentiable curve C ⊂ R2 \ 0 the map c \to L(c) comes out as differentiable.
This means that ifto thex - axis, then the function x \to θ(L(x))L(c) is not close is differentiable at The functionsx = xc\to , and similarly forθ(L(x)) and \to φ(L(x))φ and theare call edy - axis. pullbacks“pulling back,”, because they are the result of converting, orθ and φfrom functions defined on RP1 to functions defined on We now can state the fundamental property of C. RP1 as a differentiable space.
A differentiable family of lines in R2 parametrized by a differentiable manifold tion from X to RP1, taking a point X is the same thing as a func-x to a line L(x), such that the pullbacksx \to  θ(L(x)) and x \to  φ(L(x)) of the functionsθ, φare differentiable functions. We say that RP1 (with its differentiable structure) is the lines in moduli space R2. This means thatof (differentiably varying families of)RP1 carries the universal differentiable family of lines we have assigned to each point of.
From the very definition, RP1 a line in R2, and these lines vary differentiably as we vary the point.
The above assertion says that lines, parametrized by a space any differentiable family of X, is described by giv- ing a map f: X \to  RP1 and assigning to x \in  X the line L(f (x)).

1.2 Reformulation: Line Bundles

It is interesting to reformulate the notion of a (continu-ous or differentiable) family of lines as follows. Let X be a space and let points in X. For each pointx \to  L(x) be an assignment of lines tox \in  X, we place a copy of R^2$at$ X . imes x; in other words, we consider the Cartesian product R2. We may now visualize the line L(x) as living in the copy of R2 that lies overx. This gives us a contin- uously varying collection of lines byx \in  X, otherwise known as a line bundle L(x) parametrized over X.
More over, this line bundle is embedded in the “trivial”vector bundle [IV.6 §5](/part-04/algebraic-topology)$X \times R^{2}$, which is the constant assignment that takes each case when$X$ is RP1 itself, we have a “tautological” line$x \text{to the plane} R^{2}$. In the bundle: to each point$s \in RP^{1}$, which we can think of as a line$L^{s} in R^{2}$, it assigns that very same line Ls. Proposition. For any topological space X there is a natural bijection between the following two sets: (i) the set of continuous functions$f$:$X \to RP^{1}$;
and (ii)the trivial vector bundle the set of line bundles on X X. imes  that are contained in R2.

1.3 Invariants of Families

Associated with any continuous function circle S1 to itself is an integer known as itsf from the degree. Roughly speaking, the degree oftimesf (x) goes around the circle whenf is the number ofx goes around once. (If it goes backwards degree is-n.) Another way to think of the degree is asn times, then we say that the the number of times a typical point in S1 is passed byf (x)as +1 if it is passed in the counter clockwise directionas x goes around the circle, where we count this$and$-1 if it is passed in the clockwise direction.
Earlier, we showed that the circle$S^{1}$, which we obtained by identifying the endpoints of the closed interval[0, π], could be used to parametrize the mod- uli space RP1 of lines. Combining this with the notion of degree, we can draw some interesting conclusions. In particular, we can define the notion of winding numbersγ from the circle. Suppose that we are given a continuous function S1 into the plane R2 and suppose that it avoids 0. The image of this map will be a closed loop$C$(which may cross itself). This defines for us a map from then work out S1 to itself:
first do L(c), which belongs toγ to obtain a point RP1, and final lyc in C, use the parametrization of RP1 to associate with L(c) a point in S1 again. The degree of the resulting compos- ite map will be hence C, winds around 0, so half this number is defined twice the number of times thatγ, and to be the winding number of More generally, given a family of lines inγ.

The way this assignment works does not change if invariant ofφbelongs to in the firstφ. What it does depend on is the class that cohomology group[IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of space X, HX^1(X, which is contained in the trivial Z). Equivalently, to any line bundle on a R2 - bundle, we have associated a cohomology class, known as the Euler class of the bundle.
This is the first example of a characteristic class [IV.6 §5](/part - 04/algebraic - topology) for vector bundles. It demonstrates that if we understand the topology of moduli spaces of classes of geometric objects, then we can define topological invariants for families of those objects. 2 The Moduli of Curves and Teichmüller Spaces We now turn our attention to perhaps the most famous examples of moduli spaces, the moduli spaces of curves, and their first cousins, the Teichmüller spaces.
These moduli spaces are the geometric solution to the problem of classification of compact Riemann surfaces, and can be thought of as the “higher theory” of Rie-mann surfaces. The moduli spaces are “meaningful spaces,” in that each of their points stands for a Rie-mann surface. As a result, any statement about their geometry tells us something about the geometry of Riemann surfaces. surfaceented) to which a We turn first to the objects.

Riemann Complex structures can be described in many ways, and they enable us to do complex analysis, geometry, and algebra on the surface us to define holomorphic$X$[I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) (complex - analytic). In particular, they enable andof Xmer om or ph ic functions.
To be precise, X is a two-dimensional manifold,[V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem) on open subsets but the charts are thought of as open subsets of rather than of R, and the maps that glue them together C are required to be holomorphic. An equivalent notionis that of a conformal structure on X, which is the structure needed to make it possible to define angles between curves in X. Yet another important equivalent notion is that ofinto a complex-algebraic curve algebraic structure(leading to the persis - on X , making X tent confusion in terminology:
a Riemann surface is two dimensional, and therefore a surface, from the point of view of topology or the real numbers, but one dimen - sional, and therefore a curve, from the point of view of 411 complex analysis and algebra). An algebraic structure iswhat allows us to speak of polynomial, rational, or algebraic functions on$X$, and is usually specified by realizingin complex X as the set of solutions to polynomial equations[III.72](/part-03/projective-space) CP2 (or CPn).

(We postpone the discussion of the final ingre-dient, the notion of families of Riemann surfaces, to section 2.2.) To do this, we must give a notion ofmorphism between Riemann surfaces: when should twoiso Riemann surfaces X and Ybe “identified,” or thought of as giving two equivalent realizations of the same underlying object of our classification?
This issue was hidden in our toy example of classifying lines in the plane: there we simply identified two lines if and only if they were equal as lines in the plane. This naive option is not available to us with the more abstractly defined Riemann surfaces. If we considered Riemann surfaces realized concretely as subsets of some larger space—for example, as solution sets to algebraic equations in complex projective space—we could similarly choose to identify surfaces only if they were equal as subsets. However, this is too fine a classification for most applications:
what we care about is the geometry of Riemann surfaces, and not incidental fea-intrinsic tures that result from the particular way we choose to realize them. At the other extreme, we might choose to ignore the extra geometric structure that makes a surface into a Riemann surface. That is, we could identify two Riemann surfaces X and Y if they are topologically equiva- lent, or homeomorphic (the “coffee mug is a doughnut”perspective).
The classification of compact Riemann surfaces up to topological equivalence is captured by a single positive integer, the genus$g$(“number of holes”) of the surface. Any surface of genus zero is homeomor-phic to the Riemann sphere CP1$≃ S^{2}$, any surface of genus 1 is homeomorphic to a torus$S1 \times S1$, and so on. Thus, in this case there is no issue of “modulation”—the classification is solved by giving a list of possible values of a single discrete invariant. as Riemann surfaces manifolds, then this classification is too crude:
it com-However, if we are interested in Riemann surfaces rather than simply as topological pletely ignores the complex structure. We would now like to refine our classification to remedy this defect. To this end, we say that two Riemann surfaces(conformally, or holomorphically) equivalent X andif there is Y are

412

a topological equivalence between them that preserves the geometry, i.e., a homeomorphism that preserves the angles between curves, or takes holomorphic functionsto holomorphic functions, or takes rational functions to rational functions. (These conditions are all equiv-alent.) Note that we still have at our disposal our discrete invariant—the genus of a surface. However, as we shall see, this invariant is not fine enough to distinguish between all in equivalent Riemann surfaces.
In fact, it ispossible to have families of in equivalent Riemann surfaces that are parametrized by(but we cannot make proper sense of this idea until we continuous parameters have said precisely what is meant by a family of Rie-mann surfaces). Thus, the next step is to fix our discrete invariant and to try to classify all the different isomor-phism classes of Riemann surfaces with the same genus by assembling them in a natural geometric fashion.
uniformization theorem simply connected Riemann surface is holomorphically An important step toward this classification is the[V.34](/part-05/the-uniformization-theorem). This states that any isomorphic to one of the following three: the Rie-mann sphere CP1, the complex plane C, or the upper half-plane H (equivalently, the unit disk D). Since the universal covering space surface is a simply connected Riemann surface, the[III.93](/part-03/universal-covers) of any Riemann uniformization theorem provides an approach to clas-sify ing arbitrary Riemann surfaces.
For instance, any compact ply connected, and in fact homeomorphic to the Rie-[III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) Riemann surface of genus zero is sim mann sphere, so the uniformization theorem already solves our classification problem in genus zero: up to equivalence, CP1 is the only Riemann surface of genus zero, and so in this case the topological and conformal classifications agree.

2.1 Moduli of Elliptic Curves

Next, we consider Riemann surfaces whose universal cover is C, which is the same as saying that they are quotients ofof C by Z, which means that we regard two complex C. For example, we can look at a quotient numbers This has the effect of “wrap pi ngz and w as equivalent if Ca round” into a cylin-z - w is an integer. der. Cylinders are not compact, but to get a compact surface we could take a quotient by Z2 instead: that is, we could regard ference is of the formz anda +wbi, where as equivalent if their dif-a and b are both integers.
Now C is wrapped around in two directions and the result is a torus with a complex (or, equiva-lently, conformal or algebraic) structure. This is a compact Riemann surface of genus 1. More generally, we

A basis for a lattice L is a pair of complex numbers that everyz in L can be written in the formu and v belonging toau L+suchbv with for example, ifa and bintegers.
Such a basis will not be unique: L = Z⊕Z, then the obvious basis is u = 1 and well.) If we take a quotient ofv = i, but u = 1 and v = C1 by a lattice, then we+ i would do just as again obtain a torus with complex structure. It turns out that any compact Riemann surface of genus 1 can be produced in this way. From a topological point of view, any two tori are the same, but once we consider the complex structure we start to find that different choices of lattice may leadto different Riemann surfaces. Certain changes to L do not tice have an effect:
for example, if we multiply a lat - L by some nonzero complex number λ, then the quotient surface is naturally isomorphic to C/Lwill not be affected. That is, C/. ambda L. Therefore, we need C/L only worry about the difference between lattices when one is not a multiple of the other. Geometrically, this says that one cannot be obtained from the other by a combination of rotation and dilation. Notice that by taking the quotient C/L we obtain not just a “naked” Riemann surface, but one equipped withan “origin,” that is, a distinguished point e \in E, which is the image of the origin 0\in  C.
In other words, we obtain an elliptic curve: Definition.face E of genus 1, equipped with a marked point An elliptic curve (over C) is a Riemann sur-e \in  E. Elliptic curves, up to isomorphism, are in bijection with lattices L ⊂ C up to rotation.

This of symmetries, or automorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions): there is always a holomorphic automorphism ofpointx to any other given point y . (If we think of E taking any E

as a group, these are achieved by translations.) Thus, if some one hands us another genus-1 surface E^ , there may be no way to identify E with E^ , or there may be infinitely many ways: we can always compose a given isomorphism between them with a self-symmetry of E. As we will discuss later, automorphisms haunt almost every moduli problem, and are crucial when we consider the behavior of families. It is usually convenient to “rigidify” the situation some what, so that the pos-sible isomorphisms between different objects are less “floppy” and more uniquely determined.
In the case of elliptic curves, distinguishing the point by reducing the symmetry of E. Once we do that, theree achieves this is usually at most one way to identify two elliptic curves (one way, that is, that takes origin to origin). choice of a marked point) can be described by concrete“linear algebra data”: a lattice We see that Riemann surfaces of genus 1 (with the L ⊂ C, or rather the equiv- alence class consisting of all nonzero scalar multiples. ambda L of L. This is the ideal setting to study a classification, or moduli, problem.
The next step is to find an explicit parametrization of the collection of all lattices, up to multiplication, and to decide in what sense we have obtained a geometric solution to the classification problem. follow a procedure used for all moduli problems: first parametrize lattices together with the choice of some In order to parametrize the collection of lattices, we additional structure, and then see what happens when we forget this choice. For every lattice basisω, ω \in L: that is, we represent L we choose a L as the set of all integer combinations1 2 aω1 + bω2.
We do this in an parallelogram oriented fashion: we require that the spanned byω and ω is positively ori-fundamental ented. (That is, the numbers 0,1ω1, ω1 2+ω2, and ω2 list the vertices of the parallelogram in a counterclockwis eorder. From the geometric point of view of the elliptic curve E, L is the fundamental group[IV.6 §2](/part - 04/algebraic - topology) of E, and the orientation condition says that we generateby two loops, or “meridians,”$A = ω$, B = ω , which L are oriented, in that their oriented intersection num - ber A ∩ B is equal to + 1 rather than1 - 1.)

the set of all integer combinations a + bω of 1 and ω) and no two of these lattices are related by a rotation. What does this tell us about elliptic curves? We saw earlier that an elliptic curve is defined by a lattice an identitye. Now we have seen that if we give L Lso me and extra structure, namely an oriented basis, then we can parametrize it by a complex numberω \in H. This makes precise for us the “additional structure” that we wantto place on elliptic curves.
We say that a marked elliptic curve is an elliptic curve of an oriented basisω1, ωE, e2 for the associated lattice together with the choice (fundamental group)L of E. The point is that any lattice has infinitely many different bases, which lead to many automorphisms of E. By “marking” one of these bases, we stop them being automorphisms. 2.2 Families and Teichmüller Spaces With our new definition, we can summarize the earlier discussion by saying that marked elliptic curves are inbijection with pointsω \in H of the upper half - plane.
The upper half-plane is, however, much more than justa set of points: it carries a host of geometric structures, in particular a topology and a complex structure. Inwhat sense do these structures reflect geometric properties of marked elliptic curves? In other words, in what sense is the complex manifold H, known in this context as the faces with one marked point, a geometric solution to Teichmüller space T1\\\{,\\\}1 of genus - 1 Riemann sur- the problem of classifying marked elliptic curves? of a continuous family of Riemann surfaces, and also the notion of a complex-analytic family.

A good criterion for a family of Riemann surfaces is likewise that any“reasonably defined” geometric quantity that we can calculate for every Riemann surface should vary continuously in the family.
For example, a classical con-struc tion of Riemann surfaces of genusg comes from 414 taking 4 resulting Riemann surface is fully determined by theg-gons and gluing opposite sides together. The edge-lengths and angles of the polygon. Therefore, acontinuous family of Riemann surfaces described in this fashion should be precisely a family such that the edge-lengths and angles give continuous functions of the parameter set. lection In more abstract topological terms, if we have a col-\.

We should demand that this map is or fiber bundle). This definition has the advantage of great flexibility.
For example, if S is a complex man- ifold, then in just the same way we can speak of a complex-analytic family of Riemann surfaces$\\{X }$, s . ns S\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} parametrized by S: now we ask for the union of the X to carry not just a topology but a complex struc-s

ture (i.e., it should form a complex manifold), extend-ing the complex structure on the fibers and mapping holomorphically to the parameter set. The same holds with “complex-analytic” replaced by “algebraic.” These abstract definitions have the property that if our Rie-mann surfaces are described in a concrete way—cut out by equations, glued from coordinate patches, etc.—then the coefficients of our equations or gluing data will vary as complex-analytic functions in our family pre-cisely when the family is complex analytic (and likewise for continuous or algebraic families).
As a reality check, note that a (continuous, analytic, or other) family of Riemann surfaces parametrized bya single points = S is indeed just a single Riemann surfaces i der Riemann surfaces only up to equivalence, so there Xs.

We simply regard the families as equivalent if X ands X^ are isomorphic for everys s, and if the isomorphism depends analytically onss s.
Armed with the notion of family, we can now formulate the characteristic property that the upper half-plane possesses when we think of it as the moduli space of marked elliptic curves. We define a continuous or IV.

This expresses the fact that S = H itself, mapping Hthe collection of Riemann surfaces defined by itself carries a family of marked elliptic curves, i.e.,ω \in Hfit together into a complex manifold fibering over H with elliptic curve fibers. This family is called the family, since by the theorem any family is “deduced”universal (or pulled back) from this one universal example.
2.3 From Teichmüller Spaces to Moduli Spaces We have arrived at a complete and satisfying picture for the classification of elliptic curves when we choose in addition a marking (that is, an oriented basis of the associated lattice$L = π (E))$. What can we say about elliptic curves themselves, with out the choice of mark - ing? We some how need to “forget” the marking, by1 regarding two points of H as equivalent if they correspond to two different markings of the same elliptic curve.
Z⊕Now, given any two bases of the group (or lattice)Z, there is an invertible 2 . imes 2 matrix with integer entries that takes one basis to the other. If the two bases are oriented, then this matrix will have determinant 1, which means that it is an element A = ac bd \in SL2(Z) IV.8. Moduli Spaces of the group of invertible unimodular matrices over Z. Similarly, given any two oriented bases(ω , ω ) andas oriented identifications of(ω1, ω2) of a lattice L, which can be thought of L with Z ⊕ Z, there is (a1)2 matrix$ω = Acω\in + SLdω2(Z)$.
If we now consider the normal-such that ω1 = aω1 + bω2 and ized basesω2^ = ω^ /ω1(1^ , then we obtain a transformation of the$, ω) and2 (1, ω)$, where ω = ω1/ω2 and upper half-plane. It is given by the formula1 2ω^ = aωcω ++ db.

If this is the case, then we should regard the two points as equivalent: that is how we formalize the idea of “for getting” the marking.

This quotient space has complex-analytic structure, which, it turns out, identi-fies it with the complex plane C itself.
To see this one uses the classicala complex-analytic function on modular function H which is invariant[IV.1 §8](/part-04/number-theory)j(z), under the modular group Psl defines a natural coordinate H2/(ZPSL) and which therefore(Z) \to  C. lem for elliptic curves: we have a topological, and even complex-analytic, space It appears that we have solved the moduli prob-M=2 H/ PSL (Z) whose points are in one-to-one correspondence with isomor-phism classes of elliptic curves.
This already qualifies1,1 2 M1,1 as the coarse moduli space for elliptic curves, which means it is as good a moduli space as we can hope for. However, M fails an important test for a moduli space thatit is not true, even for the circle(T1()\\\{}},\\){1}passed (as we saw in section 2.2):1$,1 S = S1$, that every con- tinuous family of elliptic curves overa map from S to M .

Note that this is the same - 1 that we quotiented out by to pass from SLtwo special lattices that have greater symmetry. These2(Z) to PSL2(Z).
However, there are are the square lattice$L = Z · 1 ⊕ Z · i$, corresponding to the fourth root of unity i, and the L = Z · 1 ⊕ Z · (e2()π){i}/ 6, corresponding to a sixth root ofhexagonal lattice unity. (Note that the hexagonal lattice is also repre-sented by the pointω = (e2()π){i}/ 3.) The square lattice, which corresponds to the elliptic curve formed by gluing the opposite sides of a square, has as its symmetries the group Z/4 Z of rotational symmetries of the square.
The hexagonal lattice, which corresponds to the ellip-tic curve formed by gluing the opposite sides of a regular hexagon, has as its symmetries the group Z$/6Z of$ rotational symmetries of a hexagon. We see that the number of automorphisms of an elliptic curve jumps discontinuously at the special pointsω = i and ω = (e2()π){i}/ 6. This already suggests that some- thing might be wrong with M1,1 as a moduli space. Note that we avoided this problem with the moduli T of marked elliptic curves, since there are no auto- morphisms of an elliptic curve that also preserve the marking.
Another place we might have observed this1$, {}^{1}$ problem with H$/ PSL (Z)$. We avoided the automorphism M1^,1 is when we passed to the quotientλ = −1 by quotienting by PSLthe two special points i and e2 2(Z) rather than SL2^πi^/6 are preserved by2(Z).

If for every complex num berz you identify z with -z, then the result is to wrap the complex plane around into a cone with a sin-gularity at 0. The reason 0 is singled out is that it is preserved by the transform at io nz → −z.
Here the angle would beto-one away from the singularity andπbecause the identification of points is two-π is half of 2π.) It is possible to massage these singularities away using the$j$-function, but they are indicating a basic difficulty. So why do automorphisms form an obstacle to the existence of “good” moduli spaces? We can demon-strate the difficulty by considering an interesting con-

tinuous family of marked elliptic curves parametrized by the circle S = S1. Let E(i)be the “square” elliptic curve that we considered earlier, based on the lattice of integer combinations of 1 and i. Next, for every between 0 and 1, let Et be a copy of E(i). Thus, we havet taken the constant, or “trivial,” family of elliptic curves over the closed unit interval[0, 1], where every curve in the family is E(i). Now we identify the elliptic curves at the two ends of this family, not in the obvious way, butby using the automorphism given by a 90◦ rotation, or multiplication by i.
This means that we are looking atthe family of elliptic curves over the circle where each member of the family is a copy of the elliptic curve but these copies twist by 90◦ as we go around the circle. E(i), family of elliptic curves by means of a map from the space It is easy to see that there is no way to capture this M . Since all of the members of the family$S^{1} to$ are isomorphic, each point of the circle should map tothe same point in1,1 M (the equivalence class of i in Hthe).

Thus, there E(i) but are more families of elliptic curves than there are mapsto M ; the quotient space H/ PSL (Z) cannot handle the complications caused by automorphisms. A variant of this construction applies to complex-analytic fami-1,1 2 lies with S1 replaced by C. imes . This is a very general phe- nomenon in moduli problems: whenever objects have nontrivial automorphisms, we can imitate the construction above to get nontrivial families over an interesting parameter set, all of whose members are the same.
As a result, they cannot be classified by a map to the set of all isomorphism classes. What do we do about this problem? One approach is to resign ourselves to having coarse moduli spaces, which have the right points and right geometry but do not quite classify arbitrary families. Another approachis the one that leads to$T$: we can fix markings of one kind or another, which “kill” all automorphisms. In other words, we choose enough extra structure on1,1 our objects so that there do not remain any (nontriv-ial) automorphisms that preserve all this decoration.

For each would like to define a space M , called the mod ulig we space of curves of genus mann surfaces of genus gg, that classifies compact Rie-and tells us how they modu-$g$ late.
Thus, the points of Mg should correspond to our objects, compact Riemann surfaces of genus be more accurate, equivalence classes of such surfaces, g, or, to where two surfaces are considered to be equivalent if there is a complex-analytic isomorphism between them. In addition, we would likeit can to embody the structure of continuous fami-Mg to do the best lies of genus-M parametrizing “g surfaces. Likewise, there are spac esn-punctured” Riemann surfaces of genus surfaces, but Riemann surfaces together with a “deco-g, n g.
This means we consider not “bare” Riemann ration” or “marking” byn distinct labeled points (punc- tures). Two of these are considered to be equivalent if there is a complex-analytic isomorphism between them that takes punctures to punctures and preserves labels. Since there are Riemann surfaces with automorphisms, we do not expect M to be able to classify all families of Riemann surfaces: that is, we will expect examples similar to the twisted square-lattice construction dis-$g$ cussed earlier.
However, if we consider Riemann sur-faces with enough extra markings, then we will be able to obtain a moduli space in the strongest sense. Oneway to choose such markings is to consider M with nto mark generators of the fundamental group, leading large enough (for fixedg). Another approach will beg, n to the Teichmüller spaces Tg and Tg, n. We now out line this process. To construct the space M , we return to the uniformization theorem.

3.1 Digression: “Abstract Nonsense”

It is interesting to note that, while we have yet tosee why such a space exists, it follows from general, nongeometric principles—“abstract nonsense”—that it is completely and uniquely category theory [III.8](/part-03/categories) or determined, both as a topological space and as a com-plex manifold, by this characteristic property. In a very abstract way, every topological space M can be uniquely reconstructed from its set of points, the set of paths between these points, the set of surfaces spanning these paths, and so on.
To put it differently, we can choice of a basepoint, choosing a path from1. Note that while the fundamental group of$xπto^{1}(X$, x)y, and the different choices are related byandπ1(X, y)may be identified by X depends on the conjugation by a loop. Thus, if we are willing to identify sets of gener-ators$A^{i}$, Biwhen they differ only by a conjugation, then we can ignore the choice of a basepoint.

3.2 Moduli Spaces and Representations

In otherπ1(X) Γg, to obtain the mod- words, we would like to takeg Tg and identify any two points that represent the same underlying riemann surface with different markings.

(The mapping class group is defined2 as the group of all self-diffeomorphisms of a genus-surface—remember that all such surfaces are topolog-$g$ ically the same—modulo those diffeomorphisms that act trivially on the fundamental group.)

(See the paper by Mumford and Suominen (1972) for a detailed discussion.)

In particular, the moduli spaces of higher-genus surfaces are not described purely by linear algebra plus data about orientation, as is the case in genus 1. that the fundamental group Part of the blame for this complexity lies with the factΓg ≃ π1(X) (g > 1) is no longer Abelian, and in particular it is no longer equal tothe first homology group H(X, Z). A related problem is that X is no longer a group.
A beautiful solution to this1 problem is given by the construction of the Jacobi an Jac(X), which shares with elliptic curves the properties of being a torus (homeomorphic to(S1()2)g), an Abelian group, and a complex (in fact complex-algebraic) man-ifold. (The Jacobi an of an elliptic curve is the elliptic curve itself.) The Jacobi an captures the “Abelian” or“linear” aspects of the geometry of X.

3.4 Further Directions

In this section we give hints at some interesting questions about, and applications of, moduli spaces. Deformations and degenerations.topics in moduli spaces ask which objects are very near Two of the main to a given one, and what lies very far away. Deforma-tion theory is the calculus of moduli spaces: it describes their infinitesimal structure. In other words, given an object, deformation theory is concerned with describ-ing all its small perturbations (see Mazur (2004) for a beautiful discussion of this). At the other extreme, wecan ask what happens when our objects degenerate?
Most moduli spaces, for example the moduli of curves, are not compact, so there are families “going off toinfinity.” It is important to find “meaningful” compactificatio ns of moduli spaces, which classify the possi-ble degenerations of our objects. Another advantage of

compactifying moduli spaces is that we can then calcu-late integrals over the completed space. This is crucial for the next item. Invariants from moduli spaces.cation of moduli spaces in geometry and topology is An important a pp li inspired by quantum field theory, where a particle, rather than following the “best” classical path between two points, follows all paths with varying probabilities(see mirror symmetry [IV.16 §2.2.4](/part-04/mirror-symmetry)).
Classically, one calculates many topological invariants by picking a geo-metric structure (such as a metric) on a space, calculating some quantity using this structure, and finally prov-ing that the result of the calculation did not depend on the structure we chose. The new alternative is to lookat all such geometric structures, and integrate some quantity over the space of all choices. The result, ifwe can show convergence, will manifestly not depend on any choices.
String theory has given rise to many important applications of this idea, in particular by giving a rich structure to the collection of integrals obtained in this way. Donaldson and Seiberg–witten theories use this philosophy to give topological invariants of four-manifolds. Gromov–Witten theory applies it to the topology of symplectic manifolds [III.88](/part-03/symplectic-manifolds), and to counting problems in algebraic geometry, suchas, How many rational plane curves of degree 5 pass through fourteen points in general position?

Modular forms.mathematics, the Langlands program, relates number One of the most profound ideas in theory to function theory (harmonic analysis) on very special moduli spaces, generalizing the moduli space of elliptic curves.

1 Introduction

It is a fundamental theme in mathematics that many objects, both mathematical and physical, have symmetries. The goal oferal, and representation theory in particular, is to study group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) theory in gen these symmetries. The difference between representa-tion theory and general group theory is that in representation theory one restricts one’s attention to symmetries ofto explain why this is sensible and how it influences our vector spaces [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).
I will attempt here study of groups, causing us to focus on groups with certain nice structures involving conjugacy classes. 2 Why Vector Spaces? The aim of representation theory is to understand how the externally internal as a collection of symmetries. In the other structure of a group controls the way it acts direction, it also studies what one can learn about a group’s internal structure by regarding it as a group of symmetries.

what we mean by “acts as a collection of symmetries.”The idea we are trying to capture is that if we are given We begin our discussion by making more precise a group each element G and an obje ctg of G some symmetry of X, then we can associate with X, which we callφ(g)of symmetries to work properly: that is,. For this to be sensible, we need the compositionφ(g)φ(h) (the result of applyingφ(h) and then φ(g)) should be the same symmetry asof X is a particular kind ofφ(gh). if permutation X is a set, then a symmetry[III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) of its elements.
Let us denote by Aut mu tat i ons of X. Then an action(X)of Gthe group ofon Xis defined toall perbe a homomorphism from G to Aut(X). If we are given such a homomorphism, then we say that The image to have in mind is that$G$“does things” to G acts on X.Xand vividly by for getting about. This idea can often be expressed more convenientlyφin the notation: thus, instead of writingφ(g)(x)for the effect onx of the symmetry associated withas a permutation and write ggx, we simply think of. However, some times weg itself do need to talk about wish to compare two different actions ofφas well:
for instance, we might G on X. Here is an example. Take as our object X a square in the plane, centered at the origin, and let its vertices be A, B, C, and D (see figure 1). A square has eight symmetries: four rotations by multiples of 90◦and four reflections. Letmetries; this group is often called G be the group consisting of these eight sym-D , or the dihedral group But it also acts on the set ofof order 8. By definition, vertices G acts on the square.8 of the square: for instance, the action of the reflection through they-axis is to switch A with B and C with D.
It might seem as though we have done very little here. After all, we defined much effort to associate a symmetry with each element G as a group of symmetries so it does not take oftations of the set$G$. However, we did not define$\\{A}$, B, C, D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, so we have at least done G as a group of permu- something.
sets on which we can build sufficiently naturally from the square. To make this point clearer, let us look at some other G acts, which will include any set that For instance,$\\{A}$, B, C, D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, but on the set of edges G acts not only on the set of vertices{AB, BC, CD, DA} and on the set of cross-diagonals\\\\\\\\\\\\. . \1, BD\\\\\\\\\\\\\} as well. Notice in the latter case that some of the elements of Gact in the same way: for example, a clockwise rotation through 90 does a counter clockwise rotation through 90◦ interchanges the two diagonals, as◦.
If all the elements offaithful. Gact differently, then the action is called IV. Branches of Mathematics A B D C Figure 1 A square and its diagonals. through thecan be applied to the whole Cartesian plane Notice that the operations on the square (“reflec ty - axis,” “rotate through 90◦,” and so on)R2. Therefore, acts. To call R2 is another (and much larger) set on which R2 a set, though, is to forget the very$G$interesting fact that the elements in R2 can be added together and multiplied by real numbers: in other words, R2 is a vector space. Further more, the action ofture.
For instance, if G is well-behaved with respect to this extra struc - g is one of our symmetries and v1 andsumvv2 are two elements of + v yields the sum g(v R2, then) + g(vg applied to the). Because of this, we say that When V1 is a vector space, we denote by GL2 G acts linearly on the vector spac(e1)2 (V ) the set R2. of invertible linear maps from tor space Rn, this group is the familiar group GLV to V. If V is the vec-(R) of invertible when V = Cnnit is the group of invertible matrices with. imes  nmatrices with real entries; similarly,$n$ complex entries.
Definition.space V is a homomorphism from A representation of a group G to GLG(V )on a vector. a group as a collection of permutations, while a repre-sentation is the special case where these permutations In other words, a group action is a way of regarding are invertible linear maps. One some times sees repre-sentations referred to, for emphasis, as linear representations.
In the representation ofdescribed above, the homomorphism from D8 on GRto GL2 that we(R) took the symmetry “clockwise rotation through 90 the matrix(0 1 )and the symmetry “reflection through$\circ^{2}$” to the Given one representation of$y$-axis” to the matrix-1 0 (-0 11 0 )G. , we can produce oth- ers using natural constructions from linear algebra.
For example, ifρ is the representation of G on R2 described above, then its morphism from determinant G to R* (the group of nonzero real[III.15](/part-03/determinants) det ρ is a homo- numbers under multiplication), since . et (ρ(gh)) = . et (ρ(g)ρ(h)) = . et (ρ(g)). et (ρ(h)),

by the multiplicative property of determinants. This makes detρ a one-dimensional representation, since each nonzero real number element “multiply byt” of GLt can be thought of as the(R). If ρ is the re pre sen- tation ofthat rotations act as the identity and reflections act as D8 just discussed, then under det1 ρwe find multiplication by-1. The definition of “representation” is formally very similar to the definition of “action,” and indeed, since every linear automorphism of V is a permutation on the set of vectors inform a subset of the actions of V , the representations of G on V .
But the set of G on V representations is in general a much more interesting object. We see here an instance of a general principle: if a set comes equipped with some extra structure (asa vector space comes with the ability to add elements together), then it is a mistake not to make use of that structure; and the more structure the better. In order to emphasize this point, and to place representations in a very favorable light, let us start by considering the general story of actions of groups on sets. Suppose, then, that X.
For each x, the set of all elements of the form G is a group that acts on a setgx, asgto show that the orbits form a partition of ranges over G, is called the orbit of x. It is not hard X. Example.the set X of Let ordered pairs G be the dihedral group of vertices of the square, of D8 acting on which there are sixteen. Then there are three orbits of G on X, namely \. . \1, BB, CC, DD\\}, {AB}, BA, BC, CB, CD, DC, DA, AD, and \. . \1, CA, BD, DB\\. one orbit.
In other words, it is transitive if for everyx An action ofand y in XGyou can find an element on X is called transitive if there is justg such thatgx = y. When an action is not transitive, we can con- sider the action of effectively breaks up the action into a collection of G on each orbit separately, which transitive actions on disjoint sets. So in order to study all actions of Gon sets it suffices to study transitive actions; you can think of actions as “molecules” and transitive actions as the “atoms” into which they can be decomposed.
We shall see that this idea of decomposing into objects that cannot be further decomposed is fundamental to representation theory. source of such actions comes from subgroups Given a subgroup What are the possible transitive actions? A rich H of G, a left coset of H is a set of H of G. the form{gh}: h \in H, which is commonly denoted byg Hleft cosets form a partition of. An elementary result in group theory is that the G (as do the right cosets, 421 if you prefer them). There is an obvious action ofthe set of left cosets of H, which we denote by G/HG: ifon gcoset^  is an element of(g^ g)H.
G, then it sends the coset g H to the Given a transitive action ofx It turns out that every transitive action is of this form!\in  X and let H be the subgroup of G on a set XG, choose some consisting of all elements stabilizer ofxh.) Then one can check that the action ofsuch thatx hx = x.

Ifset X in a nontransitive way, then we can break G acts on our original X up into a union of orbits, each of which, as a result of this correspondence, is associated with a conjugacy class ofsubgroups. This gives us a convenient “bookkeeping” mechanism for describing the action ofkeep track of how many times each conjugacy class of G on X: just subgroups arises.

The subgroups correspond to the divisors ofthe cyclic groups behave quite differently asn, a subtle property of n that makesn varies. Ififnn is prime, then there are very few subgroups, while is a power of 2 there are quite a few. So number theory is involved even if all we want to do is under-stand the subgroup structure of a group as simple as a cyclic group. With some relief we now turn our attention back to linear representations. We will see that, just as with actions on sets, one can decompose representations into “atomic” ones.
But, by contrast with the case ofsets, these atomic representations (called “irreducible” representations, or some times simply “irreducibles”)turn out to exhibit quite beautiful regularities. The nice properties of representation theory come largely from the following fact. While elements of the symmetric group Sn can be multiplied together, ele- ments of GLas multiplied. (But beware: the sum of two elements of(V ), being matrices, can be added as well$GL$(V ) is not necessarily an element of GL(V ), because it may not be invertible.

The irreducible representations are the basic build-ω ing blocks of arbitrary complex representations, justas the basic building blocks for actions on sets are the transitive actions.
It raises the question of what the irre-duc i ble representations are, a question that has been answered for many important examples, but which is not yet solvable by any general procedure. To return to the difference between actions and representations, another important observation is that any action of a group Gon a finite set X can be linearized in the following sense. Iflook at the X [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis)has n elements, then we can L2(X) of all complex- valued functions defined on given by the “delta functions”hilbert space Xδ.

Now we can turn the action G on the basis in an obvious way: we just define definition by linearity, since an arbitrary functiongδx to be δgx. We can extend thisf is a linear combination of the basis functionsus an action of G on L2(X), which can be defined by aδx.

By contrast, a general representation assigns permutation an Now, even when arbitrary invertible matrix. X itself is a single orbit under the action of G, the above representation on L^2(X) can break up into pieces. For an extreme example of this phenomenon, consider the action of Z/n Z on itself by multiplication.

The representation we have just discussed is called the left regular representation of G. The fact that every irreducible representation occurs in it so regularly makes it extremely useful.

The basic theorem of the subject is that this array is a square. Theorem (the character table is square).a finite group.

The fact that it is a basis implies in particular that there are exactly as many irreducible representations as there are conjugacy classes in classes of representations to G, and the map from isomorphism K that sends each ρ to its character is an injection. That is, an arbitrary rep-resentation is determined up to isomorphism by its$G$ character. The internal structure of a group G that controls how it can act on vector spaces is the structure of conju-gacy classes of elements of G.
This is a much gentler structure than the set of all conjugacy classes of groups of G. For example, in the symmetric groups ub-S two permutations belong to the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same cycle type. Therefore,$n$ in that group there is a bijection between conjugacy classes and partitions of$n$.5 count subgroups, conjugacy classes are much easier to handle.

character values are. We know tions there are, but not what they are, or even what how many represent a their dimensions are. We do not have a general method for constructing them, a kind of “non-Abelian fourier transform.” This is the central problem of representation theory. Let us see how this problem can be solved for the group$D^{8}$. Over the course of this article, we have already encountered three irreducible representations of this group. The first is the “trivial” one-dimensional representation: the homomorphism takes every element of D to the identity.
The second isρ:$D^{8} \to GL^{1} that$ the two-dimensional representation we wrote down inthe first section, where each element of8 D acts on R2 in the obvious way.

3 Fourier Analysis We have justified the study of group actions on vector spaces by explaining that the theory of representations has a nice structure that is not present in the theory of group actions on sets. A more historically based account would start by saying that spaces of functions very often come with natural actions of some group G, and many problems of traditional interest can be related to the decomposition of these representations of G.Gthis case many of the nice features of the representa-In this section we will concentrate on the case where is a compact lie group[III.48

The prototypical example is the space L2(S1) of square-integrable functions on the circle$S^{1}$. We can think of the circle as the unit circle in C, and there by identify it with the group of rotations of the circle(since multiplication by eiθ rotates the circle by θ). This action linearizes to an action on$L^{2}(S^{1})$: if$f$ is a square- integrable function defined on circle, then(w · f )(z)is defined to be S1 and wf (wbelongs to the-1 z). That is, w · f does to wz what f does to z. space tions:

(2)) and X = S1 as well, we saw that these irreducible repre- sentations were one dimensional. Now let us look atthe action of the compact group SO$(3) on S^{2}$.
It can be shown that the action of$G on L^{2}(S^{2}) \text{commutes with}$ the Laplacian, the differential operator. elta on L2(S2) defined byΔ = ∂x∂2 2 + ∂y∂2 2 + ∂z∂2 2.

However, other featuresρ are more generic:

Hypergeometric equations, Bessel equations, and many integrable systems arise in this way. the representation theory of compact groups and thatof finite groups. Given a compact group There is more to say about the similarities between G and an irreducible representation its trace (since it is finite dimensional) and therebyρ of G, we can again take define its characteron each conjugacy class.

What happens when we take such a group but relax the requirement that it be compact?A paradigmatic noncompact group is the real numbers R. Like$S^{1}$, R acts on itself in an obvious way (the real number$s \to s + t)$, so let us linearize that action in the usual wayt is associated with the translation and look for a decomposition of$L^{2}(R) into R - invariant$ subspaces.

These functions are not square integrable, bu(tλ). ambda despite this difficulty classical Fourier analysis tells usthat we can write an L2-function in terms of them. However, since the Fourier modes now vary in a con-tinuous family, we can no longer decompose a function as a sum: rather we must use an integral.

The Langlands dual was originally defined in a combinatorial manner, but there is now a conceptual definition. A few examples of pairs(SL , PGL(G,)$.^{L}G) are (GL^{n}$, GLn), (S(O2()n)+1, S(p2)n), and resentation theory as built out of the structure ofthe arithmetic of In this way the Langlands program describes the rep-$n^{n} k$.

For instance, one has to modify the Galois group Although this description indicates the flavor of16 in such a way that the correspondence is true for the group GL$(k) = k^{*}$. When k = R, we get the representation theory ofanalysis; on the other hand, when1 R* (or its compact form S1 k), which is Fourier is a p-adic local field, the representation theory of$k^{*} \text{is described by}$ local class field theory. We already see an extraordinary aspect of the Langlands program:
it precisely unifies and generalizes harmonic analysis and number theory. The most compelling versions of the Langlands program are “equivalences of derived categories” between the category of representations and certain geomet-ric objects on the spaces of Langlands parameters. These conjectural statements are the hoped-for fourier transforms. Though much progress has been made, a large part of the Langlands program remains to be proved. For finite reductive groups, slightly weaker statements have been proved, mostly by Lusztig.
As all but twenty-six of the finite simple groups arise from reductive groups, and as the sporadic groups have had their character tables computed individually, this work already determines the character tables of all the finite simple groups. For groups over R, the work of Harish-Chandra and later authors again confirms the conjectures. But for other fields, only fragmentary theorems have been proved. There is much still to be done.

Groups and geometry are ubiquitous in mathematics, groups because the symmetries (or automorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions)) of any mathematical object in any context form a group and geometry because it allows one to think intuitively about abstract problems and to organize families of objects into spaces from which one may gain some global insight. to the study of infinite, discrete groups.
I shall discuss The purpose of this article is to introduce the reader both the combinatorial approach to the subject that held sway for much of the twentieth century and the more geometric perspective that has led to an enormous flowering of the subject in the last twenty years. Ihope to convince the reader that the study of groups is a concern for all of mathematics rather than something that belongs particularly to the domain of algebra.
interaction of geometry/topology and group theory, The principal focus of geometric group theory is the through group actions and through suitable transla-tions of geometric concepts into group theory. One wants to develop and exploit this interaction for the benefit of both geometry/topology and group theory. And, in keeping with our assertion that groups are important through out mathematics, one hopes to illu-minate and solve problems from elsewhere in mathematics by encoding them as problems in group theory.
Geometric group theory acquired a distinct identity in the late 1980 s but many of its principal ideas have their roots in the end of the nineteenth century. At that time, low-dimensional topology and combinatorial group theory ing, combinatorial group theory is the study of groups emerged entwined. Roughly speak defined in terms of generators and relations. In order to follow the rest of presentations, that is, by means of this introduction the reader must first understand what these terms mean.
Since their definitions would require 432 an unacceptably long break in the flow of our discus - sion, I will postpone them to the next section, but I strongly advise the reader who is unfamiliar with the meaning of the expressionΓ = a, . . . , a | r , . . . , r to pause and read that section before continuing with this one. 1(n1)m The rough definition of combinatorial group theory just given misses the point that, like many parts of mathematics, it is a subject defined more by its core problems and its origins than by its fundamental defi - ni tions.
The initial impetus for the subject came from the description of discrete groups of hyperbolic isome-tries and, most particularly, the discovery of the fundamental group poincaré [VI.61](/part - 06/jules - henri - poincar - 18541912) in 1895. The group-theoretic issues[IV.6 §2](/part - 04/algebraic - topology) of a manifold [I.3 §6.9](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) by that emerged were brought into sharp focus by the work of Tietze and Dehn in the first decade of the twentieth century and drove much of combinatorial group theory for the remainder of the century. topology:
other areas of mathematics threw up funda-Not all of the epoch-defining problems came from mental questions as well. Here are some of the forms they took: Does there exist a group of the following type? Which groups have the following property? What are the subgroups of ...? Is the following group infinite? When can one determine the structure of a group from its finite quotients? In the sections that follow I shall attempt to illustrate the mathematical culture associ-ated with questions of this kind, but let me immediately mention some easily stated but difficult classical problems.
(i) Let Gbe a group that is finitely generated and suppose that there is some positive integer such thatxn = 1 for every x in G. Must Gbe finite? n(ii) Is there a finitely presented group tive homomorphismφ:Γ \to Γ such thatΓ and a surjec-φ(γ) = 1 for someγ . eq1? (iii) Does there exist a finitely presented, infinite, group isomorphic to a subgroup of a finitely generated simple group [I.3 §3.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions)? (iv) Is every countable group, or even a finitely presented group?
in 1902 and the second by Hopf in connection with The first of these questions was asked by Burnside his study of degree - 1 maps between manifolds. I shall present the answers to all four questions (in section 5) to illustrate an important aspect of both combinatorial and geometric group theory: one develops techniques that allow the construction ofscribed properties. Such constructions are of particular explicit groups with pre interest when they illustrate the diversity of possible phenomena in other branches of mathematics. IV.
Branches of Mathematics Another kind of question that raises basic issues in combinatorial group theory takes the form: Does there exist an algorithm to determine whether or not a group (or given elements of a group) has such - and-such a property? For example, does there exist an algorithm that can take any finite presentation and decide in a finite number of steps whether or not the group presented is trivial?
Questions of this type led to a profound and mutually beneficial interaction between group theory and logic, given full voice by the Hig-man embedding theorem, which we shall discuss in section 6. More over, via the conduit of combinatorial group theory, logic has influenced topology as well: one uses group-theoretic constructions to show, for example, that there is no algorithm to determine which pairs of compact triangulated manifolds are homeo-morphic in dimensions 4 and above.
This shows that certain kinds of classification results that have been obtained in two and three dimensions do not have higher-dimensional analogues. theory as the attempt to develop algebraic techniques One might reasonably regard combinatorial group to solve the types of questions described above, and inthe course of doing so to identify classes of groups that are worthy of particular study. This last point, the ques-tion of which groups deserve our attention, is tackled head-on in the final section of this article.
are intrinsically combinatorial in nature, but many Some of the triumphs of combinatorial group theory more have had their true nature revealed by the intro-duction of geometric techniques in the past twenty years. A fine example of this is the way in which Gro - mov’s insights have connected algorithmic problems in group theory to so-called filling problems in Rie-mannian geometry. More over, the power of geometric group theory is by no means confined to improv-ing the techniques of combinatorial group theory: it naturally leads one to think about many other issues of fundamental importance.
For example, it provides a context in which one can illuminate and vastly extend classical rigidity theorems [V.23](/part - 05/mostows - strong - rigidity - theorem), such as that of Mostow. The key to applications such as this is the idea that finitely generated groups can usefully be regarded as geometric objects in their own right. This idea has its origins in the work of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) (1878) and Dehn (1905) but its full force was recog-nized and promoted by Gromov, starting in the 1980 s. It is the key idea that underpins the later sections ofthis article.

The aim of the rest of this section is to say in more detail what this means. we can deduce others:
for example, bearing in mind thatβ2 To begin with, notice that from the facts we are given= γ2 = (βγ)3 = 1, we can show that(γβ)3 = (γβ)3(βγ)3 = 1

as well (where the last equality follows after repeat-edly canceling pairs of the formββ or γγ). We wish to convey the idea that in between the generators except those that follow fromΓΔ there are no relationships the facts above by this kind of argument. Now let us try to say this more formally. We define a set of generators for a groupΓ to be a subset S ⊂ Γ such that every element ofelements of S and their inverses. That is, every elementΓ is equal to some product of can be written in the formis an element of S and each(s1)εε1 (sε)2 is 1 or2 · · · (sε)n-n, where each1. We then callsii

433

we certainly did not mean this at the end of the last paragraph: a relation is not the identity element ofΓ but rather a string of symbols such asa(b-1 a)-1 bc that yields the identity inas generators in the setΓ when you interpret S. In order to be clear abouta, b, and c this, it is useful to define another group, known as the free group F(S). with three generators, taking our set A typical element is a “word” in the elements of For concreteness we shall describe the free group$S \text{to be} \\{a}$, b, c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. \1.
and their inverses, such as the expressiona(b-1 a)-1 bc considered in the previous paragraph. However, wesometimes regard two words as the same: for instance, abcc-1 ac and abab-1 bc are the same because they become identical when we cancel out the inverse pairs$cc^{-1} and b^{-1b}$. More formally, we define two such words to befree group are the equivalent equivalence classes and say that the elements of the[I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar). To multiply words together, we just concatenate them:
for instance, the product ofab-1 and bcca is ab-1 bcca, which we can shorten to“empty word.” This is the free group on three genera-acca. The identity is the torsa, b, and c. It should be clear how to generalize it to an arbitrary setthe set S = \\{a, b, c S, though we shall continue to discuss\\}. onproperty A more abstract way of characterizing the free groupa, b, and: ifc Gis to say that it has the followingis any group and φ is any function from universal S = \\{a, b, c\\} to G, then there is a unique homomor- phismandc toΦ φ(c)from.

So the unique-ness is obvious. The rough reason that this definition really does give rise to a well-defined homomorphism is that the only equations that are true in F(S) are ones that are true in all groups: in order forΦ not to be a homomorphism, one would need a relation to hold in F(S) that did not hold in G, but this is impossible.
to prove that it is (isomorphic to) the “freest” group with generators Now let us return to our exampleα, β, and γthat satisfies the relationsΓΔ. We would likeα2 = β2 = γ2 = (αβ)6 = (αγ)6 = (βγ)3 = 1. But what exactly is this “freest” group that we are claimingis isomorphic to$Γ^{\Delta}$? γare trying to construct that will turn out to be iso-To avoid confusion about the meaning of(are they elements of ΓΔ or of the group that weα, β, and morphic to$Γ^{\Delta}$?) we shall use the letters a, b, and c

when we answer this question. Thus, we are trying to build the “freest” group with generatorsa, b, and c that satisfies the relations(ac)6 = (bc)3 = 1, which we denote bya2 = b2 = c G2 == (ab)a, b, c6 =|a2, b2$, c2$, (ab)6$, (ac)6$, (bc)3. to imitate the above discussion of the free group itself, except that now we say that two words are equivalent There are two ways of going about this task. One is if you can get from one to the other by inserting ordeleting not just inverse pairs but also one of the words $a^{2}$, b2$, c2$, (ab)6$, (ac)6$, or (bc)3.
For example, ab2 c is equivalent tothe set of equivalence classes of words with the product ac in this group. Gis then defined to be coming from concatenation. A neater way to obtain G is more conceptual and ex- ploits the universal property of the free group. Asis to be generated bya, b, and c, the universal prop-G erty of the free group F(S) tells us that there will have to be a unique homomorphism such thatΦ(a) = a, Φ(b) = b, andΦΦ(c)from = F(S)c. More - to G over, we require that all ofand(bc)3 must map to the identity element ina2, b2$, c2$, (ab)6, (ac)G.

Then there is a sur- jective homomorphism from the F(S)/ R to any group that is generated byquotient a[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), b, andc(ac)and satisfies the relations6= (bc)3 = 1.

This gives us a very flexible way of constructing a wide variety of groups.
We might, for example, use a group presentation to encode a question from elsewhere in mathematics.
 We could then ask about the properties of the group thus defined, and see what they had to tell us about our original problem. 3 Why Study Finitely Presented Groups? Groups arise through out the whole of mathematics as groups of automorphisms. These are maps from an object to itself that preserve all of the defining structure: two examples are the invertible ear maps [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from a vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) tolinitself, and the homeomorphisms from aspace [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) to itself.
Groups encapsulate the essence topological of symmetry and for this reason demand our attention. We are driven to understand their general nature, identify groups that deserve particular attention, and develop techniques for constructing new groups (from old ones, or from new ideas). And, reversing the process of abstraction, when given a group, we want to find concrete instances of it. For example, we might like to realize it as the group of automorphisms of some interesting object, with the aim of illuminating the nature of both the object and the group.
(See the article onthis theme.)representation theory [IV.9](/part - 04/\text{representation} - theory) for more on 3.1 Why Present Groups in Terms of Generators and Relations? The short answer is that this is the form in which groups often “appear in nature.” This is particularly true in topology. Before looking at a general result that illustrates this point, let us examine a simple example. Consider the group D of all isometries of R that are generated by the reflections at the points 0, 1, and 2:

To this end, we choose an open interval U with the property that the images of cover the whole of the real line, say U under the maps in U = (-1,3).

You may like to prove that D. α^0, α^1 | α^2^0, α^2^1^0 is a we now state.
(The proof of it is some what involved.) Let This is in fact a special case of a general result, which $X$[IV.6 §1](/part-04/algebraic-topology) andbe a topological space that is both simply connected [III.93](/part-03/universal-covers), and let path connectedΓ be a group of homeomorphisms from choice of path-connected open subset X to itself.

The packaging of infinite objects into finite amounts of data arises through out mathematics in the various guises ofis basically a compactness condition:
a group can be compactness [III.9](/part - 03/compactness - and-\text{compactication}). Finite presentation finitely presented if and only if it is the fundamental group of a reasonable compact space, as we shall see later. Another good reason for studying finitely presented groups is that the Higman embedding theorem (to bediscussed later) allows us to encode questions about arbitrary about such groups and their subgroups.turing machines [IV.20 §1.1](/part-04/computational-complexity) as questions 4 The Fundamental Decision Problems In exploring the geometry and topology of low-dimen-sional
manifolds at the beginning of the twentieth century, Max Dehn saw that many of the problems thathe was wrestling with could be “reduced” to questions about finitely presented groups. For example, he gavea simple formula for associating with a knot diagram [III.44](/part-03/knot-polynomials) a finite presentation of a group. There was one relation for each crossing in the diagram and he argued that the resulting group would be isomorphic to Z if and only if the knot was the unknot: that is, if and onlyif it could be continuously deformed into a circle.
It is extremely hard to tell by staring at a knot diagram whether it is actually the unknot, so this seems like a useful reduction until one realizes that it can be just as hard to tell whether a finitely presented group is iso-morphic to Z. For example, here is the presentation of Z that Dehn’s recipe associates with one of smallest possible pictures of the unknot, namely a diagram with just four crossings:

$a1$, a2, a3, a4, a5 |(a - 1)1 a3(a - 4)1$, a2(a - 3)1a1$, a3(a - 4)1(a - 2)1$, a4(a - 5)1a4(a - 3)1$. Thus Dehn’s investigations led him to understand how difficult it is to extract information from a group presentation. In particular, he was the first to identify the fundamental role of the word problem, which we

436

alluded to earlier, and he was one of the first to begin to understand that there are fundamental problems associated with the challenge of developing algorithms that extract knowledge from well-defined objects such as group presentations. In his famous article of 1912 Dehn writes: The general discontinuous group is given byators andmrelations between them. ... Here there aren gener- above all three fundamental problemsis very difficult and which will not be possible with out whose solution a penetrating study of the subject.

A method Any two is sought for deciding the question whether T can be transformed into each other, i.e., whether S and there is an element relation U of the group satisfying the S = UT U-1.

3. The isomorphism problem: is to decide whether they are isomorphic or not (and Given two groups, one further, whether a given correspondence between the generators of one group and elements of the other is an isomorphism or not). for three lines of enquiry.
First, we shall work toward an out line of the proof that all of these problems are, in We shall take these problems as the starting point a strict sense, unsolvable for general finitely presented groups. The second use that we shall make of Dehn’s problems is to hold them up as fundamental measures of complexity for each of the classes of groups that we subsequently encounter.
If we can prove, for example, that the isomorphism problem is solvable in one class of groups but not in another, then we will have given genuine substance to previously vague assertions to the effect that the second class is “harder.”Finally, I want to make the point that geometry lies at the heart of the fundamental issues in combinatorial group theory: it may not be immediately obvious, but its implicit presence is nonetheless a fundamental trait of group theory and not something imposed for reasons of taste.
To illustrate this point I shall explain how the study of the large-scale geometry of least-area disks in riemannian manifolds [I.3 §6.10](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) is intimately connected with the study of the complexity ofword problems in arbitrary finitely presented groups.

Thus, givenduce a sym bolt ∉ A (usually called theΓ = As table letter| R , we intro-), we choose for each and  ̃$b = ψ(b) in bΓ$, and we define$\in B^{1}$ words ˆb, ̃$b \in F(A)$ with ˆb = b(Γ*)ψ = A, t | R, tbtˆ$- {}^{1}b$ ̃$- {}^{1} (b \in B^{1})$.

I have chosen to focus on amalgamated free products and HNN extensions partly There are many ways of combining groups that I because they lead to transparent solutions of the basic problems discussed below but more because of their primitive appeal and the way in which they arise naturally in the calculation of fundamental groups. They also mark the beginning of arboreal group theory, which we will discuss later.
If space allowed, I would goon to describe semidirect and wreath products, which are also indispensable tools of the group theorist. Before turning to some applications of HNN extensions and amalgamated free products, I want to return to the Burnside problem, which asks if there exist finitely generated infinite groups all of whose ele-ments have a given finite order. This question generated important developments through out the twenti-eth century, particularly in Russia.
It is appropriate to mention it here because it provides another illustration of the fact that it can be useful to study a universal object in order to solve a general question.

Given an exponentby considering them free Burnside group, one clarifies the problem at hand Bn, m given by the presentation of allmth powers in the free groupa1, . . . , an | Rm$, where F(a1$, . . . , a Rm cons is tsn). It is clear that generators in which every element has order dividing$B^{n}$, m maps onto any group with at most nm group with all elements of the same finite order if and. Therefore, there exists a finitely generated infinite only if, for suitable values ofn and m, the group B is infinite.

5.4 An Answer to Hopf’s Question

A group G is called Hopfian if every surjective homomorphism from familiar groups have this property: for example, finite G to G is an isomorphism. Most groups obviously do, as do Zn (as you can prove using linear algebra) and free groups. So too do groups ofmatrices such as SL(Z), as we shall discuss in a moment. A simple example of a non-Hopfian group isthe group consisting of all infinite sequences of inte-$n$ gers (under pointwise addition), since the function that takes(a , a , a , . . . ) to (a , a , a , . . .

5.5 A Group That Has No Faithful

Linear Representation

One can show that a finitely generated group G of matrices over any field isthat for each nontrivial element residually finiteg \in G , which means there exists a finite group Q and a homomorphism π: G \to  Q withπ(g)g \in  SL≠(Z1. For example, if you are given an element), then you can pick an integer m bigger than the absolute values of all the entries inn . imes  nn matrix) and consider the homomorphism fromg (which is an SLmodn(Zm). The image ofto SLn(Z/m Z)gthat reduces the matrix entries in the finite group SL(Z/m Z)n

is clearly nontrivial.

Non-Hopfian groups are not residually finite, and hence are not isomorphic to a group of matrices over any field. One can see that the non-Hopfian group Bdefined above is not residually finite by considering what happens to the nontrivial ele men tc. We saw that there was a surjective homomorphismψ(c) = 1. Let c be an element such thatψ:ψBn \to (c B)with = c (which exists sincen ψ is a surjection). If there weren a homomorphismπ(c) =1, then we would have infinitely many distinctπ from Bto a finite group Q with homomorphisms fromtionsπ ◦ψn;
these are distinct because B to Q, namely the com posi-π . ircψm(c ) = 1$if$ m > n and π . irc ψn(cn) = π(c) = 1. This is a con-n tradiction, since a homomorphism from a finitely gen-erated group to a finite group is determined by what it does to the generators, so there can only be finitely many such homomorphisms.

5.6 Infinite Simple Groups

Britton’s lemma actually tells us more than thatc ≠$1$: the subgroupΛ of B generated by t and c is in fact a free group on those generators. Thus we may form the amalgamated free productΓ of two copies of B, denotedofΛ with the isomorphism B1 and B2, by gluing together the two copiesc \to  t , t \to  c . We have 1 2 1 2

seen that in any finite quotient ofmentsc (= t ) and c (= t ) must have trivial image,Γ = B1^*^Λ B2, the ele- and it is easy to deduce from this that in fact the quo-tient must be trivial. Thus1 2 2Γ1 is an infinite group with no finite quotients. It follows that the quotient of maximal proper normal subgroup is also infinite (andΓ by any it is simple by maximality).The simple group that we have constructed is infinite and finitely generated but it is not finitely presentable. Finitely presented infinite simple groups do exist, but they are much harder to construct.
6 Higman’s Theorem and Undecidability We have seen that there are uncountably many (non - isomorphic) finitely generated groups. But as there are only countably many finitely only countably many finitely generated groups can bepresented groups, subgroups of finitely presented groups. Which ones are they?
a beautiful and deep theorem proved by Graham Hig-man in 1961, which says, roughly, that the groups that A complete answer to this question is provided by arise are all those that are algorithmically describable.(If you have no idea what this means, even roughly, then you might like to read halting problem [V.20](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - halting - problem) before continuing with this the insolubility of the section.)A set Sof words over a finite alphabet A is called recursively enumerable more formally, Turing machine) that can produce aif there is some algorithm (or complete

The elements of Salgorithm that produces an exhaustive list ofneed not be listed in a sensible order, so having an S does not mean that one can use the algorithm to determine that some given wordw does not belong to S:
if you imagine standing by your computer as it enumerates S, there will not in general come a time when you can say to your self, “If it was going to appear, then it would have done so by now,” and therefore be certain that it is not inproperty, then you need the stronger notion of a S. If you want an algorithm with this furtherrecur- sive set, which is a set S such that S and its complement arethe elements that belong toboth recursively enumerable. Then you can list all S and you can also list all the elements that do not belong to A finitely generated group is said to be S.
recursively presentable if it has a presentation with a finite number 440 of generators and a recursively enumerable set of defin-ing relations. In other words, such a group is not necessarily finitely presented, but at least the presentation of the group is “nice” in the sense that it can be generatedby some algorithm. generated group if it is isomorphic to a subgroup of a finitely presented Higman’s embedding theorem states that G is recursively presentable if and onlya finitely group.
consider the following presentation of the group of all rationals under addition, in which the generator To get a feeling for how nonobvious this is, you might ancorresponds to the fraction 1$/n!:$ Q = a1$, a2$, · · · | (an)n = an-1 ∀n ⩾ 2. Higman’s theorem tells us that Q can be embedded in a finitely presented group, but no truly explicit embedding is known. ease with which it implies the celebrated undecidabil-ity results that were rightly regarded as watersheds The power of Higman’s theorem is illustrated by the of twentieth-century mathematics.
In order to make this case convincingly, I shall give a complete proof(except that I shall assume some of the facts mentioned earlier) that there exist finitely presented groups with unsolvable word problems, and also that there are sequences of finitely presented groups among which one cannot decide isomorphism. We shall also see how these group-theoretic results can be used to translate undecidability phenomena into topology. The basic seed of undecidability comes from the fact that there are recursively enumerable subsets S ⊂ N that are not recursive.
Using this fact one can readily construct finitely generated groups with an unsolv-able word problem: given such a set of integers S we consider $J = a$, b, t | t(bnab-n)t-1 = bnab-n ∀n \in S . This is the HNN extension of the free group associated with the identity map L \to  L, where LF(a, b)is the subgroup generated by${bnab^{-}n}$:$n \in S$.
Britton’s lemma tells us that the word $wm = t(bmab^{-}m)t^{-}1(bma^{-}1b^{-}m) equals 1$\in  J if and only if m \in  S, and by definition there is no algorithm to decide ifm \in S, so we cannot decide which of the unsolvable word problem.wm are relations. Thus J has an That there exist finitely presented groups for which the word problem is unsolvable is a much deeper fact, but with Higman’s embedding theorem at hand the

proof becomes almost trivial: Higman tells us that Jcan be embedded in a finitely presented groupΓ , and it is a relatively straightforward exercise to show that if one cannot decide which words in the generators ofnot decide for arbitrary words in the generators of J represent the identity, then one can-Γ either. Once one has a finitely presented group with an unsolvable word problem, it is easy to translate unde-cid ability into all manner of other problems. For example, suppose thatΓ = A | Ris a finitely presented group with an unsolvable word problem, where\\{a , . . .

In particular, it contains a copy ofΓ , and hence has an unsolvable word problem, whichw means that it cannot be a free group. Thus, since there is no algorithm to decide whether$w = 1 in Γ$, one can- not decide which of the groups which others.$Γ^{w} \text{are isomorphic to}$ algorithm to determine whether or not a given finitely A variant of this argument shows that there is no presented group is trivial.
We shall see in a moment that every finitely presented grouppact four-dimensional manifold. By following a stan-G is the fundamental group of some com- dard proof of this theorem with considerable care, Markov proved in 1958 that in dimensions 4 and above there is no algorithm to decide which compact mani-folds (presented as simplicial complexes, for example) are homeomorphic.
His basic idea was to show that if there were an algorithm to determine which triangulated 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, then one could use it to determine which finitely presented groups are trivial, which we know is impossible. In order to implement this idea one has to be careful to arrange that the4-manifolds associated with different presentations of the trivial group are homeomorphic: this is the delicate part of the argument. which compact three-dimensional manifolds are iso-Strikingly, there does exist an algorithm to decide morphic.
This is an extremely deep theorem that relies in particular on Perelman’s solution to thurston’s geometrization conjecture [IV.7 §2.4](/part-04/dierential-topology).

Imagine gluing the boundary of the square to the graph so as to respect the labeling of edges: with a bit of thought, you should be able to see that the result is a torus, that is, a surface in the shape of a bagel. An observation that turns out to be important is that the fundamental group of the torus is Z2, the group we started with. attaching maps boundary of the square The idea of “gluing” is made precise by the use of:
we take a continuous map S to the graph K1φthat sends from the the corners of the square to the vertex of K1 and sends each side (minus its vertices) homeomorphic ally ontoan open edge. The torus is then the quotient of$K^{1} \\\% S$ by the equivalence relation that identifies eachx in the boundary of the square with its imageφ(x). see how the above construction generalizes to arbitrary presentations: given a presentation With this more abstract language in hand, it is easy to$P$ ≡ a $, . . . , a |r^{1}$, . . .

For example, we would like to construct a lower-dimensional manifold with fundamental groupΓ , enabling us to exploit our physical insight into three- dimensional geometry. But it turns out that the fun-da mental groups of compact three-dimensional manifolds are very special;
this observation lies near the heart of a great deal of mathematics at the end ofthe twentieth century. Other interesting fields open up

442

when one asks which groups arise as the fund a men-tal groups of compact spaces satisfying curvature [III.13](/part-03/curvature) conditions, or constraints coming from complex geometry. A particularly rich set of constraints comes from the following question. Can one arrange for an arbitrary finitely presented group to be the fundamental group of a compact space (a complex or manifold, perhaps) whose universal cover isis a natural question from the point of view of topology contractible [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology)?
This because a space with a contractible universal cover is, up to homotopy [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology), completely determined by its fundamental group. If the fundamental group isΓ , then such a space is called aits homotopy-invariant properties provide a rich array classifying space forΓ and of invariants for the group gross dependence that K(P ) Γhas on(getting away from the P rather than Γ ). If our earlier discussion of how hard it is to recognize Γdependence can actually be removed, then your skep-from P has left you very skeptical about whether this ticism is well-founded:
there are many obstructions tothe construction of compact classifying spaces for an arbitrary finitely presented group; the study of them (under the generic name are a at the interface of modern group theory, topology, finiteness conditions) is a rich and homological algebra. One aspect of this area is the search for natural conditions that ensure the existence of compact classifying spaces (not necessarily manifolds). This is oneof several places where manifestations of nonpositive curvature play a fundamental role in modern group theory. More combinatorial conditions also arise.
For example, Lyndon proved that for any presentation A | rwhere the single defining relationr \in  F(A)P ≡is not a nontrivial power, the universal cover of contractible. K(P ) is cerns questions of uniqueness and rigidity for classi-A neighboring and highly active area of research conf ying spaces.
(Here, as is common, the wordis used to describe a situation in which requiring two rigidity objects to be equivalent in an apparently weak sense forces them to be equivalent in an apparently stronger sense.) For example, the (open) Borel conjecture asserts that if two compact manifolds have isomorphic funda-mental groups and contractible universal covers, then those manifolds must be homeomorphic. I have been talking mostly about realizing groups as fundamental groups, which led to certain free actions.
That is, we could interpret the elements of the group as symmetries of a topological space and none of these

IV. Branches of Mathematics

symmetries had any fixed points. Before moving on togeometric group theory I should point out that there are many situations in which the most illuminating actions of a group are not free: one instead allows wellunderstood stabilizers. (Theset of all symmetries in the group that leave that point stabilizer of a point is the fixed.) For example, the natural way in which to studyΓΔ is by its action on the triangulated plane, each vertex of which is left unmoved by twelve symmetries. A deeper illustration of the merits of seeking insight into algebraic structure through nonfree actions onsuitable
topological spaces comes from the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees, which subsumes the theory of amalgamated free products and HNN exten-sions, whose potency we saw earlier. (This theory and its extensions often go under the heading of group theory.) arboreal A tree is a connected graph that has no circuits in it. It is helpful to regard it as awhich each edge has length 1. The group actions that metric space [III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces) in one allows on trees are those that take edges to edges isometrically, never flipping an edge.
If a groupΓ acts on a set X (in other words, if it can be regarded as a group of symmetries of orbit of a pointx \in  X is the set of all its images X), then thegx with gf ree product\in  Γ . A group A^*Γ can be expressed as an amalgamated B if and only if it acts on a tree in such a way that there are two orbits of vertices, one orbit of Cedges, and stabilizers stabilizers of adjacent vertices and intersect in A, B, C (where A and BCare the, which is the edge stabilizer). HNN extensions correspond to actions with one orbit of vertices and one orbit of edges.
Thus, amalgamated free products and HNN extensions appear asof Bass–Serre theory. These objects allow one to recover graphs of groups, which are the basic objects groups acting on trees from the quotient data of the action, i.e., the quotient space (which is a graph) and the pattern of edge and vertex stabilizers. and instructive proof that any finite subgroup ofis conjugate to a subgroup of either An early benefit of Bass–Serre theory is a transparent A or B: given any set(A*)C BVpointof vertices in a tree, there is a unique vertex or mid-x minimizing max\\{d(x, v) | v \in  V \\};
one applies this observation withxprovides a fixed point for the action of the subgroup; Van orbit of the finite subgroup; and any point stabilizer is conjugate to a subgroup of either A or B. Arboreal group theory goes much deeper than this first application suggests. It is the basis for a decompo-sition theory of finitely presented groups from which

IV.10. Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory it emerges, for example, that there is an essentially canonical maximal splitting of an arbitrary finitely presented group as a graph of groups with cyclic edge stabilizers. This provides a striking parallel with the decomposition theory of 3-manifolds, a parallel that extends far beyond a mere analogy and accounts for much of the deepest work in geometric group theory in the past ten years. If you want to learn more about this, search the literature formay also want to search for complexes of groups JSJ decompositions, which.
You provide the appropriate higher-dimensional analogue for graphs of groups. 8 Geometric Group Theory Let us refresh the image ofby thinking again about the presentation K(P )in our mind’s eye P ≡ a, b |aba-1 b-1 of Z. The complex K(P ), as we saw earlier, is a torus. Now the torus can be defined as the quotientof the Euclidean plane R2 by the action of the group Z2 (where the point(m, n) \in  Z^2 acts as the translation(x, y) \to  (x + m, y + n)): in fact, R2, with an appropriate square tiling, is the universal cover of the torus.
Ifwe look at the orbit of the point 0 under this action, it forms a copy of large-scale geometry of Z2, and one can there by see the Z2 laid out for us. We can make the idea of the “geometry of Z2” precise by decreeing that edges of the tiling have length 1 and defining the graph distance between vertices to be the length of the shortest path of edges connecting them. As this example shows, the construction of K(P ) involves the two main (intertwined) strands of geomet-ric group theory.
In the first and more classical strand, one studies actions of groups on metric and topologi-cal spaces in order to elucidate the structures of both the space and the group (as with the action of Z2 on the plane in our example, or the action of the fundamental group of K(P ) on its universal cover in general). The quality of the insights that one obtains varies accord-ing to whether the action has or does not have certain desirable properties. The action of Z2 on R2 consists of isometries on a space with a fine geometric structure, and the quotient (the torus) is compact.
Such actions are in many ways ideal, but some times one accepts weaker admission criteria in order to obtain a more diverse class of groups, and some times one demands even more structure in order to narrow the focus and study groups and spaces of an exceptional, but for that reason interesting, character. with the second.

finitely generated groups as geometric objects in their own right equipped with word metrics, which are defined as follows. Given a finite generating set S for a group each elementΓ, one defines theγ \in  Γ by an edge to each element of the Cayley graph of Γ by joining formγs or γs-1 with s \in  S (which is the same as the graph formed by the edges of the universal coveringof K(P )). The distance d (γ , γ ) between γ and γ is then the length of the shortest path from edges have length 1. Equivalently, it is the length of the(S1)2 γ1 1 to γ2 if all2 shortest word in the free group onγ-1γ in Γ .
S that is equal to 1 The word metric and the Cayley graph depend on the2 choice of generating set but their large-scale geometry does not. In order to make this idea precise, we introduce the notion of alence relation that identifies spaces that are similar on quasi-isometry. This is an equivaa large scale. If quasi-isometry from X and XYtoare two metric spaces, then a Y is a function φ: X \to Ywith the following two properties. First, there are pos-itive constantsc, C, and such that cd(x, x^ ) - ⩽d(φ(x), φ(x^ )) ⩽ Cd(x, x^ ) +:
this says thatφ dis- torts sufficiently large distances by at most a constant factor. Second, there is a constant C^  such that for everyy \in  Y there is some x \in  X for which d(φ(x), y) ⩽ C^: this says that every element ofφis a “quasi-surjection” in the sense that Y is close to the image of an element of Consider for example the two spaces$X$. R2 and Z2, where the metric on defined earlier. In this case the map Z2 is given by the graph distanceφ$: R2$\to  Z^2 that takes(x, y) to ( x!, y !) (where  x!
denotes the largest integer less than or equal tox) is easily seen to be a quasi-isometry:
if the Euclidean distance two points(x, y) and (x^ , y^ ) is at least 10, say, thend between the graph distance between will certainly lie between 1$(d xand 2!$, y !d). Notice how lit - and ( x^ !, y^ !) tle we care about the local structure of the two spaces:2 the map continuous.φ is a quasi-isometry despite not even being from X It is not hard to check that ifthat “quasi-inverts”X to Y , then there is a quasi-isometryφ, in the sense that everyφ is a quasi-isometryψ fromx Yin to X is at most a bounded distance fromin Y is at most a bounded distance fromψφ(x)φψ(y)and every.
Oncey one has established this, it is easy to see that quasi-isometry is an equivalence relation. Returning to Cayley graphs and word metrics, it turns out that if you take two different sets of generators forthe same group, then the resulting Cayley graphs will be

quasi-isometric. Thus, any property of a Cayley graph that is invariant under quasi-isometry will be a property not just of the graph but of the group itself. When dealing with such invariants we are free to think ofas a space (since we do not care which Cayley graph weΓ itself form), and we can replace it by any metric space thatis quasi-isometric to it, such as the universal cover of a closed Riemannian manifold with fundamental groupΓ (whose existence we discussed earlier). Then the tools of analysis can be brought to bear on it.
many people and often called the provides a crucial link between the two main strands A fundamental fact, discovered independently by Milnor–Švarc lemma, of geometric group theory. Let us call a metric space X a length space if the distance between each pair of points is the infimum of the lengths of paths joining them.
The Milnor–Švarc lemma states that if a groupΓ acts “properly discontinuously” as a set of isometries of a length spaceΓis finitely generated and quasi-isometric to X, and if the quotient is compact, then X (for any choice of word metric).We have seen an example of this already: Z2 is quasiisometric to the Euclidean plane. Less obviously, the same is true ofelementα of Γ Γto the point of^Δ. (Consider the map that takes each Z2 nearest α(0).) manifold is quasi-isometric to the universal cover of The fundamental group of a compact RiemannianΔ that manifold.
Therefore, from the point of view of quasi-isometry invariants, the study of such manifolds is equivalent to the study of arbitrary finitely presented groups. In a moment we will discuss some nontrivial consequences of this equivalence. But first let us reflect on the fact that, when finitely generated groups are considered as metric objects in the framework of large-scale geometry, they present us with a new challenge: we should quasi-isometry.

Given any group G and any subgroup H of G, the commutator [G, H] is the subgroup generated by all elements of the form$ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$, where g belongs to G and h belongs to H.

Thus the seemingly rigid and purely algebraic condition of having a nilpotent subgroup of finite index is in fact a quasi-isometry invariant, and therefore a flabby, robust characteristic of the group. orems have been established for many other classes of groups, including lattices in semisimple Lie groups In the past fifteen years quasi-isometric rigidity theand the fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds(where the classification up to quasi-isometry involves more than algebraic equivalences), as well as various classes defined in terms of their graph of group decompositions.

IV.10. Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory must identify nontrivial invariants of quasi-isometry that allow one to distinguish and relate various classes of spaces. In many cases such invariants come from the development of suitable analogues of the tools of algebraic topology, modified so that they behave well with respect to quasi-isometries rather than continuous maps. 9 The Geometry of the Word Problem It is time to explain the comments I made earlier about the geometry inherent in the basic decision problems of combinatorial group theory.
I shall concentrate exclusively on the geometry of the word problem. mate connection between the highly geometric study Gromov’s filling theorem describes a startlingly intiof disks with minimal area in[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and the study of word problems, which riemannian geometry seems to belong more to algebra and logic. On the geometric side, the basic object of study is the isoperimetric function nian manifold M . Given any contractible closed path of Fill M (l) of a complete Rieman- length by that path.

Thus, the isoperi- true to say that every closed path of len gthl can be filled by a disk of area at most Fill M (l). if one twists a circular wire of length The image to have in mind here is that of a soap film:
l in Euclidean space and dips it in soap, the film that forms has area atmostl2/4π, where as if one performs the same experi- ment in hyperbolic space [I.3 §6.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), the area of the film is bounded by a linear function ofthe isoperimetric functions of En land. Correspondingly, Hn (and quo- tients of them by groups of isometries) are quadratic and linear, respectively. In a moment we shall discuss what types of isoperimetric functions arise when one considers other geometries (more precisely, compact Riemannian manifolds).
To state the filling theorem we need to think about the algebraic side as well. Here, we identify a function that measures the complexity of a direct attack on the word problem for an arbitrary finitely presented groupΓ = A | R . If we wish to know whether a word w equals the identity in insight into the nature ofΓ and do not have any furtherΓ , then there is not much we can do other than repeatedly insert or remove the given relations r\in R. 445 In this group prove this? Well, Consider the simple exampleaba2 b represents the identity.
How do weΓ = a, b | b2 a, baba .aba2 b = a(b2 a)ba2 b = ab(baba)ab = abab = a(baba)a - 1 = aa - 1 = 1. Now let us think about the proof geometrically, via the Cayley graph. Sinceaba2 b = 1 in the group Γ , we obtain a cycle in this graph if we start at the identity and go along edges labeled a, b, a, a, b, in that order (in which case we visit the vertices 1, aba2 b = 1). The equalities in the proof can be thought a, ab, aba, aba2, of as a way of “contracting” this cycle down to the iden-tity by means of inserting or deleting small loops:
for instance, we could insert directions, since baba is a relation, or we could deleteb, a, b, a into the list of edge a trivial loop of the form$a$, a-1. This contraction can be given a more topological character if we turn our Cayley graph into a two-dimensional complex by filling in each small loop with a face. Then the contraction of the original cycle consists in gradually moving it across these small faces.
equals the identity is intimately connected with the Thus, the difficulty of demonstrating that a word$w$ area algebraically as the smallest sequence of relations youofw, denoted Area(w), which can be thought of need to insert and delete to turn geometrically as the smallest number of faces you needw into the identity, or to make a disk that fills the cycle represented by The Dehn functionδ: N \to N bounds Area(w)w. inΓ terms of the length|w| of the word w:δ (n) is theΓ largest area of any word of length at most1 inΓ .
If the Dehn function grows rapidly, then then that equals word problem is hard, since there are short words that are equal to the identity, but their area is very large, so that any demonstration that they are equal to the identity has to be very long. Results bounding the Dehn function are called isoperimetric inequalities. different finite presentations of the same group willin general yield different Dehn functions. This ambi-The subscript onδΓ is some what misleading since guity is tolerated because it is tightly controlled:
if the groups defined by two finite presentations are isomorphic, or just quasi - isometric, then the corresponding Dehn functions have similar growth rates. More precisely, they are times called the equivalent standard equivalence relation, with respect to what is some-“≃” of geometric group theory: given two monotone functionsf$, g:[0$, . nfty ) \to [0, . nfty ), one writes f g if there exists a constant C > 0 such that f (l) ⩽ Cg(Cl + C)+Cl + C for 446 all this relation to include functions from l ⩾ 0, and f ≃ g if f g and g f; and one extends N to[0,. nfty ).

9.1 What Are the Dehn Functions?

We have seen that the complexity of word problems is related to the study of isoperimetric problems in Riemannian and combinatorial geometry. Such insights have, in the last fifteen years, led to great advances inthe understanding of the nature of Dehn functions. For example, one can ask for which number st io nn^ρ is a Dehn function. The set of all such numbers,ρ the func- which can be shown to be countable, is known as the isoperimetric spectrum, denoted IP, and it is now largely understood.

The true nature of the class of groups with a quadratic Dehn function remains obscure for the moment but there is a beautifully definitive description of those with a linear Dehn function: they are thein the next section.word hyperbolic groups, which we shall discuss Not all Dehn functions are of the form nα: there are Dehn functions such as nα

will grow faster than any recursive function (indeed this serves as a definition of such groups). 9.2 The Word Problem and Geodesics Athat locally minimizes distance, such as a loop formed closed geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is a loop by an elastic band when released on a perfectly smooth surface. Examples such as the great circles on a sphere or the waist of an hourglass show that manifolds may contain closed geodesics that areis, they can be moved continuously until they are null - homotopic: that reduced to a point.
But can one construct a compact topological manifold with the property that no matter what metric one puts on it there will always be infinitely many such geodesics? (Technically, if you go around a geodesic loopntimes, then you get a geodesic; we avoid this by counting only “primitive” geodesics.) ing problem: all specific metric information has been stripped away and one has to deal with an arbitrary From a purely geometric point of view this is a dauntmetric on the floppy topological object left behind. But group theory provides a solution:
if the Dehn function of the fundamental group22 n , then in any Riemannian metric onπ1 M grows at least as fast as M there will be infinitely many closed geodesics that are null-homotopic The proof of this is too technical to sketch here. . 10 Which Groups Should One Study? Several special classes of groups have emerged from our previous discussion, such as nilpotent groups, 3-manifold groups, groups with linear Dehn functions, and groups with a single defining relation.
Now we shall change viewpoint and ask which groups present themselves for study as we set out to explore the universe ofall finitely presented groups, starting with the easiest ones. the finite groups. Finite groups are discussed in vari-ous other places in this volume, so I shall ignore them The trivial group comes first, of course, followed by in what follows and adopt the approach of large-scale geometry, blurring the distinction between groups that have a common subgroup of finite index. The first infinite group is surely Z, but what comes next is open to debate.
If one wants to retain the IV.10. Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory safety of commutativity, then finitely generated Abe-lian groups come next. Then, as one slowly relinquishes commutativity and control over growth and construct i bility, one passes through the progressively larger classes of nilpotent, polycyclic, solvable, and elementary amenable groups. We have already met nil-potent groups in our discussion of Gromov’s polynomial-growth theorem.
They crop up in many contexts as the most natural generalization of Abelian groups and much is known about them, not least because one can prove a great deal by induction on thearek-step nilpotent. One can also exploit the fact thatk for which they Gis built from the finitely generated Abelian groups Gpolycyclic groups is built in a similar way, while finitely i/(Gi)+1 in a very controlled way. The larger class of generated solvable groups are built in a finite number of steps from Abelian groups that need not be finitely generated. This last class is not only larger but wilder;
the isomorphism problem is solvable among polycyclic groups, for example, but unsolvable among solvable groups. By definition a group series, defined inductively by GGis solvable if its(n) = [G((n - 1))$, Gderived((n - 1))] with$(G(()0){)} = G, terminates in a finite number of steps. tant link between geometry, analysis, and group theory. Solvable groups are amenable but not vice versa.
It is The concept known as amenability forms an impor not quite the case that a finitely presented group isamenable if and only if it does not contain a free subgroup of rank 2, but for a novice this serves as a good rule of thumb. Now, let us return to Z in a more adventurous frame of mind, throw away the security of commutativity, and start taking free products instead. In this more liberated approach, finitely generated free groups appear after Z as the first groups in the universe. What comes next?
Thinking geometrically, we might note that free groups are precisely those groups that have a tree as a Cayley graph and then ask which groups have Cayley graphs that are A key property of a tree is that all of its triangles are tree - like. degenerate: if you take any three points in the tree and join them by shortest paths, then every point in one of these paths is contained in at least one other path as well. This is a manifestation of the fact that trees are spaces of infinite negative curvature.
To get a feeling for why, consider what happens when one rescales the metric on a space of bounded negative curvature such as the hyperbolic plane H2. If we replace the standard distance function letn tend to . nfty , then the curvature of this space (ind(x, y) by (1/n)d(x, y) and 447 the classical sense of differential geometry) tends to−. nfty. This is captured by the fact that triangles look increasingly degenerate: there is a constantδ(n) \to 0 as n →. nfty, such that any side of a triangle inδ(n), with the scaled hyperbolic space$(H^{2}$, (1/n)d) is contained in the sides.
More colloquially, triangles inδ(n)-neighborhood of the union of the other two H2 are uniformly thin and get increasingly thin as one rescales the metric. away from trees by asking which groups have cayley graphs in which all triangles are uniformly thin. (It With this picture in mind, one might move a little makes little sense to specify the thinness constantδ since it will change when one changes generating set.)The answer is Gromov’s hyperbolic groups. This is a fascinating class of groups that has many equivalent definitions and arises in many contexts.
For example, we have already met it as the class of groups that have linear Dehn functions. (It is not at all obvious that these two definitions are equivalent.)Gromov’s great insight is that because the thin-triangles condition encapsulates so much of the essence of the large-scale geometry of negatively curved manifolds, hyperbolic groups share many of the rich proper-ties enjoyed by the groups that act nicely by isometries on such spaces.
Thus, for example, hyperbolic groups have only finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups, contain no copy of Z2, and (after accounting for torsion) have compact classifying spaces. Their conjugacy problems can be solved in less than quadratic time, and Sela showed that one can even solve the isomorphism problem among torsion-free hyperbolic groups.
In addition to their many fascinating properties and natural definition, a further source of interest in hyperbolic groups is the fact that in a precise sta-tistical sense, a random finitely presented group will be hyperbolic. Spaces of negative and nonpositive curvature have played a central role in many branches of mathematics in the last twenty years. There is no room even to begin to justify this assertion here but it does guide us in where to look for natural enlargements of the class of hyperbolic groups:
we want nonpositively curved groups, defined by requiring that their Cayley graphs enjoy a key geometric feature that cocompact groups of isometries inherit from simply connected spaces of nonpositive curvature (“CATtrast to the hyperbolic case, the class of groups that one(0)spaces”). But in con obtains varies considerably when one perturbs the definition, and delineating the resulting classes and their(rich) properties has been the subject of much research.

Remarkably, this vague question has a convinc-immediate neighbors of free ing answer. One of the great triumphs of arboreal group theory is the proof that there is a finite description of the set Hom finitely generated group(G, F) of homomorphisms from an arbitrary G to a free group F . The basic building blocks in this description are what Sela calls limit groups. One of the many ways of defining a limit group Lis that for each finite subset X ⊂ L there should exist a homomorphism to a finitely generated free group that is injective on X . first-order logic group in a precise sense.
To see how first-order logic Limit groups can also be defined as those whose[IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory) resembles that of a free can be used to say something nontrivial about a group, consider the sentence

∀x, y, z(xy ≠ yx) ∨ (yz ≠ zy) ∨ (xz = zx) ∨ (y = 1). A group with this property isx commutes with y ≠ 1, and commutative transitivey commutes with z, then: if xhave this property but a direct product of non-abelian commutes with z. Free groups and Abelian groups free groups, for example, does not. It is a simple exercise to show that free Abelian groups are limit groups. But if one restricts attentionto groups that have precisely the same first-order logic as free groups, one gets a smaller class consisting onlyof hyperbolic groups.
The groups in this class are the subject of intense scrutiny at the moment. They all have negatively curved two-dimensional classifying spaces, built from graphs and hyperbolic surfaces in a hierar-chical manner. The fundamental groupsΣ of closed surfaces of genus stance to the traditional opinion in combinatorial groupg ⩾ 2 lie in this class, lending sub-g theory that, among nonfree groups, it is the groups that resemble free groups Fn most closely.

their outer automorphism groups GLMod Out(Σ ) (the mapping class group)$. These^{n}(Z)$, Out(Fn), and three classes of groups play a fundamental role across a broad spectrum of mathematics. I have mentioned$g^{g}$ them here in order to make the point that, beyond the search for knowledge about natural classes of groups, there are certain “gems” in group theory that merit adeep and penetrating study in their own right.
Other groups that people might suggest for this category include Coxeter groups (generalized reflection groups, for whichlarly braid groupsΓΔ is a prototype) and Artin groups (particu-[III.4](/part-03/braid-groups), which again crop up in many branches of mathematics).I have thrown classes of groups at you thick and fast in this last section. Even so, there are many fas-cin at ing classes of groups and important issues that I have ignored completely.
But so it must be, for as Higman’s theorem assures us, the challenges, joys, and frustrations of finitely presented groups can never be exhausted.

Much of analysis tends to revolve around the study of general classes of[III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties). The functions are often real-valued or complex-functions [I.2 §2.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar) and operators valued, but may take values in other sets, such as a vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or a manifold [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). An operator is itself a function, but at a “second level,”because its domain and range are themselves spaces of functions:
that is, an operator takes a function (or per-haps more than one function) as its input and returns a transformed function as its output. Harmonic analysis

answer is to focus on its deduced from them: even if the solution of a differ en-properties and see what can be tial equation cannot be described by a useful formula, one may well be able to establish certain basic facts about it and be able to derive interesting consequences from those facts. Some examples of properties that one might look at are measurability, boundedness, continuity, differentiabili ty, smoothness, analyticity, integra-bility, or quick decay at infinity. One is thus led to consider interesting general classes of functions:
to form such a class one chooses a property and takes the setof all functions with that property. Generally speaking, analysis is much more concerned with these general classes of functions than with individual functions. (See also This approach can in fact be useful even when one function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces).) is analyzing a single function that is very structured and has an explicit formula.
It is not always easy, oreven possible, to exploit this structure and formula in a purely algebraic manner, and then one must rely (at least in part) on more analytical tools instead. A typical example is the Airy function. nfty Ai$(x) =−$. nfty(ei)(xξ+ ξ 3 ) dξ. Although this is defined explicitly as a certain integral, if one wants to answer such basic questions as whether Aiintegral goes to zero as(x) is always a convergent integral, and whether thisx → ±. nfty, it is easiest to proceed using the tools of harmonic analysis.

Similarly, above can be quantified by a variety of norms [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces), 450 which assign a nonnegative number (or+. nfty) to any given function and which provide some quantitative measure of one characteristic of that function.
be sides being of importance in pure harmonic analysis, quantitative estimates involving these norms are also useful in applied mathematics, for instance in performing an error analysis of some numerical algorithm. Functions tend to have infinitely many degrees of freedom, and it is thus unsurprising that the number of norms one can place on a function is infinite as well: there are many ways of quantifying how “large” a func-tion is. These norms can often differ quite dramatically from each other.
For instance, if a function large for just a few values, so that its graph has tall, f is very thin “spikes,” then it will have a very large L . nfty - norm, but|f (x)| dx, its L1-norm, may well be quite small. Conversely, ifthen it is possible forf has a very broad and spread-out graph,|f (x)| dx to be very large even if large|f (x)L1|-norm but a small is small for every L. nfty x-norm. Similar examples: such a function has a can be constructed to show that the times behaves very differently from either the L2 - norm some - L1 - normor the L. nfty -norm.
However, it turns out that the L2-norm lies “between” these two norms, in the sense that if one controls both the L1-norm and the L. nfty -norm, then one also automatically controls thereason is that if the L. nfty -norm is not too large then one L2-norm. Intuitively, the eliminates all the spiky functions, and if the L1 - norm is small then one eliminates most of the broad functions; the remaining functions end up being well-behaved in the intermediate L2-norm.
More quantitatively, we have the inequality(f L)2 ⩽ (f1()L()/){1}2 (f1()L)/ . nfty2, which follows easily from the trivial algebraic fact thatif|f (x)| ⩽ M, then |f (x)|2 ⩽ M |f (x)|. This inequality is a special case ofis one of the fundamental inequalities in harmonichölder’s inequality [V.19](/part - 05/inequalities), which analysis.
The idea that control of two “extreme” norms automatically implies further control on “intermediate” norms can be generalized tremendously and leads to very powerful and convenient methods known as interpolation The study of a single function and all its norms, which is another basic tool in this area. eventually gets some what tiresome, though. Nearly all fields of mathematics become a lot more interesting when one considers not just objects, but also between objects.
In our case, the objects in question maps are functions, and, as was mentioned in the intro duc - tion, a map that takes functions to functions is usually IV. Branches of Mathematics referred to as an called a transform operator[III.91](/part - 03/transforms).) Operators may seem like. (In some contexts it is also fairly complicated mathematical objects—their inputs and outputs are functions, which in turn have inputs and outputs that are usually numbers—but they are infact a very natural concept since there are many situations where one wants to transform functions.
For example, differentiation can be thought of as an operator, which takes a function This operator has a well-known (partial) inverse, f to its derivative df /inte-dx. gration, which takesf to the function Fthat is defined by the formula

$F(x) = {}^{−}\infty^{x} f (y)dy$.

A less intuitive, but particularly important, example is the fourier transform [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform). This takesf to a function ˆf , given by the formula. nftyf (x)ˆ=−. nfty (e-2()π){i}xy f (y)dy.

It is also of interest to consider operators that take two or more inputs. Two particularly common examples are theg are two functions, then their pointwise product pointwise product and convolution. If f andf g is defined in the obvious way:

$(f g)(x) = f (x)g(x)$.

The convolution, denoted$f^{*} g$, is defined as follows: $f^{*} g(x) = {}^{−}$. nfty$\infty f (y)g(x - y) dy$. This is just a very small sample of interesting opera-tors that one might look at. The original purpose of harmonic analysis was to understand the operators that were connected to Fourier analysis, real analysis, and complex analysis. Nowadays, however, the subject has grown considerably, and the methods of harmonic analysis have been brought to bear on a much broader set of operators.
For example, they have been particularly fruitful in understanding the solutions of vari-ous linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, since the solution of any such equation can be viewed as an operator applied to the initial conditions. They are also very useful in analytic and combinatorial number theory, when one is faced with understanding the oscillation present in various expressions such as exponential sums.
Harmonic analysis has also been applied to analyze operators that arise in geometric measure theory, probability theory, ergodic theory, numerical analysis, and differential geometry. A primary concern of harmonic analysis is to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about

IV.11. Harmonic Analysis

the effects of these operators on generic functions. A typical example of a quantitative estimate is the inequality

f* g L . nfty ⩽ (f L)2 (g L)2,

which is true for all$f$, g \in L2. This result, which is a special case ofjust writes out the definition of Young’s inequality$f$, is easy to prove: one${}^{*} g(x) \text{and applies}$ the cauchy–schwarz inequality [V.19](/part - 05/inequalities). As a consequence, one can draw the qualitative conclusion that the convolution of two functions in$L^{2} \text{is always con}-$ tinuous.
Let us briefly sketch the argument, since it is an instructive one. A fundamental fact about functions in$L^{2} \text{is that any}$ such function(in the$L^{2}$-norm) by a function  ̃f can be approximated arbitrarily wellf that is continuous and compactly supported$f$ ̃ takes the value zero every where out side some inter-. (The second condition means that val$f$ ̃ and  ̃[-M, M]g be approximations of this kind.
It is an exercise.) Given any two functions f and g in L2, let in real analysis to prove that  ̃$f^{*} g$ ̃ is continuous, and it follows easily from the inequality above that  ̃close tof* g in the L. nfty -norm, since f* g ̃ is $f^{*} g - f$ ̃${}^{*} g$ ̃$= f^{*} (g - g) ̃$+ (f - f ) ̃${}^{*} g$. ̃ Therefore, in the L. nfty -norm by continuous functions.

First, one iden-Notice the general structure of this argument, which tifies a “simple” class of functions for which one can easily prove the result one wants. Next, one proves that every function in a much wider class can be approximated in a suitable sense by simple functions. Finally, one uses this information to deduce that the result holds for functions in the wider class as well.
In our case, the simple functions were the continuous func-tions of finite support, the wider class consisted of square-integrable functions, and the suitable sense of approximation was closeness in the$L^{2} - norm$. tive and quantitative analysis of operators in the next We shall give some further examples of qu al it a section. 2 Example: Fourier Summation To illustrate the interplay between quantitative and qualitative results, we shall now sketch some of the

451

basic theory of summation of Fourier series, which his-tori cally was one of the main motivations for studying harmonic analysis. In this section, we shall consider functionsf that are periodicf (x + 2π)with period 2 = f (x) for allπ: that is, functions such thatx. An example of such a func- tion isf (x) = 3 + . in (x) - 2 cos(3 x). A function like this, which can be written as a finite linear combina-tion of functions of the form sin(nx) and cos(nx), is called a trigonometric polynomial.
The word “polynomial” is used here because any such function can beexpressed as a polynomial in sin(x) and cos(x), or alternatively, and some what more conveniently, as apolynomial in eix and (e-i)x. That is, it can be written asficients$N^{n}=−(c^{N} c^{n}e$: inx-Nfor some⩽ n ⩽ NN)and some choice of coef-. If we know that f can be expressed in this form, then we can work out the coefficient ncn quite easily: it is given by the formula

Suppose that also continuous (or, more generally, thatf is a periodic function that isf is absolutely integrable, meaning that the integral of|f (x)| between 0 and 2 ficientsπf (n)ˆ is finite). We can then define theoff , using exactly the formula we had Fourier coef- above for$c^{n}$:

f (n)ˆ= 21(π0()2){π} f (x)(e-i)nx dx.

expressing nomial,” but this is not always true, and even when it is$f$as a sort of “infinite trigonometric poly true it takes some effort to justify it rigorously, or even to say precisely what the infinite sum means. To make the question more precise, let us introduce for each natural number operator$S^{N}$. This takes a function N the Dirichlet summationf to the function SN fthat is defined by the formula

SN f (x) =n=−N N f (n)ˆ einx.

The question we would like to answer is whether converges tof as N → $\infty$. The answer turns out to SN f be surprisingly complicated: not only does it depend

452

on the assumptions that one places on the function but it also depends critically on how one defines “con-f , vergence.” For example, if we assume thatf is con- tinuous and ask for the convergence to be uniform, then the answer is very definitely no: there are examples of continuous functions even converge pointwise toff. However, if we ask forfor which SN f does not a weaker form of convergence, the answer is yes:

If instead it is possible for the partial sums SNf to diverge at every single point Lp topology for everyx, as well as being divergent in thep such that 0 < p ⩽ . nfty .
The proofs of all of these results ultimately rely on very quantitative results in harmonic analysis, and in particular on various Lp -type estimates on the Dirichlet sum SN f (x), as well as estimates connected with the closely related function sup maximal operator|S f (x)|. , which takes f to the discuss a simpler result, in which the Dirichlet summa-tion operators As these results are a little tricky to prove, let us first N>S0 are replaced by the NFejér summation operators age of the first FN. For each NNDirichlet operators:
that is, it is given N, the operator FN is the aver- by the formula

FN = N1 (S0 + · · · + (SN)-1).

It is not hard to show that ifso does FN f . However, by averaging the SN f converges to SN f we allowf , then cancellations to take place that some times make it pos-sible for F f to converge to f even when S f does not. Indeed, here is a sketch of a proof thattof whenever N fis continuous and periodic—which, as(FN)Nf converges we have seen, is far from true of In its basic structure, the argument is similar to the$S^{N} f$. one we used when showing that the convolution oftwo functions in L2 is continuous.

Almost-every where convergence Lp when p <. nfty , so we cannot use the above results to prove it.
It turns out to be a much harder question, and was a famous open problem, eventually answered by carleson’s theorem Carleson proved that one has an estimate of the form[V.5](/part - 05/carlesons - theorem) and an extension of it by Hunt.

These results require a lotof harmonic analysis theory. In particular they use many decompositions of both the spatial variable andthe frequency variable, keeping the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in mind. They then carefully reassemble the pieces, exploiting various manifestations of orthogonality.
To summarize, quantitative estimates such as$Lp$estimates on various operators provide an important route to establishing qualitative results, such as convergence of certain series or sequences. In fact there area number of principles (notably the uniform boundedness principle and a result known asprinciple) which assert that in certain circumstances Stein’s maximal this is the only route, in the sense that a quantitative estimate must exist in order for the qualitative result to be true. 453 3 Some General Themes in Harmonic Analysis:
Decomposition, Oscillation, and Geometry One feature of harmonic analysis methods is that they tend to be local rather than global. For instance, if one is analyzing a function pose it as a sumf = f +· · ·+f it is quite common to decom - f , with each function f “localized” in the sense that its support (the set of val-uesx for which f (x)1 = 0) has a small diameter. Thi(sk)ii would be called localization in the spatial variable. One can also localize in thethe process to the Fourier transform ˆfrequency variablef ofby applyingf .
Having split the pieces separately and then recombine them later.f up like this, one can carry out estimates for One reason for this “divide and conquer” strategy isthat a typical function ftends to have many different features—for example, it may be very “spiky,” “dis-continuous,” or “high frequency” in some places, and “smooth” or “low frequency” in others—and it is diffi-cult to treat all of these features at once. A well-chosen decomposition of the function tures from each other, so that each component has onlyf can isolate these fea- one salient feature that could cause difficulty:
the spiky part can go into onef , the high-frequency part intoi

another, and so on. In reassembling the estimates from the individual components, one can use crude tools such as the triangle inequality or more refined tools, for instance those relying on some sort of orthogonality, or perhaps a clever algorithm that groups the com-pone nts into manageable clusters. The main drawback of the decomposition method (other than an aesthetic one) is that it tends to give bounds that are not quite optimal;
however, in many cases one is content with anestimate that differs from the best possible one by a multiplicative constant. To give a simple example of the method of decomposition, let us consider the Fourier transform ˆfunction$f$: R$\to C$, defined (for suitably nice functionsf (ξ) of af ) by the formul af (ξ)ˆ= R f (x)(e-2()π){i}xξ dx.

First, since the modulus of eequal to 1, it follows that Here are two simple observations in response to this|f (ξ)ˆ| is at mos(t-2()π){i}xξ|f (x)is always|dx. This tells us that particular, ˆf \in  L. nfty . Secondly, the Plancherel theorem, afˆL . nfty ⩽ (f L)1, at least if R f \in  L1. In very basic fact of Fourier analysis, tells us that$f$ˆ$L2 is$

In other words, what happens Lp is not contained in eitherf lies in L1 ordirectly. However, let us take a function$L2$, one cannot use either of the above two resultsf \in  Lp and consider what the difficulty is. The reason lie in L1 is that it may decay too slowly: for instance, f may not the functionf (x) = (1 + |x|)-3/4 tends to zero more slowly than 1/x as x → . nfty, so its integral is infinite.
However, if we raise function(1 + |x|)-9/8 f which decays quickly enough toto the power 3/2 we obtain the have a finite integral, sof does belong to L3/2. Similar examples show that the reason L2 is that it can have places where it tends to infinit yf may fail to belong to slowly enough for the integral ofnot slowly enough for the integral of|f |p|fto be finite but|2 to be finite. ent. Therefore, we can try to decompose Notice that these two reasons are completely differ-f into two pieces, one consisting of the part where the other consisting of the part wheref fis small.

attempt to quantify the elusive phenomenon oftion Another basic theme in harmonic analysis is the. Intuitively, if an expression oscillates wildly, then oscil la we expect its average value to be relatively small in magnitude, since the positive and negative parts, or inthe complex case the parts with a wide range of different arguments, will cancel out. For instance, if a 2 periodic functionf is smooth, then for large n theπ-

will be very small since- {}ππ (e-i)nx = 0 and the com- paratively slow variation instop the cancellation occurring. This assertion can eas-f (x) is not enough to ily be proved rigorously by repeated integration by parts. Generalizations of this phenomenon include the so-called principle of stationary phase, which among other things allows one to obtain precise control onthe Airy function Ai(x) discussed earlier.
It also yields the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the decay and smoothness of a function to the decay and smoothness of its Fourier transform. A some what different manifestation of oscillation lies in the principle that if one has a sequence of func-tions that oscillate in different ways, then their sum should be significantly smaller than the bound that follows from the triangle inequality. Again, this is the result of cancellation that is simply not noticed by the triangle inequality.
For instance, the Plancherel theo-rem in Fourier analysis implies, among other things, that a trigonometric polynomial L2 - norm o(f N)n=−N cn(ei)nx has an 2(πN()2){1}/ 2 N 1 / 2 2(π0)n=−N cn(ei)nx = n=−N |cn|2. This bound (which can also be proved by direct calcu-lation) is smaller than the upper bound of N |c | that would be obtained if we simply applied the trian-gle inequality to the functionsc (ei)nx.
This identity cann=−N n be viewed as a special case of the Pythagorean theo-rem, together with the observation that the harmonics$n$ einx are all orthogonal to each other with respect to the inner product [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis)

$f$, g = 21π0 2 π f (x)g(x) dx.

This concept of orthogonality has been generalized ina number of ways. For instance, there is a more general and robust concept of “almost orthogonality,” which roughly speaking means that the inner products of acollection of functions are small but not necessarily 0.

IV.12 Partial Differential Equations Sergiu Klainerman Introduction Partial differential equations (or PDEs) are an important class ofor systems of equations, in which the unknowns are functional equations: they are equations, functions of more than one variable.
As a very crude analogy, PDEs are to functions as polynomial equations (such asx2 + y2 = 1, for example) are to num - bers. The distinguishing feature of PDEs, as opposed tomore general functional equations, is that they involve not only unknown functions, but also various derivatives of those functions, in algebraic combina-partial tion with each other and with other, fixed, functions.
Other important kinds of functional equations are gral equations, which involve various integrals of the in te unknown functions, and(ODEs), in which the unknown functions depend onordinary differential equations only one independent variable (such as a time variable td) and the equation involves only ordinary derivatives/dt, d2/dt2$, d3/dt3$, . . . of these functions. hope to do is to give a very crude perspective on some Given the immense scope of the subject the best I can of the main issues and an even cruder idea of the mul-titude of current research directions.
The difficulty one faces in trying to describe the subject of PDEs starts with its very definition. Is it a unified area of mathematics, devoted to the study of a clearly defined set of objects (in the way that algebraic geometry studies solutions of polynomial equations or topology studies manifolds, for example), or is it rather a collection ofseparate fields, such as general relativity, several complex variables, or hydrodynamics, each one vast in its own right and centered on a particular, very difficult, equation or class of equations? I will attempt to argue

456

below that, even though there are fundamental diff i cul-ties in formulating a general theory of PDEs, one can nevertheless find a remarkable unity between various branches of mathematics and physics that are centeredon individual PDEs or classes of PDEs. In particular, certain ideas and methods in PDEs have turned out to be extraordinarily effective across the boundaries of these separate fields. It is thus no surprise that the most successful book ever written about PDEs did not mention PDEs in its title:
it was Methods of Mathematical Physics by As it is impossible to do full justice to such a huge courant [VI.83](/part-06/richard-courant-18881972) and hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943). subject in such limited space I have been forced to leave out many topics and relevant details; in particular, I have said very little about the fundamental issue ofbreakdown of solutions, and there is no discussion of the main open problems in PDEs.
A longer and more detailed version of the article, which includes these topics, can be found at http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8350.html 1 Basic Definitions and Examples The simplest example of a PDE is the tion [I.3 §5.4](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) laplace equa$\Delta u = 0$.

Thus, when one is studying the equations one1/c, x2/c, x3/c)satisfies the same equation with1 2 3 can set these constants to be 1. Both equations are called evolution equations because they are supposed to describe the change of a particular physical object as the time parametert varies.

As we shall see later, one of the important developments in the theory of PDEs was the study of more refined notions of solutions, such as distributions [III.18](/part-03/distributions), which require only weak versions of differentiabili ty. Here are some further examples of important PDEs. The first is the schrödinger equation [III.83](/part-03/the-schrdinger-equation), i$\partial u + k\Delta u = 0$, (4)t

whereu is a function from R . imes  R3 to C. This equation describes the quantum evolution of a massive particle,$k = /2m$, where >0 is Planck’s constant andm is the mass of the particle. As with the heat equation, onecan setk to equal 1 after a simple change of variables. Though the equation is formally very similar to the heat equation, it has very different qualitative behavior. this illustrates an important general point about PDEs: that small changes in the form of an equation can lead tovery different properties of solutions. A further example is the Klein–Gordon equation

Though all five equations mentioned above first appeared in connection with specific physical phenom-ena, such as heat transfer for (2) and propagation of electromagnetic waves for (3), they have, miraculously, a range of relevance far
beyond their original applica-tions. In particular there is no reason to restrict their study to three space dimensions: it is very easy to

The characteristic feature of linear constant-coefficient operators is translation invariance.
Roughly speaking, this means that if you translate a function translate Pu in the same way. More precisely, ifu, then youv(x) is defined to bethe value ofvu(xat x-+a)a; note that(so the value ofx anduaatbelong tox becomes R3 here), then Pv(x) is equal to Pu(x - a). As a conse- quence of this basic fact we infer that solutions to the homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient equation (8) are still solutions when translated. 457 PDEs we should stop for a moment to make a general Since symmetries play such a fundamental role in definition. A symmetry of a PDE is any invertible opera - tion T:

A pde invariant under the symmetry T. The symmetry T is often a linear opera - tion, though this does not have to be the case.
The com-position of two symmetries is again a symmetry, as is the inverse of a symmetry, and so it is natural to view acollection of symmetries as forming a group [I.3 §2.1](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) (which is typically a finite- or infinite-dimensional lie group [III.48 §1](/part - 03/lie - theory)).
nected with Because the translation group is intimately con-the fourier transform [III.27](/part - 03/the - fourier - transform) (indeed, the latter can be viewed as the representation theory of the former), this symmetry strongly suggests that Fourier analysis should be a useful tool to solve constant-coefficient PDEs, and this is indeed the case. Laplacian Our basic constant-coefficient linear operators, theΔand the d’Alembertian , are formally similar in many respects.
The Laplacian is fund a men-tally associated with the geometry of euclidean space [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) R3 and the d’Alembertian is similarly associated with the geometry of R1$+3$. This means that the Laplacian commutes with minkowski space[I.3 §6.8](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) all the rigid motions of the Euclidean space R3, while the d’Alembertian commutes with the corresponding class of Poincaré transformations of Minkowski spacetime.
In the former case this simply means that invari-ance applies to all transformations of R3 that preserve the Euclidean distances between points. In the case of the wave equation, the Euclidean distance has tobe replaced by the spacetime distance between points (which would be called ti vi ty): if P = (t, x , x , xeve nts) andin the language of rela-Q(s, y , y , y ), then the distance between them is given by the formula1 2 3 1 2 3

To solve such an equation requires one to understand the invertibility or other-wise of the linear operator P: if it is invertible then$u$ will equal P-1 f , and if it is not invertible then either there will be no solution or there will be infinitely many solutions. In homogeneous equations are closely related to their homogeneous counterpart;

Such an equation models the flow varies from point to point.
The corresponding space of solutions is not translation invariant (which is not surprising as the medium in which the heat flows isnot translation invariant). Equations like this are called linear equations with variable coefficients difficult to solve them and describe their qualitative.
It is more features than it is for constant-coefficient equations.(See, for example, stochastic processes [IV.24 §5.2](/part - 04/stochastic - processes) for an approach to equations of type (2) with variablek.) Finally, nonlinear equations such as (7) can often still be written in the form (8), but the operator P is now a nonlinear differential operator.

Operators such as these mately constructed from algebraic operations and par-tial derivatives, both of which are “local” operations, we observe the important fact that P is at least still a “local” operator. More precisely, if$u1 and u2 are$ two functions that agree on some open set expressions P[u ] and P[u ] also agree on this set. In D, then the 1 2

In reality one is often restricted to a fixed R3, R$+ \times R^{3}$, domain of that space. Thus, for example, equation (1) is usually studied on a bounded open domain of R3 subject to a specified basic examples of boundary conditions.boundary condition.

A basic result in PDEs asserts that if the domain D has a sufficiently smooth boundary, then there is exactly one solution to the problem (10) for any prescribed functionu0 on the boundary ∂D.

Generally speaking, Dirichlet boundary conditions correspond to“absorbing” or “fixed” barriers in physics, where as Neumann boundary conditions correspond to “reflecting”or “free” barriers. Natural boundary conditions can also be imposed for our evolution equations (2)–(4). The simplest one is toprescribe the values ofu when t = 0. We can think of IV.12. Partial Differential Equations this more geometrically. We are prescribing the values ofu at each spacetime point of form (0, x, y, z), and the set of all such points is a hyperplane in R1$+ {}^{3}$:

However, many important PDEs involve either multiple unknown scalar functions or (equivalently) functions that take values in a multi dimensional vector space such as Rm. In such cases, we say that we have aimportant example of a system is that of the system of PDEs. an cauchyriemann equations [I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions):$\partial1 u2 - \partial2 u1 = 0$, . artial1 u1 + . artial2 u2 = 0, (12) where plane.

This is the standard situation for a The system (12) contains two equations and two$\partial1^{\partial}2 deter-$ mined system over determined. Roughly speaking, a system is called if it contains more equations than unknowns and under determined if it contains fewer equations than unknowns. Under determined equations typically have infinitely many solutions for any given set of prescribed data;
conversely, over determined equations tend to have no solutions at all, unless some additional compatibility conditions are imposed on the prescribed data. Observe also that the Cauchy–Riemann operator$P$ has the following remarkable property:

P2[u] = P[P[u]] = . elta 1 eltau(u1)2.

Thus P can be viewed as a square root of the two- dimensional LaplacianΔ. One can define a similar type

In this case the[III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) tensor of spacetime metric itself is the unknown to be solved for. One can often reduce such equations locally to more traditional PDE systems by selecting a suitable choice of coordinates, but the task of selecting a “good” choice of coordinates, and working out how different choices are compatible with each other, is a nontrivial and important one. Indeed, the task of selecting a good set of coordinates in order to solve a PDE can end up being a significant PDE problem in its own right. science.

The more modern relativistic quantum field theories lead, in principle, to equations in an infi-nite number of unknowns, which lie beyond the scope of PDEs. Yet, even in that case, the basic equations preserve the locality property of PDEs.
More over, the start-ing point of a quantum field theory [IV.17 §2.1.4](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras) is always a classical field theory, which is described by

systems of PDEs. This is the case, for example, in the standard model of weak and strong interactions, which is based on the so-called Yang–Mills–Higgs field theory. If we also include the ordinary differential equations of classical mechanics, which can be viewed as one-dimensional PDEs, we see that essentially all of physics is described by differential equations.
As examples of PDEs underlying some of our most basic physical theo-ries we refer to the articles that discuss the euler and navier–stokes equations [III.23](/part-03/the-euler-and-navierstokes-equations), the heat equation the einstein equations[III.36](/part-03/the-heat-equation), the schrödinger equation[IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations). [III.83](/part-03/the-schrdinger-equation), and An important feature of the main PDEs is their apparent universality.
Thus, for example, the wave equation, first introduced by d’alembert [VI.20](/part - 06/jean - le - rond - dalembert - 17171783) to describe the motion of a vibrating string, was later found to be connected with the propagation of sound and electro-magnetic waves. The heat equation, first introduced by fourier in many other situations in which dissipative effects[VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) to describe heat propagation, appears play an important role. The same can be said about the Laplace equation, the Schrödinger equation, and many other basic equations.
It is even more surprising that equations that were originally introduced to describe specific physical phe-nomena have played a fundamental role in several areas of mathematics that are considered to be “pure,” such as complex analysis, differential geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry. Complex analysis, for example, which studies the properties of holomorphic functions, can be regarded as the study of solutions tothe Cauchy–Riemann equations (12) in a domain of R2.
Hodge theory is based on studying the space of solutions to a class of linear systems of PDEs on manifolds that generalize the Cauchy–Riemann equations: it plays a fundamental role in topology and algebraic geometry. the atiyah–singer index theorem lat ed in terms of a special class of linear PDEs on mani-[V.2](/part - 05/the - atiyahsinger - index - theorem) is formufolds, related to the Euclidean version of the Dirac operator. Important geometric problems can be reduced to finding solutions to specific PDEs, typically nonlinear. We have already seen one example:

Another striking example is the uniformization theorem faces, which takes a compact Riemannian surface[V.34](/part - 05/the-\text{uniformization} - theorem) in the theory of sur - S (a two-dimensional surface with a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions)) and, by solving the PDE$\Delta u + (e2)u = K (15)S$ IV.12.
Partial Differential Equations (which is a nonlinear variant of the Laplace equation(1)), uniformizes the metric so that it is “equally curved” at all points on the surface (or, more precisely, has constant scalar curvature [III.78](/part - 03/ricci - flow)) with out changing theing any of the angles subtended by curves on the sur-conformal class of the metric (i.e., with out distort face). This theorem is of fundamental importance tothe theory of such surfaces:
in particular, it allows one to give a topological classification of compact surfacesin terms of a single numberχ(S), which is called the euler characteristic three-dimensional analogue of the uniformization the-[I.4 §2.2](/part-01/general-goals) of the surface S. The orem, the Thurston, has recently been established by Perelman, geometrization conjecture [IV.7 §2.4](/part-04/dierential-topology) of who did so by solving yet another PDE; in this case, the equation is the ricci flow [III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) equation

$\partial g = 2 Ric(g)$, (16)t

which can be transformed into a nonlinear version ofthe heat equation (2) after a carefully chosen change of coordinates. The proof of the geometrization con-jecture is a decisive step toward the total classification of all three-dimensional compact manifolds, in particular establishing the well-known poincaré conjecture details in establishing this conjecture, one needs to[IV.7 §2.4](/part-04/dierential-topology).
To over come the many technical make a detailed qualitative analysis of the behaviorof solutions to the Ricci flow equation, a task which requires just about all the advances made in geometric PDEs in the last hundred years. and geometry but also in many fields of applied sci-ence. In engineering, for example, one often wants to Finally, we note that PDEs arise not only in physics control some feature of the solutio nu to a PDE by care- fully selecting whatever components of the given data one can directly influence;
consider, for instance, how a violinist controls the solution to the vibrating string equation (closely related to (3)) by modulating the force and motion of a bow on that string in order to produce abeautiful sound. The mathematical theory dealing with these types of issues is called control theory. cannot possibly have complete information about the state of the system at any given time. Instead, one When dealing with complex physical systems, one often makes certain randomness assumptions about various factors that influence it.
This leads to the very important class of equations called stochastic differential equations the equation involve a(SDEs), where one or more components of random variable [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) of some sort. An example of this is in the black–scholes

A general dis-stochastic processes [IV.24 §6](/part-04/stochastic-processes).The plan for the rest of this article is as follows. In section 2 I shall describe some of the basic notions and achievements of the general theory of PDEs.
The main point I want to make here is that, in contrast with ordinary differential equations, for which a gen-eral theory is both possible and useful, partial differential equations do not lend themselves to a useful gen-eral theoretical treatment because of some important obstructions that I shall try to describe. One is thus forced to discuss special classes of equations such as elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic, and dispersive equations.
In section 3 I will try to argue that, despite the impossi-bility of developing a useful general theory that encompasses all, or most, of the important examples, there is nevertheless an impressive unifying body of concepts and methods for dealing with various basic equations, and this gives PDEs the feel of a well-defined area of mathematics.
In section 4 I develop this further by try-ing to identify some common features in the derivation of the main equations that are dealt with in the subject. An additional source of unity for PDEs is the central role played by the issues of regularity and breakdown of solutions, which is discussed only briefly here. In the final section we shall discuss some of the main goals that can be identified as driving the subject.
2 General Equations One might expect, after looking at other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry or topology, that there was a very general theory of PDEs that could be specialized to various specific cases. As I shall argue below, this point of view is seriously flawed and very much out of fashion. It does, however, have important merits, which I hope to illustrate in this section. I shall avoid giving formal definitions and focus instead on representative examples. The reader who wants more precise definitions can consult the online version of this article. systems of PDEs.
The simplest distinction, which wehave already made, is between scalar equations, such For simplicity we shall look mostly at determined as (1)–(5), which consist of only one equation and one unknown, and systems of equations, such as (12) and (13). Another simple but important concept is that of the derivative that appears in the equation; this concept is order of a PDE, which is defined to be the highest

For are second order in space, although some (such as (2)or (4)) are only first order in time. Equations (12) and (13), as well as the Maxwell equations, are first order.1 nonlinear equations, with the linear equations being divided further into constant-coefficient and variable-We have seen that PDEs can be divided into linear and coefficient equations. One can also divide nonlinear PDEs into several further classes depending on the “strength” of the nonlinearity.
At one end of the scale, a semilinear equation is one in which all the nonlinear components of the equation have strictly lower order than the linear components. For instance, equation (15)is semilinear, because the nonlinear component eu is of zero order, i.e., it contains no derivatives, whereasthe linear component. elta u is of second order. These S

equations are close enough to being linear that they can often be effectively viewed as perturbations of a linear equation. A more strongly nonlinear class of equationsis that of quasilinear equations, in which the highestorder derivatives ofa linear manner but the coefficients attached to thoseu appear in the equation only in derivatives may depend in some nonlinear manner on lower-order derivatives.
For instance, the second-order equation (7) is quasilinear, because if one uses the product rule to expand the equation, then it takes the quasilinear form F11(. artial1 u, . artial2 u). artial2 1 u + F12(. artial1 u, . artial2 u). artial1. artial2 u + F22(. artial1 u, . artial2 u). artial2 2 u = 0 for some explicit algebraic functions$F11$, F12, F22 of the lower-order derivatives of tions can still some times be analyzed by perturb at i veu. While quasilinear equa - techniques, this is generally more difficult to accom-plish than it is for an analogous semilinear equation.
Finally, we haveno linearity properties whatsoever. A typical example is fully nonlinear equations, which exhibit the Monge–Ampère equation$\det (D2 u) = F(x, u, Du)$,

where$u$: Rn \to  R is the unknown function, Du is the gradient Hessian matrix[I.3 §5.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) ofof$u$, andu, DF2 u:=Rn(. artial 1 imesi. artial Rju). imes1(R⩽()n){i}, j^⩽. on Ris theis a given function.

to the complex geometry of[III.6](/part-03/calabiyau-manifolds). Fully nonlinear equations are among the most calabi–yau manifolds difficult and least well-understood of all PDEs. Remark. Most of the basic equations of physics, such as the Einstein equations, are quasilinear. However, fully nonlinear equations arise in the theory of characteristics of linear PDEs, which we discuss below, and also in geometry.

2.1 First-Order Scalar Equations

It turns out that first-order scalar PDEs in any num-ber of dimensions can be reduced to systems of firstorder ODEs. As a simple illustration of this impor-tant fact consider the following equation in two space dimensions: a1(x1$, x2)\partial1 u(x1$, x2)+a2(x1$, x2)\partial2 u(x1$, x2)= f (x1$, x2)$, (17) wherex = (x(a1)1, x, a2)2,\in f Rare given real functions in the variables2.
We associate with (17) the first - order 2$\times 2 system$ d$x1 (s) = a1(x1(s)$, x2(s))$,\}|||\}$ d$s$(18) dd$xs2 = a2(x1(s)$, x2(s)).⎪⎪⎪⎭ To simplify matters, let us assume that Suppose now that$x(s) = (x^{1}(s)$, x2(s))f =is a solution0.$of (18)$, and let us consider how$u(x^{1}(s)$, x^2(s)) varies ass varies. By the chain rule we know that$dd$ s u = ∂^1 udds ddxs^1 + ∂^2 uddxs^2 , and equations (17) and (18) imply that this equals zero(by our assumption that$f = 0)$.
In other words, any solution$u = u(x^{1}$, x2) of (17) with f = 0 is con- stant along any parametrized curve of the form$(x^{1}(s)$, x2(s))that satisfies (18).$x(s) =$ which are called(17), then we can find all solutions to (17). I say “in prin-Thus, in principle, if we know the solutions to (18), characteristic curves for the equation ciple” because, in general, the nonlinear system (18) isnot so easy to solve.
Nevertheless, ODEs are simpler to deal with, and the fundamental theorem of ODEs, which we will discuss later in this section, allows us to solve (18) at least locally and for a small interval in The fact thatu is constant along characteristic curvess. allows us to obtain important qualitative information even when we cannot find explicit solutions. For exam-ple, suppose that the coefficients a1, a2 are smooth (or IV.12.
Partial Differential Equations real analytic) and that the initial data is smooth (or realanalytic) every where on the set Hwhere it is defined, except at some point the solutio nu remains smooth (or real analytic) atx0 where it is discontinuous. Then all points except along the characteristic curveΓ that starts at(18) that satisfies the initial condition x0, or, in other words, along the solution tox(0) = x . That is, the discontinuity atx0 propagates precisely along0Γtant principle, which we shall explain in more detail. We see here the simplest manifestation of an impor- later:

For any given solution curve(s, x(s)) we haveu(dof (21) and any characteristic/ds)u(s, x(s)) = 0. Thus, in principle, knowing the solutions to (22) should allow usto determine the solutions to (21). However, this argument seems worryingly circular, since in (22).u itself appears sider the IVP for (21): that is, look for solutions that satisfy To see how this difficulty can be circumvented, con- u(0$, x) = u (x)$. Consider an associated char- acteristic curve Then, sinceu is constant along the curve, we must havex(s)0 such that, initially, x(0) = x0.u(s, x(s))that dx/ds==uu0(x(x0)).
Hence, going back to (22), we infer and thus x(s) = x + su (x ). Wethus deduce that0 0 0 0 0 u(s$, x0 + su0(x0)) = u0(x0)$, (23)

which implicitly gives us the form of the solution We see once more, from (23), that if the initial data isu. smooth (or real analytic) every where except at a pointx of the line t = 0, then the corresponding solution is also smooth (or real analytic) every where in a smallneighborhood0 V of x0, except along the characteristic curve that begins atsary here because new singularities can form at large$x0$. The smallness of V is neces- scales. Indeed,$x + su (x)$, whose slopes depend onu has to be constant along the linesu (x).
At a point where these lines cross we would obtain different val-ues of$u^{0}$, which is impossible unless u becomes singular0 by this point smooth, nonconstant initial data. This blow-up phenomenon occurs for anyu . Remark.linear equation (17) and the quasilinear equation (19).There is an important difference between the The characteristics of the first depend only on the coef-ficients$a1(x)$, a2(x), while the characteristics of the second depend explicitly on a particular solution the equation.

Briefly, we can constructa solutio nu to (24) based only on the knowledge of the solutions the bi characteristic curves(x(t), p(t))of the nonlinear PDE$. Onceto (25)$, which are called again, singularities can only propagate along bichar-acteristic curves (or hypersurfaces). As in the case of

464

the Burgers equation, singularities will occur for moreor less any smooth data. Thus, a classical, continuously differentiable solution can only be constructed locally in time. Both Hamilton–Jacobi equations and Hamiltonian systems play a fundamental role in clas-sical mechanics as well as in the theory of the propagation of singularities in linear PDEs. The deep con-nection between Hamiltonian systems and first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations played an important rolein the introduction of the Schrödinger equation into quantum mechanics.

2.2 The Initial Value Problem for ODEs

Before we can continue with our general presentation of PDEs we need first to discuss, for the sake of com-paris on, the IVP for ODEs. Let us start with a first-order

ODE. artial xu(x) = f (x, u(x)) (26) subject to the initial condition$u(x0) = u0$. (27) Let us also assume for simplicity that (26) is a scalar equation and thatu, such as f (x, u)f=is a well-behaved function ofu3 - u + 1 + . in x. From the initialx and$datainto (26)$.
If we now differentiate the equation (26) withu0 we can determine . artial x u(x0) by substituting x0 respect toequationx and apply the chain rule, we derive the. artial2 xu(x) = . artial x f (x, u(x)) + . artial uf (x, u(x)). artial x u(x), which for the example just defined works out to be$\cos x + 3u^{2}(x)\partial u(x) - \partial u(x)$. Hence, xx. artial x 2 u(x0) = . artial xf (x0, u0) + . artial uf (x0, u0)∂x u0, and since find that∂∂2 xu(xu(x0)) can also be explicitly calculated has already been determined we from the initial data the functionx fand its first partial derivatives.
Taking0$u^{0}$. This calculation also involves higher derivatives of the equation (26) we can recur-sively determine$\partial^{3}u(x )$, as well as all other higher derivatives of de term i neu(x)u with the help of the Taylor seriesatxx0. Therefore, one can in principle0 u(x) =k^⩾0 k1!. artia(lx)ku(x0)(x - x0)k = u(x0) + . artial x u(x0)(x - x0)+2!1$\partial x 2(x0)(x - x0)2 + · · ·$.

We say “in principle” because there is no guarantee that the series converges. There is, however, a very important theorem, called the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theoremlytic, as is certainly the case for our function, which asserts that if the functionf is real ana-f (x, u) =u3 - u + 1 + . in  x, then there will be some neighbor- hood J of x0 where the Taylor series converges to a real-analytic solutionto show that the solution thus obtained is the uni queu of the equation. It is then easy solution to (26) that satisfies the initial condition (27).To summarize:
iff is a well-behaved function, then the initial value problem for ODEs has a solution, at least in some time interval, and that solution is unique. The same result does not always hold if we consider a more general equation of the form a(x$, u(x))\partial^{x}u = f (x, u(x))$, u(x^0) = u^0. (28) Indeed, the recursive argument outlined above breaks down in the case of the scalar equation(x - x )∂ u =f (x, u)determine for the simple reason that we cannot even∂ u(x ) from the initial condition u((x0)x ) =uu0. A similar problem occurs for the equation)∂ u = f (x, u()x)0.
An obvious condition that allows us(u0 - to extend our previous recursive argument to (28) is to insist that0 x a(x , u ) ≠ 0. Otherwise, we say that the IVP (28) is characteristic0 0 . If botha and f are also real ana- lytic, the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem applies again and we obtain a unique, real-analytic solution of (28) in a small neighborhood of system,$x0$. In the case of an N . imes  NA(x$, u(x))\partial x u = F(x, u(x))$, u(x0) = u0$, A = A(x$, u) is an N . imes  N matrix, and the non character- istic condition becomes

$\det A(x^{0}$, u0) ≠ 0. (29)

It turns out, and this is extremely important in the development of the theory of ODEs, that, while the nondegeneracy condition (29) is essential to obtain a unique solution of the equation, the analyticity con-dition is not at all important: it can be replaced by a simple to assume, for example, that their first partial deriva-local Lipschitz condition for A and F. It suffices tives exist and that they are locally bounded. This is always the case if the first derivatives of A and F are continuous.

Partial Differential Equations unique solution2 udefined on Jthat satisfies the initial conditionsu(x0) = u0. The proof of the theorem is based on the Picard iteration method approximate solutions. The idea is to construct a sequence ofu(n)(x) that converge to the desired solution.
With out loss of generality we can assume A to be the identity matrix.3 One starts by settingu(0)(x) = u0 and then defines, recursively,$\partial xu}(n)(x) = F(x$, u(n - 1)(x))$, u(n - 1)(x0) = u0$. Observe that at every stage all we need to solve is a very simple linear problem, which makes Picard iteration easy to implement numerically. As we shall see below, variations of this method are also used for solving nonlinear PDEs. Remark.sharp, in the sense that its conditions cannot be In general, the local existence theorem is relaxed.
We have seen that the invertibility condition for A(x , u ) is necessary. Also, it is not always pos- sible to extend the interval exists to the whole of the real line. As an example,0 0 J in which the solution consider the nonlinear equation tial datau = u at x = 0, for which the solution. artial x u = u2 with ini-uthe terminology of PDEs, it = u0/(1 - x(u0)0)becomes infinite in finite time: in blows up. mentioned above, one can define the main goals of the mathematical theory of ODEs as follows.

It would be very helpful if a similar situation were to hold for general PDEs.

2.3 The Initial Value Problem for PDEs

In the one-dimensional situation one specifies initial conditions at a point. The natural higher-dimensional may not be analytic, but it does have continuous first derivatives.2. Since we are not assuming that3. Since A is invertible we can multiply both sides of the equation A and F are analytic, the solution by the inverse matrix$A^{-1}$.

analogue is to specify them on hypersurfaces H ⊂ Rd, that is,(d - 1)-dimensional subsets (or, to be more pre- cise, submanifolds). For a general equation of orderk, that is, one that involves ify the values ofuand of its firstk derivatives, we need to spec-k - 1 derivatives in the direction normal to H. For example, in the case of the second-order wave equation (3) and the initial hyper planet = 0 we need to specify initial data for u and. artial u.t obtaining a solution, it is important that the data If we wish to use initial data of this kind to start should not be degenerate.
(We have already seen thisin the case of ODEs.) For this reason, we make the following general definition. Definition.linear system of equations, and the initial data comes Suppose that we have akth-order quasi- in the form of the firstk - 1 normal derivatives that a solution that the system isu must satisfy on a hypersurface non characteristic at a point H. We sayx of H if we can use the initial data to determine formally allthe other higher partial derivatives ofu at x , in terms0 of the data.
helpful to imagine an infinitesimally small neighbor-hood of As a very rough picture to have in mind, it may bex . If the hypersurface H is smooth, then its intersection with this neighborhood will be a piece ofa(d - 1)-dimensional affine subspace. The values of0 uand the firstk - 1 normal derivatives on this inter- section are given by the initial data, and the problem of determining the other partial derivatives is a problem in linear algebra (because everything is infinitesi-mally small).
To say that the system is non characteristic atx0 is to say that this linear algebra problem can be uniquely solved, which is the case provided that a certain matrix is invertible. This is the nondegeneracy condition referred to earlier. To illustrate the idea, let us look at first-order equations in two space dimensions. In this caseΓ , and since k - 1 = 0 we must specify the restriction H is a curve$of$ u to Γ ⊂ R2 but we do not have to worry about any derivatives. Thus, we are trying to solve the system $a^{1}(x$, u(x))∂1 u(x) + a2(x, u(x))∂2 u(x)= f (x, u(x))$, u|^{Γ} = u^{0}$, (30)

That is, we cannot determine the first-order derivatives ofu uniquely in terms of the data u0. there is a direction such that if the hypersurface, which In terms of the rough picture above, at each point in this case is a line, is along that direction, then the resulting matrix is singular. If you follow this direction, then you travel along a characteristic curve.
Conversely, if the nondegeneracy condition a1(p, u(p))n1(p) + a2(p, u(p))n2(p) . eq 0 (31) is satisfied at some pointp = x(0) \in Γ , then we can determine all higher derivatives of terms of the datau and its derivatives alongu at x0 uniquely inΓ .

With a little more work one can extend the above discussion to higher-order equations in higher dimen-sions, and even to systems of equations.

This is the case, in particular, for the laplace equationΔu = f . Consider also the minimal surface equation (7) written in the form

Indeed, hij(. artial u)ξiξj= (1 + |. artial u|2)-1/2(|ξ|2 - (1 + |. artial u|2)-1(ξ · . artial u)2) > 0. Thus, even though (36) is not linear, we see that all surfaces in R2 are non characteristic.

The bi characteristics of the corresponding Hamiltonian systems are called bi characteristic curves of (39). Remark.(17) we have seen how knowledge of characteristics In the case of the first-order scalar equations can be used to find, implicitly, general solutions. Wehave also seen that singularities propagate only along characteristics. In the case of second-order equations the characteristics are not sufficient to solve the equa-tions, but they continue to provide important information, such as how the singularities propagate.
For example, in the case of the wave equation u = 0 with smooth initial data$p = (t$, x )$, \text{the solutionu}^{0}$, u^1 ueverywhere except at a point has singularities present at all points of the light cone0 0-(t - t0)2 + |x - x0|2 = 0 with vertex at shows that the singularities propagate along bicharac-$p$. A more refined version of this fact teristics. The general principle here is that singularities propagate along characteristic hypersurfaces of a Pde since this is a very important principle, it pays to give.
it a more precise formulation that extends to general boundary conditions, such as the Dirichlet condition for (1). Propagation of singularities. If the boundary conditions or the coefficients of a PDE are singular at some pointp, and otherwise smooth (or real analytic) every- where in some small neighborhood V of p, then a solu- tion of the equation cannot be singular in along a characteristic hypersurface passing through V exceptp.

467

In particular, if there are no such characteristic hyper-surfaces, then any solution of the equation must be smooth (or real analytic) at every point ofthanp. V other Remarks. (i) The heuristic principle mentioned above is in valid, in general, at large scales. Indeed, as we have shown in the case of the Burgers equation, solutions to nonlinear evolution equations can develop new sin-gularities whatever the smoothness of the initial conditions. Global versions of the principle can be formu-lated for linear equations based on the bi characteristics of the equation. See (iii) below.
(ii) According to the principle, it follows that any solu-tion of the equation. elta u = f, satisfying the bound- ary condition merely has to be continuous, is automatically smoo thu|. artial D = u0 with a boundary value u0 that every where in the interior of smooth there. More over, the solution is real analytic if D provided that f itself isf is real analytic. (iii) More precise versions of this principle, which playsa fundamental role in the general theory, can be given for linear equations.
In the case of the general wave equation (39), for example, one can show that singularities propagate along bi characteristics. These are the bi characteristic curves associated with the Hamilton Jacobi equation (40). 2.4 The Cauchy–Kovalevskaya Theorem In the case of ODEs we have seen that a non character is-tic IVP always admits solutions locally (that is, in some time interval about a given point). Is there a higher-dimensional analogue of this fact?
The answer is yes, provided that we restrict ourselves to the real-analytic situation, which is covered by an appropriate extension of the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem. More pre - cisely, one can consider general quasilinear equations, or systems, with real-analytic coefficients, real-analytic hypersurfaces H , and appropriate real-analytic initial data on H .

The CK theorem shows that, given the non characteristic condition and the ana-lyticity assumptions, the following straightforward way of finding solutions works: look for a formal expansionof the kindu(x) = C (x - x )α by determining the constant sl as arising from the equation and initial conditions on Cα recursively from simple algebraic formu-α α 0 H.
More precisely, the theorem ensures that the naive expansion obtained in this way converges in a small neighborhood ofx ∈ H . required by the CK theorem are much too restrictive, and therefore the apparent generality of the result It turns out, however, that the analyticity conditions0 is misleading. A first limitation becomes immediately apparent when we consider the wave equation$u = 0$.

2.5 Standard Classification

The different behavior of the Laplace and wave equa-tions mentioned above illustrates the fundamental difference between ODEs and PDEs and the illusory generality of the CK theorem. Given that these two equations are so important in geometric and physical applications, it is of great interest to find the broadest classes of equations with which they share their main properties. The equations modeled by the Laplace equation are called elliptic, while those modeled by the wave equation are calledtant models are the heat equation (see (2)) and the hyperbolic.

Elliptic equations are the most robust and the eas Definition. A linear, or quasilinear, N . imes N system with no characteristic hypersurfaces is called elliptic.
Equations of type (32) whose coefficients aij satisfy condition (35) are clearly elliptic. The minimal surface equation (7) is also elliptic. It is also easy to verify that the Cauchy–Riemann system (12) is elliptic. As was pointed out by Hadamard, the IVP is not well-posed for elliptic equations. The natural way of parametrizing theset of solutions to an elliptic PDE is to prescribe conditions for derivatives will be roughly half the order of the equa - u, and some of its derivatives (the number of tion) at the boundary of a domain D ⊂ Rn.

A typical problem of general theory is to classify all well-posed BVPs for a given elliptic system. As a consequence of our propagation-of-singularities principle, we deduce, heuristically at least, the follow-ing general fact:
Classical solutions of elliptic equations with smooth(or real-analytic) coefficients in a regular domain D are smooth (or real analytic) in the interior ofthe degree of smoothness of the boundary conditions. D, whatever6 the IVP is well-posed. In that sense, they provide the natural class of equations for which one can prove Hyperbolic equations are, essentially, those for which a result similar to the local existence theorem for ODEs.

However, it fails to be well-posed for timelike hypersurfaces, for which there may be no solution with prescribed, nonanalytic, Cauchy data. hyperbolicity.
Roughly speaking, hyperbolic equations are at the opposite end of the spectrum from ellip-It is more difficult to give algebraic conditions for tic equations: where as elliptic equations have no char-acteristic hypersurfaces, hyperbolic equations have as many as possible passing through any given point. Oneof the most useful classes of hyperbolic equations, which includes most of the important known examples, consists of equations of the form $A^{0}(t$, x, u)∂tu +i=d 1 Ai(t, x, u)∂iu = F(t, x, u)$, u|H = u0$, (42) where all the coefficients$A0$, A1, . . .

A system (42) that satisfies these conditions is called symmetric hyperbolic. In the particular case whenψ(t$, x) = t, \text{the condition} (43) becomes$(A0ξ, ξ) ⩾ c|ξ|2 ∀ξ \in  RN.

The following is a fundamental result in the theory of general hyperbolic equations. It is called the local existence and uniqueness of solutions for symmetric hyperbolic systems.

Remarks.essential, just as it was for the general propagation-(i) The local character of the theorem is of-singularities principle discussed earlier, since the result cannot be globalized in the particular case ofthe Burgers equation (21), which fits trivially into the framework of general nonlinear symmetric hyperbolic systems.
A precise version of the theorem above gives a lower bound on how large D can be. (ii) The proof of the theorem is based on a variation ofthe Picard iteration method that we encountered earlier for ODEs. One starts by takinghood of$H$. Then one defines functions(u(()0){)} = uu0 in a neighbor - recursively(n)

as follows:

$A^{0}(t$, x, u((n-1)))∂tu(n) +i=d 1 Ai(t, x, u((n-1)))∂iu(n)= F(t, x, u((n-1)))$, u^{(}n)|H = u^{0}$.

Notice that at each stage of the iteration we have to solve a linear equation. Linearization is an extremely important tool in studying nonlinear PDEs. We can almost never understand their behavior with out linear iz-ing them around important special solutions. Thus, almost invariably, hard problems in nonlinear Pdes reduce to understanding specific problems in linear PDEs. (iii) To implement the Picard iteration method we needto get precise estimates concerningu in terms ofu((n-1)). This step requires energy type a priori esti-^(n) mates, which we will discuss in section 3.3.
Another important property of hyperbolic equations (which is not shared by elliptic, parabolic, or disper-sive equations) is finite speed of propagation, which was mentioned earlier in the case of the wave equa-tion (3). Consider this simple case again. The IVP can be solved explicitly by the so-called The formula allows us to conclude that if the initial Kirchhoff formula. data ata > 0 centered att = 0 is zero out side a ballx \in  R3, then at time Ba(x0)t >of radius0 the solution eral, finite speed of propagation can best be formulatedu is zero out side the ball0 Ba+ct(x0).

hyperbolic equations (see the online version for general definitions). as they are intimately tied to the relativistic nature Hyperbolic PDEs play a fundamental role in physics, of the modern theory of fields. Equations (3), (5), (13)are the simplest examples of linear field theories, and they are manifestly hyperbolic.

For exam-ple, one can show that if the coefficients aij and f are smooth (or real analytic), then the solution smooth (or real analytic inx) for t > t even if the ini - u must be tial datau0 is not smooth, which is consistent with our0 propagation - of-singularities principle. The heat equa-tion smooths out initial conditions. It is for this reason that the heat equation is useful in many applications.
In physics, parabolic PDEs arise whenever diffusion or dissipation phenomena are important, while in geometry and calculus of variations, parabolic PDEs often arise as gradient flows of positive-definite functionals. Ricci flow (16) can also be viewed as a parabolic PDE, after a suitable change of coordinates. Dispersive PDEs, of which the Schrödinger equation (4) is a fundamental example, are evolution equations that behave analogously to hyperbolic PDEs in many respects. For instance, the IVP tends to be locally well-posed both forward and backward in time.
How - ever, solutions to dispersive PDEs do not propagate along characteristic surfaces. Instead, they move at speeds that are determined by their spatial frequency; in general, high-frequency waves tend to propagate atmuch greater speeds than low-frequency waves, which eventually leads to a increasingly large areas of space. In fact, the speed dispersion of the solution into of propagation of solutions is typically infinite.
this behavior also differs from that of parabolic equations, which tend toof a solution (sending them to zero) rather than dis-dissipate the high-frequency components persing them. In physics, dispersive equations arise in quantum mechanics: they are the nonrelativistic limit c →. nftyof relativistic equations and they are also approximations to model certain types of fluid behav - ior. For instance, the korteweg–de vries equation [III.49](/part - 03/linear - and - nonlinear - waves - and - solitons),

While the related issues of classification, well - posedness, and propaga-tion of singularities have dominated the study of lin - 471 ear equations, there are other issues of interest as well, including the following.
2.6.1 Local Solvability This is the problem of determining the conditions ona linear operator P and given data f under which the equation (9) is locally solvable. The Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem gives a criterion for local solvability when fand the coefficients of P are real analytic, but it is a remarkable phenomenon that when one relaxes this assumption slightly, asking forf to be smooth rather than real analytic, serious obstructions to local solvability appear.
For instance, the Lewy operator P[u](t, z) = . artial u. artial$\bar{z}(t, z) - iz \partial u\partial t (t, z)$, defined on complex-valued functions$u$: R$\times C \to C$, has the property that equation (9) is locally solvable for real-analytic$f$but not for “most” smoot hf . The Lewy operator is intimately connected to the tangential Cauchy–Riemann equations on the Heisenberg group in C2. It was discovered in the study of the restriction of the two-dimensional analogue of the Cauchy–riemann operator P to a quadric in C^2.
This example was the starting point for the theory ofgoal is to characterize linear equations that are locally local solvability, whose solvable. The theory of Cauchy–Riemann manifolds—which has its origin in the study of restrictions of the Cauchy–Riemann equations (in higher dimensions)to real hypersurfaces, each of which comes with an associated “tangential Cauchy–Riemann complex”—is another extremely rich source of examples of inter-esting linear PDEs, which do not fit into the standard classification.

2.6.2 Unique Continuation

This concerns various ill-posed problems where solu-tions may not always exist, but one still has uniqueness. A fundamental example is that oftinuation: two holomorphic functions on a connected analytic condomainor an interval) must necessarily agree every where on D that agree on a nondiscrete set (such as a disk D. This fact can be viewed as a unique continuation result for the Cauchy–Riemann equations (12).
Another example in a similar spirit is Holmgren’s theorem, which asserts that solutions to a linear PDE (9) that has real-analytic coefficients and data are unique, even in the class of smooth functions. More generally, the study of

472

ill-posed problems (such as the wave equation with pre-scribed data on a timelike surface rather than a spacelike one) arises naturally in connection with control theory.

2.6.3 Spectral Theory

There is no way I can even begin to give an account of this theory, which is of fundamental importance not only to quantum mechanics and other physical theories, but also to geometry and analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Just as a matrix A can often be analyzed through itsby the tools of linear algebra, one can learn much about eigenvalues and eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) a linear differential operator P and its associated PDE by understanding that operator’se i gen functions with the help of tools from spectrum
functional[III.86](/part-03/the-spectrum) and analysisis the eigenvalue problem[IV.15](/part-04/operator-algebras). A typical problem in spectral theory in R$d$:

$-\Delta u(x) + V (x)u(x) = \lambda u(x)$.

A function being bounded in theu that is localized in space (for example, by L2(Rd)-norm) and that satisfies this equation is mapped by the linear operator$-\Delta + V$ to the function with eigenvalue. ambda uλ.: we say thatu is an eigenfunctionφ(t, x)solution of the Schrödinger equation Suppose that we have an eigenfunction= (e-i). ambda tu(x). It is easy to check thatu and letφ is a$i$∂ φ + Δφ - V φ = 0. (47)t

More over, it has a very special form. Such solutions are called bound states of the physical system described by (47). The eigenvalues correspond to the quantum energy levels of the sys-λ, which form a discrete set, tem. They are very sensitive to the choice of potential V . The inverse spectral problem is also important: can one determine the potential V from knowledge of the corresponding eigenvalues? The eigenvalue problem can be studied in considerable generality by replacing the operator-Δ + V with other elliptic operators.
For instance, in geometry it is important to study the eigen-value problem for the Laplace–Beltrami operator, which is the natural generalization of the Laplace operator from Rn to general[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). When the manifold has some arithmetic structure (for instance, if it is the quotient of the upper half-plane by riemannian manifolds a discrete arithmetic group), this problem is of major importance in number theory, leading, for instance, tothe theory of Hecke–Maas forms. A famous problem in differential geometry (“can you hear the shape of

IV. Branches of Mathematics

a drum?”) is to characterize the metric on a compact surface from the spectral properties of the associated Laplace–Beltrami operator.

2.6.4 Scattering Theory

This theory formalizes the intuition from quantum mechanics that a potential which is small or localizedis largely unable to “trap” a quantum particle, which is therefore likely to escape to infinity in a manner resem-bling that of a free particle. In the case of equation (47), solutions that scatter are those that behave freely ast → $\infty$. That is, they behave like solutions to the free Schrödinger equation i$\partial ψ + \Deltaψ = 0$. A typical prob - t

lem in scattering theory is to show that, ifto zero sufficiently fast as|x| → $\infty$, all solutions, except V (x) tends the bound states, scatter ast → $\infty$.

2.7 Conclusions

In the analytic case, the CK theorem allows us to solve the IVP locally for very general classes of PDEs. We have a general theory of characteristic hypersurfaces of PDEs and a good general understanding of how they relate to propagation of singularities. We can also distinguish in considerable generality the fundamental classes ofelliptic and hyperbolic equations and can define general parabolic and dispersive equations. The IVP for a large class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems can be solved locally in time, for sufficiently smooth initial conditions.
Similar local-in-time results hold for gen-eral classes of nonlinear parabolic and dispersive equations. For linear equations a lot more can be done. We have satisfactory results concerning the regularity of solutions for elliptic and parabolic equations and a good understanding of the propagation of singular-ities for a large class of hyperbolic equations. Some aspects of spectral theory and scattering theory and problems of unique continuation can also be studied in considerable generality. passage from local to global.
Important global featuresof special equations are too subtle to fit into a general The main defect of the general theory concerns the scheme. Rather, each important PDE requires special treatment. This is particularly true for nonlinear equations: the long-term behavior of solutions is very sen-sitive to the special features of the equation at hand. More over, general points of view may obscure, through unnecessary technical complications, the main proper-ties of the important special cases. A useful general framework is one that provides a simple and elegant

IV.12. Partial Differential Equations

treatment of a particular phenomenon, as is the case for symmetric hyperbolic systems and the phenomenon of local well-posedness and finite speed of propaga-tion. However, it turns out that symmetric hyperbolic systems are simply too general for the study of more refined questions about the important examples of hyperbolic equations.
3 General Ideas As one turns away from the general theory, one maybe inclined to accept the pragmatic point of view described earlier, according to which PDEs is not areal subject but is rather a collection of subjects such as hydrodynamics, general relativity, several complex variables, elasticity, etc., each organized around a special equation. However, this rather widespread view-point has its own serious drawbacks. Even though specific equations have specific properties, the tools that are used to derive them are intimately related.
In fact, there is an impressive body of knowledge relevant to all important equations, or at least large classes of them. Lack of space does not allow me to do anything more than enumerate them below.9

3.1 Well-Posedness

As is clear from the previous section, well-posed problems are at the heart of the modern theory of PDEs. Recall that these are problems that admit unique solutions for given smooth initial or boundary conditions, and that the corresponding solutions have to depend continuously on the data. It is this condition that leads to the classification of PDEs into elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and dispersive equations. The first step inthe study of a nonlinear evolution equation is a proof of a local-in-time existence and uniqueness theorem, simi-lar to the one for ODEs.
Ill-posedness, the counterpart of well-posedness, is also important in many applications. The Cauchy problem for the wave equation (3), with data on the timelike hypersurface$z = 0$, is a typical example. Ill-posed problems appear naturally in con-trol theory, as we have mentioned, and also in inverse scattering. important functional analytic tools connected to Hilbert space meth-ods, compactness, the implicit function theorems, etc. I also fail to9.
I fail to mention in the few examples given above some of the mention the importance of probabilistic methods and the develop-ment of topological methods for dealing with global properties of elliptic PDEs.

(49) After some work, one can reexpress formula (49) in the form u(t$, x) = \partial t (4πt)-1^{(}|x)-y^{|} = t u0(y) da(y)$, (50) where da is the area element of the sphere |x-y | = t of radius formula$t$. By contrast with (49), the integration here iscentered at x. This is the well-known Kirchhoff with respect to the physical variablest and x only. It is instructive to compare these two formulas.
Using the Plancherel identity it is very easy to deduce from (49) the L2 bound|u(t, x)|2 dx ⩽ C (u0()2)L2 ( R 3 ), while the possibility of obtaining such a bound from R3 (50) seems unlikely since the formula involves a deriva - tive. On the other hand, (50) is perfect for giving us information about the domain of influence. Indeed, we can see immediately from the formula that if out side the ball B = {|x - x | ⩽ a}, then uu(t, x)0 is zerois zero out side the balla (Ba)+(|t)| for any time0 t. This fact does not seem at all transparent in the Fourier-based formula (49).
The fact that different representations of solutions have different, even opposite, strengths and weaknesses has important consequences for con-struc ting approximate solutions, or parametrices, for more complicated equations, such as linear equations with variable coefficients or nonlinear wave equations. There are two possible types of constructions: those in physical space, which mimic the physical-space for-mula (50), and those in Fourier space, which mimic the formula (49).

3.3 A Priori Estimates

Most equations cannot be solved explicitly. However, if we are interested in qualitative information about a solution, then it is not necessary to derive it from an exact formula. But how else, one might wonder, can we

and the identity holds for all functions twice continuously differentiable and tend to zero asu that are|x| → . nfty. This formula can be justified fairly simply by integrating by parts. As a consequence of the bochner identity, we obtain the a priori estimate that ifu is a smooth solution to the Poisson equation (6) with square-integrable dataf, and if it tends to zero at infinity, then the square integral of its second derivatives is bounded:
Thus we obtain the qualitative fact that, on average(in a mean-square sense), R$d |\partial^{2}u(x)|^{2} dx ⩽^{R}^{d}u|f (x)$has “two more degrees$|^{2} dx < \infty$.

The method is very robust and can easily be extended to a large class of second-order elliptic equations. It can also be extended to parabolic equations and systems, and plays a crucial role in, for example, the study of Ricci flow. of a priori estimates.
The Sobolev inequalities, which are of prime importance in elliptic equations, have Let us briefly mention some other important classes several counterparts in linear and nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive equations, including the estimates and bilinear estimates.

According to this philosophy we start by making educated assumptions about the solutions we are trying to describe.
These assumptions allow us to think of the original nonlinear problem asa linear one whose coefficients satisfy properties consistent with the assumptions. We may then use linear methods, based on other a priori estimates that we already know, to try to show that the solutions to this linear problem behave as well as we have postulated—in fact, even better. One can characterize this powerful method, which allows us to use linear theory with out actually having to linearize the equation, as atual linearization.
It can also be regarded as a continu-concepity argument relative to some parameter, which might be the natural time parameter of an evolution problem, but it could also be an artificial parameter which we have the freedom to introduce ourselves. This latter situation is typical of applications to nonlinear elliptic equations. In the online version of this article we pro-vide a few examples to illustrate the method in both cases.
3.5 The Method of Generalized Solutions Since a PDE involves differentiation, it might seem obvious that in any discussion of PDEs we should restrict our attention to differentiable functions. However, it is possible to generalize the notion of differentiation so that it makes sense for a wider class of functions, and even for function-like objects, such as distributions, that are not functions at all. This allows us to make sense of a PDE in a broader context, and admits the possibility of generalized solutions.
PDEs and explain why they are important is through the The best way to introduce generalized solutions in Dirichlet principle. This originates in the observation that, out of all functions that are defined ona bounded domain D ⊂ Rd, that satisfy prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditionan appropriate functional spaceu|. artial DX , the functions = f , and that live inu that minimize the Dirichlet integral (or Dirichlet functional) d(u2)Dr = 12 D |∇u|2 = 12 = D |. artial iu|2 (52) are the harmonic functions (that is, solutions of the equation$\Delta u = 0)$.
It was riemann i[VI.49] who first had1 476 the idea of trying to use this fact to solve the dirichlet problem: in order to find a solution u to the problem. elta u = 0, u|. artial D = u0, (53) one should find (by some means other than solving the Dirichlet problem) a functionu that minimizes the Dirichlet integral while equaling one must specify the set by functions, or rather theu0 on . artial D. To do this, function space, over which the minimization is taking place. The history of how this choice was made is a fascinating one.
A natural choice is X = C1(D) ̄ , the space of continuously differentiable functions o. ar{n}the norm of a functionv is D, where(v C)1(D)^ ̄ = . upx\in D(|v(x)| + |∂v(x)|). In particular, the Dirichlet normv belongs to this space. In fact, Riemann chosev Dris finite when X =C2(D) ̄ (a similar space but designed for twice continuously differentiable functions). This bold but flawed attempt was followed by a penetrating criticism by weierstrass does not have to achieve its minimum in either[VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), who showed that the functional$C2(D)$ ̄ or$C^{1}(D)$ ̄ .
However, Riemann’s basic idea was revived, and it eventually triumphed after a long and inspir-ing process that involved defining appropriate function spaces, introducing the notion of generalized solutions, and developing a regularity theory for them. (The precise formulation of the Dirichlet principle also requires the definition of sobolev spaces [III.29 §2.4](/part-03/function-spaces).) been vastly extended so that it can be applied to a large class of linear Let us briefly summarize the method, which has since13 and nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. It is based on two steps.
In the first step one applies a minimization procedure. Although, as Weierstrass discovered, the natural function spaces may not contain functions that achieve the minimum, one canuse such a procedure to find a generalized solution instead. This may not seem very interesting, since wewere looking for a function that solves the Dirichlet problem (or one of the other problems to which the method can be applied). But this is where the second step comes in:
it is some times possible to show that the generalized solution must in fact be a classical solu-tion (that is, an appropriately smooth function) after all. This is the “regularity theory” mentioned earlier. In some situations, however, the generalized solution may turn out to have singularities and therefore notbe regular. Then the challenge is to understand the

nature of these singularities and to prove realistic ti al regularity results. For instance, it is some times pos-par si ble to prove that the generalized solution is smooth every where apart from in a small “exceptional set.”Though generalized solutions are at their most effective for elliptic problems, their range of applicability encompasses all PDEs. For example, we have already seen that the fundamental solutions to the basic linear equations have to be interpreted as distributions, which are examples of generalized solutions.
successful for nonlinear evolution problems, such as systems of conservation laws in one space dimension. The notion of generalized solutions has also proved An excellent example is provided by the Burgers equa-tion (21). As we have seen, solutions to$\partial u + u\partial u =$ 0 develop singularities in finite time no matter how smooth the initial conditions are. It is natural to ask$t^{x}$ whether solutions continue to make sense, as general-ized solutions, even beyond the time when these singularities form.
A natural notion of generalized solutionis a function$u$ such that(∂tu + u∂x u)φ = 0

for every smooth function bounded set, since one can make sense of the integral R1+1 φ that is zero out side a even when ing this by parts (the first term with respect touis not a differentiable function.

Today we have a satis- factory theory of global solutions to a large class of hyperbolic systems of one-dimensional “conservation laws.” These systems, for which the above-mentioned theory applies, are called strictly hyperbolic. the question of what constitutes a good concept ofa generalized solution, though fundamental, is far For more complicated nonlinear evolution equations, murkier. For higher-dimensional evolution equations the first concept of a weak solution was introduced by Leray. Let us call a generalized solution not prove any type of uniqueness for it.
This unsatisfac-weak if one cantory situation may be temporary, i.e., the result of our technical inabilities, or unavoidable, in the sense that the concept itself is flawed. Leray was able to produce, by a compactness method, a weak solution of the IVP

for the advantage of the compactness method (and its mod-navier–stokes equations [III.23](/part-03/the-euler-and-navierstokes-equations). The great ern extensions, which can, in some cases, cleverly cir-cumvent lack of compactness) is that it produces global solutions for all data. This is particularly important for supercritical or critical nonlinear evolution equations, which we will discuss later. For these we expect clas-sical solutions to develop singularities in a finite time. The problem, however, is that one has very little con-trol over such solutions.
In particular, we do not know how to prove their uniqueness.14 Similar types of solutions were later introduced for other important non-linear evolution equations. In most of the interesting cases of supercritical evolution equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, the usefulness of the types of weak solutions discovered so far remains undecided.

3.6 Microlocal Analysis, Parametrices, and

para differential Calculus

One of the fundamental difficulties of hyperbolic and dispersive equations is the interplay between geometric properties, which concern the physical space, and other properties, intimately tied to oscillations, that are best seen in Fourier space. Microlocal analysis is a general still-developing philosophy according to which one isolates the main difficulties by careful localizations in physical space or Fourier space or both.
An important application of this point of view is the construction of parametrices for linear hyperbolic equations and their use in proving results about the propagation of singu-larities. Parametrices, as we have already mentioned, are approximate solutions of linear equations with vari-able coefficients, with error terms that are smoother. The local analysis to nonlinear equations.

3.7 Scaling Properties of Nonlinear Equations

Essentially, all basic nonlinear equa-tions have well-defined scaling properties. Take, for example, the Burgers equation (21),. artial tu + u. artial xu = 0. If other researchers after him, he was unable to prove uniqueness ofhis weak solution, he managed to show that it must coincide with a14. Leray was very concerned about this point. Though, like all classical one as long as the latter does not develop singularities.

uu is a solution of this equation, then so is the function defined byu (t, x) = u(. ambda t, . ambda x). Similarly, if u is a solution of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation in R$d^{λ}$,λ$i$∂ u + Δu + c|u|2 u = 0, (54)t

then so is between the nonlinear scaling of the equation and$u^{λ}(t$, x) = . ambda u(λ2 t, . ambda x). The relationship the a priori estimates available for solutions to the equations leads to an extremely useful classification of equations into subcritical, critical, and supercritical equations. This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
For the moment it suffices to say that subcritical equations are those for which the nonlinearity can be controlled by the existing a priori estimates of the equation, while supercritical equations are those for which the nonlinearity appears to be stronger. Critical equations are borderline. The definition of critical-ity and its relationship with the issue of regularity play a very important heuristic role in nonlinear PDEs. One expects supercritical equations to develop singularities and subcritical equations not to.
4 The Main Equations In the previous section we argued that, while there isno hope of finding a general theory of all PDEs, there is nevertheless a wealth of general ideas and techniques that are relevant to the study of almost all important equations. In this section we indicate how it may bepossible to identify the features that characterize the equations we call important. Most of our basic PDEs can be derived from simple geometric principles, which happen to coincide with some of the underlying geometric principles of modern physics.
These simple principles provide a unifying framework15 for the subject and help endow it with a sense of purpose and cohesion. They also explain why a very small number of linear differential opera - tors, such as the Laplacian and the d’Alembertian, are all - pervasive. Let us begin with the operators. The Laplacian is the simplest differential operator that is invariant under rigid motions of Euclidean space—a fact that we noted at the beginning of this article. This is important math-ematically and physically:

The scheme sketched below is only an attempt to show that, in ples that unite them. I do not want, by any means, to imply that the equations discussed below are the only ones worthy of our attention. 478 results in many symmetry properties and physically because many physical laws are themselves invariant under rigid motions.
The d’Alembertian is, simi - larly, the simplest differential operator that is invariant under the natural symmetries, or Poincaré transforma - tions, of Minkowski space. view of physics, the heat equation is basic because it isthe simplest paradigm for diffusive phenomena, while Now let us turn to the equations.

4.1 Variational Equations

There is a general and extremely effective method for generating equations with prescribed symmetries that plays a fundamental role in both physics and geometry. One starts with a scalar quantity, called a Lagrangian, such as $L[φ] = {}^{\mu}$,ν3=0 mμν ∂μφ∂νφ - V (φ)$, (55) with$φa real-valued function defined on R1$+3 and V$ some real function of$φ^{3}$.
Here ∂ denotes the partial derivatives with respectφ such as, for example, V (φ) = to the coordinates as earlier, denotes the 4\mu x^μ, μ. imes =4 diagonal matrix with diago-0, 1, 2, 3, and m^μν = m^μν, nal entries(-1, 1, 1, 1), associated with the Minkowski diagletting16.

metric. We associate with L[φ] the so-called action integral: S[φ] =R 3 +1 L[φ].

Notice that both L[φ] and S[φ] are invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. In other words, if$T$: R1+3 \to  (R1)+3 is a function that does not change the metric and we define a new function byψ(t$, x) = φ(T (t, x))$, then L[φ] = L[ψ] and S[φ] =S[ψ].

From this we wish to deduce that the derivative of We shall consider a function S at φ, in some appropriate sense, is zero,φ that minimizes the and hence to deduce other properties aboutφis a function that lives in an infinite-dimensionalφ. But space, so we cannot talk about derivatives in a com-pletely straightforward way. To deal with this problem, we define aparameter family of functions compact variation ofφφ(s)to be a smooth one-:

In view of the action principle and the arbitrariness ofφ ̇ we infer thatφ must satisfy equation (56). Thus (56) is indeed the Euler–Lagrange equation associated with the Lagrangian$L[φ] = m^{\mu}\nu\partial φ\partial φ - V (φ)$. One can similarly show that the Maxwell equations$\mu^{\nu}$ of ele ct ro magnetism—along with their beautiful exten-sions to the Yang–Mills equations, wave maps, and the Einstein equations of general relativity—are also variational. That is, they too can be derived from a Lagrangian.

Examples of such conservation laws are the familiar laws of conservation of energy, conservation ofmomentum, and conservation of angular momentum, all of which have important physical meaning. (The one-parameter group of symmetries for energy, for example, is just translations in time.) In the case of equation(56), the law of conservation of energy takes the form

$E(t) = E(0)$, (57)

where the quantity E(t), which equalsΣt 1 2(. artial t φ)2 + 12 i = 1(. artial iφ)2 + V (φ) dx, (58) is called thethe set of all points total energy(t, x, y, z)at timeas (x, y, z)t.

Indeed, if the energy of the initial data at t = 0 is finite (that is, if$E(0) < \infty )$, thenΣt 1 2(. artial tφ)2 + 12 i=1(. artial iφ)2 dx ⩽ E(0).
We say that the energy identity (57) is means that it leads to an absolute bound on all solu-coercive, which tions with finite initial energy.

4.2 The Issue of Criticality

For the most basic evolution equations of mathematical physics, there are typically no better a priori estimates known than those provided by the energy. Taking into account the scaling properties of the corresponding equations as well, one is led to the very important classification of our basic equations, mentioned earlier, into see how this is done, consider again the nonlinear subcritical, critical, and supercritical equations. To scalar equationbe(1/(p + 1))|φ|^pφ^+^1-. Recall that the energy integral is V^ (φ) = 0, and take V (φ) to given by (58).
If we assign to the spacetime variables the dimension of length, have dimension L-1 and therefore L, then the spacetime derivatives has the dimension of sides of the equation$L^{-2}$. To be able to balance the left- and right-handφ = |φ|p^-1φ, we need to assign a length scale toφ; we find this to be L2/(1-p). Thus the energy integral, E(t) = {}Rd(2-1|. artialφ|2 + |φ(|p)+1) dx,

has the dimension responding to the volume element d$L^{c}$, c = d-2+(4/(1 x-p))= d, withx1 dxd2 cor-· · · ds ub critical$x^{d}$, which scales likeif c < 0, critical Ld. We say that the equation isif c = 0, and supercritical$if$ c > 0. Thus, for example, φ - φ5 = 0 is critical in dimensiond = 3. The same sort of dimensional analy- sis can be done for all our other basic equations. an evolutionary PDE is said to be regular if all smooth finite-energy initial conditions lead to global smooth solutions.
It is conjectured that all subcritical equations are regular, but one expects supercritical equa-tions to develop singularities. Critical equations are important borderline cases. The heuristic reason for this is that the nonlinearity tends to produce singu-larities while the coercive estimates prevent it. In subcritical equations the coercive estimates are stronger, while for supercritical equations it is the nonlinearity that is stronger. However, there may be other, more subtle a priori estimates that are not accounted for byour crude heuristic argument.
Thus, some supercritical equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, may still be regular.

4.3 Other Equations

Many other familiar equations can be derived from the variational ones described above by the following procedures.

4.3.1 Symmetry Reductions

Some times a PDE is very hard to solve but becomes much easier if one places additional symmetry constraints on solutions. For example, if the PDE is rota-tion invariant and we look just for rotation-invariant solutionsas functions ofu(t, x)t , then we can regard these solutions and r = |x|, effectively reducing the dimension of the problem. By this procedure of symmetry reductionis much simpler than the original one. Another, some-one can then derive a new PDE that what more general, way of obtaining simpler equationsis to look for solutions that satisfy some further property.
For instance, one can assume that they are stationary (that is, that they do not depend on the time vari-able), spherically symmetric, self-similar (which means thatu(t$, x) \text{depends only on} x/t^{a})$, or traveling waves (which means thatu(t, x) depends only on x - vt for some fixed velocity vector obtained by such reductions have a variational struc-v). Typically, the equations ture themselves. In fact, the symmetry reduction canbe applied directly to the original Lagrangian. IV.
Branches of Mathematics 4.3.2 The Newtonian Approximation and Other Limits We can derive a large class of new equations asthe basic ones described above by taking one or more limits of characteristic speeds to infinity. The most important example is the letting the velocity of light go to infinity. As we have Newtonian limit, which is obtained by already mentioned, the Schrödinger equation can be derived in this way from the linear Klein–Gordon equation. Similarly, we can derive the Lagrangians for the equations of nonrelativistic elasticity, fluid dynamics, or magnetohydrodyn amics.
It is an interesting fact that the nonrelativistic equations tend to look more messy than the relativistic ones. The simple geometric structure of the original equations gets lost in the limit. The remarkable simplicity of the relativistic equations is a powerful example of the importance of relativity as a unifying principle. Once we are in the familiar world of Newtonian physics we can perform other well-known limiting procedures.
The famous tions [III.23](/part - 03/the - euler - and - navierstokes - equations) are obtained by taking the limit of the incompressible euler equa general nonrelativistic fluid equations as the speed of sound tends to infinity. Various other limits are obtained relative to other characteristic speeds of the system or in connection with specific boundary conditions, such as the boundary-layer approximation in fluids. For example, in the limit as all characteristic speeds tend to infinity, the equations of elasticity turn into the familiar equations of a rigid body in classical mechanics.
4.3.3 Phe no meno logical Assumptions Even after taking various limits and making symmetry reductions, the equations may still remain intractable. However, in various applications it makes sense to assume that certain quantities are sufficiently small tobe neglected. This leads to simplified equations that could be called phe no meno logical18 in the sense that they are not derived from first principles. Phe no meno logical equations are “toy equations” that are used to illustrate and isolate important physical phenomena in complicated systems.
A typical way of generating interesting phe no meno logical equations isto try to write down the simplest model equation that what different context. Also, some of the equations that I call phe-no meno logical below, e.g., dispersive equations, can be given formal18. I use this term here quite freely; it is typically used in a some asymptotic derivations. IV.12. Partial Differential Equations still exhibits a particular feature of the original sys - tem.
For instance, the self-focusing plane-wave effects of compressible fluids or elasticity can be illustrated by the simple-minded Burgers equation u + uu =0. Nonlinear dispersive phenomena, typical of fluids, can be illustrated by the famous Korteweg–de Vries tx equation$u^{t} + uu^{x} + u^{x}xx =$0. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (54) provides a good model problem for nonlinear dispersive effects in optics. basic insights into the original equation itself.
For this reason, simplified model problems are also essential If it is well chosen, a model equation can lead to in the day-to-day work of the rigorous researcher into PDEs, who tests ideas on carefully selected model problems. It is crucial to emphasize that good results con-cerning the basic physical equations are rare; a very large percentage of important rigorous work in Pdes deals with simplified equations selected, for technical reasons, to isolate and focus our attention on some specific difficulties present in the basic equations.

Diffusive equations can often be interpreted as the gradient flow for an associ-ated elliptic variational problem.
They can be used to construct nontrivial stationary solutions to the corre-sponding stationary systems, in the limit ast → $\infty$, or to produce foliations with remarkable properties, such as one that was used recently in the proof of a famous conjecture of Penrose. As we have already mentioned, this idea has recently found an extraordinary applica-tion in the work of Perelman, who has used Ricci flow to settle the three-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. One such as energy, are not conserved and may in fact decrease in time. These are typically of parabolic type.19.

of his main new ideas was to interpret Ricci flow as a gradient flow.

4.4 Regularity or Breakdown

An additional source of unity for the subject of PDEsis the central role played by the problem of regularity or breakdown of solutions to the basic equations. It is intimately tied to the fundamental mathematical ques-tion of understanding what we actually mean by solutions and, from a physical point of view, to the issue of understanding the limits of validity of the corresponding physical theories.
Thus, in the case of the burgers equation, for example, the problem of singularities can be tackled by extending our concept of solutions to accommodate shock waves, which are solutions that are discontinuous across certain curves in the In this case one can define a function space of general-(t, x)-space. ized solutions in which the IVP has unique, global solutions.
Though the situation for more realistic physical systems is far less clear and far from being satisfactorily solved, the generally held opinion is that shock-wave-type singularities can be accommodated with out breaking the boundaries of the physical theory at hand. The situation for singularities in general relativity isradically different. The singularities one expects there are such that no continuation of solutions is possible with out altering the physical theory itself. The prevailing opinion here is that only a gravitational quantum field theory could achieve this.
5 General Conclusions What, then, is the modern theory of PDEs? As a first approximation, one could say that it is the pursuit ofthe following main goals. (i)equations of mathematical physics.

Indeed, many subcritical equations have been proved to be regular even though welack a general procedure for establishing regularity results of this kind. The situation with supercritical equations is far more subtle. To start with, an equation that we now call supercritical22 may in fact turn out to be critical, or even subcritical, upon the discov-ery of additional a priori estimates. Thus an important question concerning the issue of criticality, and conse-quently that of singular behavior, is:
are there other, stronger, local a priori bounds that cannot be derived from Noether’s principle? The discovery of such a bound would be a major event in both mathematics and physics. ties in our basic evolution equations is unavoidable, we Once we understand that the presence of singular i have to face the question of whether they can some-how be accommodated by a more general concept of what a solution is or whether their structure is such that the equation itself, indeed the physical theory that it under lies, becomes meaning less.
An acceptable concept of a generalized solution should, of course, preserve the deterministic nature of the equations: in other words, it should be uniquely determined from its Cauchy data. Finally, once an acceptable concept of generalized solutions is found, we would like to use it to deter-mine some important qualitative features, such as longterm asymptotic behavior. One can formulate a limit-less number of such questions, the answers to which will vary from equation to equation.

Understand in a rigorous mathematical fashion the The equations obtained by various limiting procedures or phe-no meno logical assumptions can of course be studied in their own right, as the examples that we have referred to above are. However, they present us with additional problems to do with the mechanics of how they are derived from equations that we regard as more fundamental.
It is entirely possible, for exam-ple, that the dynamics of a derived system of equations leads to behavior assumptions made in its derivation that is in compatible with the. Alternatively, a particular simplifying assumption, such as spherical sym-metry in general relativity or zero vorticity for compressible fluids, may turn out to be unstable at large coercive estimate available.22.

These and other similar situations lead to important dilemmas: should we persist in studying the approximate equations even when, in many cases, we face formidable mathematical difficulties (some which may turn out to be quite pathological and are per-haps related to the nature of the approximation), or should we abandon them in favor of the original system or a more suitable approximation?
Whatever one may feel about this in any specific situation, it is clear that the problem of understanding, rigorously, the range of validity of various approximations is one of the fundamental goals in PDEs. (iii) Devise and analyze the right equation for studying the specific geometric or physical problem at hand.last goal is equally important even though it is neces-This sarily vague. The enormously important role played by PDEs in various branches of mathematics is more evi-dent than ever.
One looks in awe at how equations such as the Laplace, heat, wave, Dirac, Kd V, Maxwell, Yang Mills, and Einstein equations, which were originally introduced in specific physical contexts, turned out to have very deep applications to seemingly unrelated problems in areas such as geometry, topology, alge - bra, and combinatorics.
Other PDEs appear naturally in geometry when we look for embedded objects with optimal geometric shapes, such as solutions to isoperi-metric problems, minimal surfaces, surfaces of least distortion or minimal curvature, or, more abstractly, connections, maps, or metrics with distinguished prop - erties. They are variational in character, just like the main equations of mathematical physics. Other equations have been introduced with the goal of allowing one to deform a general object, such as a map, connection, or metric, to an optimal one.
They usually arise in the form of geometric, parabolic flows. The most famous example of this is Ricci flow, first introduced by Richard Hamilton, who hoped to use it to deform Riemannian metrics into Einstein metrics. Sim-ilar ideas were used earlier to construct, for example, stationary harmonic maps with the help of a harmonic heat flow, and self-dual Yang–Mills connections with the help of a Yang–Mills flow.
In addition to the successful use of Ricci flow to settle the Poincaré conjecture in three dimensions, another remarkable recent example of the usefulness of geometric flows is that of the inverse mean flow, first introduced by Geroch, to settle the so-called Riemannian version of the penrose inequality.

Chicago IV.13 General Relativity and the Einstein Equations Mihalis Dafermos Einstein’s formulation of general relativity represents one of the great triumphs of modern physics and provides the currently accepted classical theory that uni-fies gravitation, inertia, and geometry. The Einstein equations are the mathematical embodiment of this theory. The definitive form of the equations, R\mu\nu - 1 2 Rg\mu\nu = 8πT\mu\nu, (1) was attained in November 1915;
this was the final act of Einstein’s eight-year struggle to generalize his principle of relativity so as to encompass gravitation, which had been described in the earlier “Newtonian” theory by the Poisson equation . artial \1 artialx2φ2 + . artial \1 artialy2φ2 + . artial \1 artialz2φ2 = 4π\mu (2) for the potentialφ and mass density \mu. (1) and the Poisson equation (2) is that the mysteri-An obvious contrast between the Einstein equations ous notation of the former makes it far less obvious what they even mean.
This has given the subject of general relativity a reputation for difficulty and impen-etr ability. However, this reputation is to some extent unwarranted. Both (1) and (2) represent the culmination of revolutionary theories whose formulations presup-pose a complicated conceptual framework. For better 483 or for worse, however, the structure necessary to for-mulate Poisson’s equation has been incorporated into our traditional mathematical notation and school edu - cation.
As a result, R3, with its Cartesian coordinate system, and notions such as functions, partial deriva - tives, masses, forces, and so on, are familiar to people with a general mathematical background, while the con-ceptual structure of general relativity is much less so, both with respect to its basic physical notions and with respect to the mathematical objects that are needed to model them.
However, once one comes to terms with these, the equations turn out to be more natural and, one might even dare say, simpler. Thus, the first task of this article is to explain in more detail the conceptual structure of general relativ - ity. Our aim will be to make it clear what the equations (1) actually denote, and, more over, why they are in a cer-tain sense the simplest equations one can write down, given the general framework of the theory.
This in turn will require us to review special relativity and its implications for the structure of matter, which will bring us to the unified concept of stress–energy–momentum, described by a Einstein in his inspired leap to the notion of a gen-tensorial object T . Finally, we will join eral four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold(M, g) that represents our space-time continuum. We shall see that equation (1) expresses a relationship between the tensor so - called T curvature and the geometry. of g as expressed in its merely knowing how to write down its governing equa - tions.
General relativity is associated with some of There is more to truly understanding a theory than the most spectacular predictions of twentieth-century physics: gravitational collapse, black holes, space-time singularities, the expansion of the universe. These phenomena (which were completely unknown in 1915 and thus played no role in the formulation of the equations (1)) revealed themselves only when the concep-tual issues surrounding the problem of global dynamics of solutions were understood.
This took a surprisingly long time, though the story is not as well-known as the heroic struggle to attain (1). The article will conclude with a very brief glimpse into the fascinating dynamics of the Einstein equations. 1 Special Relativity

However, it was Einstein’s profound insightpoincaré to elevate this invariance to the status of funda-mental physical principle, despite its in compatibility with what we now usually call which corresponds to takingc → $\infty$ Galilean relativity in (3).
A sur-, pr ising consequence of Lorentz invariance is that thenotion of simultaneity is not absolute but depends on the observer: given two distinct events that occur at(t, x, y, z) and (t, x, y, z), it is easy to find a Lorentz transformation such that the transformed events no longer have the samet-coordinate. ential equations known as theple It follows from a celebrated result in partial differ-, applied to (4), that electromagnetic disturbances in strong Huygens princi vacuum propagate with speed tify as the speed of light.

A further postulate of the principle of relativity is that physical theories should not allow massive particles to move at speeds (as measured in any frame) greater than or equal toc. 1.2 Minkowski, 1908 Einstein’s understanding of special relativity was “algebraic.” It was minkowski [VI.64](/part - 06/hermann - minkowski - 18641909) who first understood IV.
Branches of Mathematics its underlying geometric structure, namely, that the content of the principle was contained in the metric element$-c2 dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2 (5)$ defined on R4 with coordinates(t, x, y, z). We call Rand denote it4 endowed with the metric (5)R3+^1. Points of Minkowski space-time R^3^+^1 are referred to as the events inner product. The expression (5) is classical notation for defined on tangent vector sv =((c-1 v)0, v1$, v2$, v3)$, w = ((c - 1w)0$, w1$, w2$, w3) on R4 by v, w = −v0 w0 + v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3.
(6) The Lorentz transformations constitute precisely the symmetry group of the geometry defined by (5). Einstein’s principle of relativity could now be understood as the principle that the fundamental equations of physics must refer to space-time only through geometric quantities: that is, quantities that can be defined purely in terms of the metric. For example, from this point of view the reason that the notion of absolute simultaneity is not allowed is that it depends on a privileged hyperplane through any given point of R3+1.
But there are Lorentz transformations that preserve the metric and send this hyperplane to another one through the given point, so nothing in the metric can pick out one particular hyperplane. Note that if a physi-cal theory makes use of geometric quantities only, then it is automatically invariant under Lorentz transformations: this observation renders many complicated calculations unnecessary.

Indeed, even Einstein initially rejected Minkowski space-time, pre-fer ring to retain the independent reality of a definite “space,” albeit a space with a relative notion of simul-taneity. Only as a result of his search for general relativity did he realize that this view is fundamentally untenable. We shall return to this in section 3. 2 Relativistic Dynamics and the unification of Energy, Momentum, and Stress Be sides the space-time concept and its geometriza-tion, the principle of relativity led to a profound rearrangement and unification of the fundamental con-cepts of dynamics:
mass, energy, and momentum. Einstein’s celebrated relation between mass and energy inthe rest frame,

Now, General relativity has to be formulated in terms of rather than particles. As a first step toward under instead of particles we consider fic at i on of dynamical concepts encompasses what is matter fields; the uni known asied by the so-called stress, and its complete expression is embod-stress–energy–momentum tensor T . This tensor is fundamental to general relativity, so wehave no choice but to familiarize ourselves with it.
It will be the key to the form of the Einstein equations (1)as well as to the object on their right-hand side. For each point$q \in (R3)+1$, the stress–energy–momentum tensor field T gives us a map T$: R4$ q . imes (R4)q \to R (9)

By (R4)q we mean the often identify R4 with R4 q, but it will be important to dis- tinguish between the two when considering arbitrary coordinates in section 3.2.) Bilinear maps of the form (9) are known as covariant 2-tensors. known as agiven by If the only matter present is described by what is perfect fluid, then the components of$T are T00 = (ρ + p)u0u0 - p$, (T0)i = (ρ + p)uiu0$, Tij = (ρ + p)uiuj + pδij$,

Greek indices will range over 0, 1,, and where δij = 1 if i = j, 0 if i = j, and i and 2, 3. We identify T00 with energy, (T0)i with momentum, and dependent. Finally, observe that Tij with stress. These notions are clearly frame-T (u, u) = ρc2.
This is the field-theoretic version of the famous equation (8).In general, T is derived from the totality of all the matter fields by constitutive functions that depend on the nature of the matter fields and their interactions. We need not worry here about such things. But, regard less of the nature of the matter fields involved, we always postulate that the following equations are satisfied:

3.1 The Equivalence Principle

Einstein understood as early as 1907 that the most pro-found aspect of the gravitational force could not be described within the relativity principle as he had for-mulated it in 1905. This aspect is what he called the equivalence principle. ciple is that of the “test particle” with velocity a fixed gravitational field The easiest setting in which to understand this prin-φ. In this case, we have thatv(t) in the classical gravitational force is given by$f = −m \nabla φ$, and we may rewrite Newton’s second law$m(dv/dt) =f as$

d$v= −∇φ$. (12) d$t$

Notice that the mass gravitational field accelerates all objects at a given posi-$m$has dropped out! Thus, the tion in the same way. This explains the fact, recorded already in late antiquity by Ioannes Philoponus and popularized in Western Europe by Galileo, that the time it takes objects to fall from a given height is independent of their weight. It was Einstein who first interpreted this property as a sort of covariance with respect to transformations toinstance, in the case of a constant gravitational field, noninertial, that is to say accelerated, frames.
For which corresponds to the case$φ(z) = f z$, we can pass to the accelerated frame

$z$ ̃$= z + {}^{12}f t^{2}$

and write (12) as

d$v = 0$. (13)

Similarly, one can reverse the argument to “simulate” a gravitational field when none is present by expressingd$t$ (13) in an accelerated frame.

3.2 Vectors, Tensors, and Equations in

General Coordinates

Exactly what the equivalence principle means in gen-eral is some what obscure and has been the subject of debate ever since Einstein introduced it. Never the-less, the above considerations suggest that, even in the absence of gravity, it would be useful to know how various objects and equations appear when expressedin arbitrary coordinate systems.
That is to say, let us change from our Minkowski coordinates$x^{0}$, x1$, x2$, x3 to the most general coordinate system, which we shall write a$\bar{s}x^{\mu} = x$ ̄$\mu (x0$, x1, x2$, x3)$, wher. ar{e}\mu ranges over 0, 1, 2, 3.Expressing scalar functions in arbitrary coordinates poses no problem. But what about vector fields? Ifis a vector field expressed in Minkowski coordinates$v$ as coordinate$\bar{s}(v^{0}$, v1$, vx2$, v^ ̄^μ?3), how do we express v in our new ally tor field One has to think a bit about what a vector field actu-is.
The correct point of view is to consider a vec-$v$as a first-order differential operator defined (using Einstein’s summation convention) byvμ∂ f . So we seek vμ^ ̄ such that v(f ) = vμ^ ̄∂ fv(f )for all= functions\mu f. The chain rule then gives us our answer:$\mu v^{\mu} = \partial 1artialxx$ ̄ ̄$\mu^{\nu} v^{\nu}$. (14)

by formally applying the chain rule to $\bar{d}x^{\mu}$. sides There is another covariant symmetric 2-tensor be-T that is relevant here. This is the Minkowski met- ric itself. Indeed, the classical form of the minkowski metric (5) corresponds to the representation

Einstein (always thinking “algebraically”) was seeking laws of motion for both matter and the gravitational field that would have the same form in all coordinate systems.
As he understood it, this meant that all objects that appear should transform as tensors and should be considered a priori “unknown.” Hereferred to this principle as “general covariance.” This suggests that metric 2-tensor. Let us call this 2-tensorη should be replaced by an unknowng. One can ofsym- course try to write down an equation for the “unknown”$g$that forces it to be the “known” Minkowski metricη. Thus, “general covariance” per se does not force one toabandonη.
But in view of the fact that g and T have the same number of components, it was a natural stepto con side rg as the embodiment of the gravitational field and to try to look for an equation that related and T directly. In this way, the framework of gener alg relativity was born.

3.3 Lorentzian Geometry

The profound insight of replacing the fixed Minkowskiη with a dynamic g brought Einstein to what we now callalizes Minkowski geometry following the blueprint of Lorentzian geometry. Lorentzian geometry gener riemann [VI.49]. That is, we replace the Minkowski metricη by a general mapg$: R4$ q . imes  (R4)q \to  R.

In other words, we replace2-tensor, which is expressed in arbitrary coordinatesη by a symmetric covariantx^\mu byg^μν dx^\mu dx^ν.

More over, we require that at each point ear formg(· , ·) can be diagonalized to the Minkowskiq the bilin-$form (6)$. Loosely speaking, a Lorentzian metric is one that “looks locally like the Minkowski metric,” just as a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) looks locally like the Euclidean metric.
Just as with the Minkowski metric, the bilinear form gas permits us to classify nonzero vectors timelike, null, or spacelike and to define proper time svq at a point q of world lines the formula (7), but with$γ(s) = (x0γ$ ̇(s)$, x, γ̇ \text{replaced by}1(s)$, x2(s), xg3(s))x ̇\mu x ̇byν . It is in this sense that we can speak of the geometryμν$of$ g.
In view of Minkowski’s formulation of the special relativity principle as the statement that the equationsof physics refer to space-time only through geometric quantities associated with the Minkowski metric, itis natural to look for a generalization of this principle, and indeed a suitable version immediately suggests itself. It is the principle that refer to the space-time coordinates only via geometric the equations of physics quantities naturally associated withg.
“test particles,” as formulated geometrically for the We saw earlier that the kinematic constraint on Minkowski metric, was that dthis makes sense for an arbitrary Lorentzian metric.γ/ds should be timelike; But how does one formulate differential equations? For instance, how does one formulate an analogue of (10) that refers only to$g$? natural geometric concepts suitable for the task had It turned out that in the Riemannian case, a set of already been developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by Riemann, Bianchi, Christoffel, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.
These carry over directly to the Lorentzian case.

bols One begins by defining the so-calledΓμν. ambda by Christoffel symΓμνλ =1 2 gλρ(∂\mu gρν + ∂νgμρ - ∂ρgμν ). Here, the numbersgμν are the components of the “inverse metric” oftion to the equation$g$: that is, they are the unique solu-$g^{\mu}\nu g = δ^{\mu}$, where, as usual,δμ λ = 1 if λ = \mu and 0 otherwise.
(It turns out thatνλ. ambda gμν is very useful for the calculational gymnastics that are typical of tensor analysis when it exploits the einstein summation convention.) One can then define a differential operator$\nabla^{\mu} called$ a connection, which acts on vector fields by . abla\mu vν = ∂\mu vν + Γμλν vλ (16) and on covariant 2-tensors by . abla. ambda T\mu\nu = . artial. ambda T\mu\nu - Γλ\muσ Tσ \nu - Γλ\nuσ T\muσ. (17) The left-hand sides of (16) and (17) define tensors that can be expressed in any coordinate system by a formal application of the chain rule.
With the help of this differential operator, one could now write the analogue of equations (10) for an arbi-trary metric g as . abla\mu T\mu\nu = 0, (18)

wherewithg.. ablaμ = gμν. ablaν refers to the connection associated If we consider a limit as the matter field becomes concentrated at a point, or rather as the stress–energy–momentum tensor T is nonzero only on a world line, then this curve will be aμν geodesic of g: that is, a curve that locally maximizes the proper time defined byg. These are the analogues of straight timelike lines in Minkowski space. In this limit, the motion of the matter does not depend on the nature of the stressenergy–momentum tensor, but only on the geometry of the metric that defines geodesics.
Thus, all objects fall in the same way. These considerations give a concrete realization to the equivalence principle in general relativity. Finally, it is important to remark that for a general metric vation laws (11) for “total energy” and “total momen-g, the identity (18) does not imply global conser- tum.” Such laws hold only ifg has symmetries. The fact that the fundamental conservation laws survive in general only at the infinitesimal level is an important insight into the nature of these principles in physics.

3.4 Curvature and the Einstein Equations

It remains, then, to give a set of equations for the metric gwe expect these equations to be second order, and wethat relate it to T . In anticipation of a Newtonian limit, expect them to implement “general covariance” in the simplest way possible: they should refer to no other structure butg itself and T . tensorial objects that are invariantly associated with One can define the Again, Riemannian geometry provides ready-made Riemann curvature tensor$g$.Rμνλρ dx\mu dxν dx. ambda dxρ

Thus, the “local strength” of gravitational fields in vacuum regions is related in the Newtonian limit to the tidal forces on macroscopic test matter, not the norm of the gravitational force. 489 3.5 The Manifold Concept We have been able to get this far with out really addressing the question of passing from the Minkowski metric to a general where the metric gis defined. Ing, Einstein did not originally have in mind replacing the domain R4.
But it is clear in the Riemannian case from the theory of surfaces that the natural object for a metric to live on is not necessarily R2 but a general surface.
 For instance, the metric dur ally lives on the sphere S2. In saying this, we areθ2 + . in θ dφ2 nat-to understand that one requires several coordinate systems of the type(θ, φ) to cover all of S2. The n - dimensional generalization of the object where Rie-mannian or Lorentzian metrics naturally live is a manifoldby consistently smoothly pasting together local coordi-[I.3 §6.9](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions).
Manifolds are the structures obtained nate systems. Thus, general relativity allows the space-time continuum not to be R4 but instead to be a general manifold a le nt to M, which may very well be topologically inequiv - R4, just as S2 is in equivalent to R2. We call the pair(M, g) a Lorentzian manifold. Properly put, the unknown in the Einstein equations is not just pair(M, g). g but the It is interesting that this fundamental fact, namely that the topology of space-time is not a priori de-termined by the equations, arises almost as an afterthought.
More over, it was a thought that took many years to be clarified. 3.6 Waves, Gauges, and Hyperbolicity When written out explicitly in arbitrary coordinates(try it!), the Einstein equations do not appear to be of any usual type, such as elliptic (like equation [IV.12 §1](/part - 04/analysis)), parabolic (like the heat equa-the poisson tion[I.3 §5.4](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions); see [IV.12 §2.5](/part - 04/analysis) for more about these differ-[I.3 §5.4](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions)), or hyperbolic (like the wave equation ent classes of PDEs).
This is related to the fact that, given a solution, one can form a “new” solution by composing the old solution with a coordinate transforma - tion. We can do this for new coordinate systems whose coordinate transformations differ from the identity only in a ball.
This fact, known as the confused Einstein and his mathematical collaborator hole argument, Marcel Grossmann, who were thinking algebraically in terms of the form of the equations in coordinates, and temporarily led them to reject “general covariance.” The resulting backtracking delayed the final correct formulation of (1) by about two years. The geometric 490 interpretation of the theory immediately suggests there solution to the dilemma: such solutions are to be considered “the same” because they are the same from the point of view of all geometric measurements.
In modern language, a solution to the Einstein vacuum equa - tions (say) is an equivalence class [I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar) of space times(M, g), where two space-times are equivalent if there exists a diffeomorphism that in any open set the metric has the same coordinateφ between them such form when one identifies local coordinates byφ. over come, the Einstein equations can be viewed as hyperbolic. The easiest way to do this is to impose a It turns out that once these conceptual issues are gaugedinate system. Specifically, one requires the coordinate:
that is to say, a certain restriction on the coor functionsxα to satisfy the wave equationg xα = 0, where the formula d’Alembertian operator is defined by the g = . qrt{-1} g . artial\mu( -gg\mu\nu . artial\nu).

Such coordinates always exist locally and they are tradi-tion ally called harmonic coordinates, although the term wave coordinates would perhaps be more appropriate. The Einstein equation can then be written as a system

ggμν = Nμν ({gαβ}$, {\partial^{γ} g^{α}β})$,

where in the N∂γ μνgαβis a nonlinear expression that is quadratic. In view of the Lorentzian signature of the metric, the above system constitutes what is known as a second-order nonlinear (but quasilinear) hyperbolic system At this point, it is instructive to make a com par i-. son with the Maxwell equations. Suppose we are given an electric field Minkowski space. A 4$E$and a magnetic field-potential is a vector field Bdefined on A such that(Here Ei = −=∂1, andi A0 - c-1∂tis totally antisymmetric, i.e., it Ai$, \text{and Bi} = 3 j$, k=1 ijk∂j Ak.

the Maxwell equations can be written

from which the wave properties are completely man-ifest. The gauge-symmetric point of view lived on to later twentieth century glory: the which are a nonlinear generalization of the Maxwell Yang–Mills equations, equations with a similar gauge symmetry, are the cen-tral part of the so-called standard model for particle physics. The hyperbolicity property of the Einstein equations has two important repercussions. The first is that there should exist gravitational waves.
This was noted by Einstein at least as early as 1918, essentially as a result ofa linearized version of the considerations in the above discussion. The second is that there is a initial value problem [IV.12 §2.4](/part-04/analysis) for the einstein well-posed equations (1) with the domain-of-dependence prop-erty, when these are coupled with appropriate matter equations. In particular, this is true in the vacuum case (21).
The proper conceptual framework to formulate the latter problem took a long time to get right, and was only completely understood through work of Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch in the 1950 s and 1960 s, based on the fundamental concept of global hyperbolicity could associate a unique solution (in the vacuum case, due to Leray. Well-posedness means that one a Lorentzian 4 - manifold(M, g) satisfying (21)) with a suitable notion of initial data. Of course, “initial data”does not mean “data at time$t =$0,” since the concept of t = 0 is not geometric.
Instead, the data take the form of some Riemannian 3-manifold covariant 2-tensor K. The triple(Σ,(Σ, g) ̄g, K) ̄with a symmetric has to satisfy the so-called notion, the fundamental problem of general relativity, Einstein constraint equations. But with this despite its revolutionary conceptual structure, is thor-oughly classical: to determine the relation of the solution to initial data, that is to say, to determine the future from knowledge of the “present.” This is the problem of dynamics.
4 The Dynamics of General Relativity In this final section we give a taste of our current math-ematical understanding of the dynamics of the Einstein equations.

4.1 Stability of Minkowski Space and the

Nonlinearity of Gravitational Radiation

In any physical theory in which one can formulate the problem of dynamics, the most basic question is the

IV.13. General Relativity and the Einstein Equations stability of the trivial solution. In other words, if wemake a small change to the “initial conditions,” will the resulting change to the solution be small as well? In the case of general relativity, this is the question of stability of the Minkowski space-time R3$+1$. This fund a men- tal result was proven for the vacuum equations (21) in1993 by Christodoulou and Klainerman. it possible to formulate theation The proof of the stability of Minkowski space made rigorously.
Gravitational radiation is yet to belaws of gravitational rad i observed directly, but it has been inferred, originally by Hulse and Taylor, from the energy loss of a binary system. This work gave them the only Nobel prize (1993) directly associated with the Einstein equations!The blueprint for the mathematical formulation of the radiation problem is based on work of Bondi and later Penrose. One associates with the space-time(M, g) an ideal boundary “at infinity,” known as denoted I+.
Physically, the points ofnull infinity I+ correspond and to observers who are far away from the isolated self-gravitating system but who are receiving its signals. Gravitational radiation can be identified with certain tensors defined on I+ from rescaled boundary limits of various geometric quantities. As Christodoulou was todiscover, the laws of gravitational radiation are themselves nonlinear, and the nonlinearity is potentially relevant for observation.

4.2 Black Holes

Perhaps no prediction of general relativity is better known today than that of black holes. The story of black holes begins with the so-called Schwarzschild metric:

- 1 - 2 rm dt2 + 1 - 2 rm-1 dr2+ r2(dθ2 + . in2 θ dφ2). (22) The parametera solution of the vacuum Einstein equations (21) thatm here is a positive constant. This is was found in 1916. The original interpretation of (22) was that it modeled the gravitational field in a vacuum region out side a star. That is to say, (22) was considered only in some coordinate range and the metric was matched atr > Rr = R0, for anto a “static” inte- R0 > 2 m, rior metric satisfying the coupled Einstein–Euler sys-tem in the coordinate range$r$ ⩽ R .

What(r , t) coordinates, the metric element appears to be singular. But this turns out to be an illusion! By a simple change of coordinates, one can easily extend the metric reg-ularly as a solution of (21) beyond r = 2 m.
That is, there exists a manifold M that contains both a re gionr >ular (null) hypersurface2 m and a region 0 < r <H+. The metric element (22)2 m, separated by a reg- is valid every where except on H+, where it must be rewritten in regular coordinates. It turns out that the hypersurface H+ can be char- acterized by an exceptional global property: it defines the boundary of the region of space-time that can send signals to null infinity I+, or, in the physical interpreta- tion, to distant observers.
In general, the set of points that cannot send signals to null infinity I+ is known as the0< r <black hole2 m is the black hole region of region of space-time. Thus, the region M, and H+ is known as the These issues took a long time to be sorted out, event horizon. partly because the language of global Lorentzian geom-etry was developed long after the original formulation of the Einstein equations. The global geometry ofthe extended space-time$M$was clarified by Synge in around 1950 and finally by Kruskal in 1960. The name“black hole” is due to the imaginative physicist John Wheeler.
From their beginnings as a theoretical curios-ity, black holes have become part of the accepted astrophysical explanation for a wide variety of phenomena, and in particular are thought to represent the end-state for the gravitational collapse of many stars.

4.3 Space-Time Singularities

A second natural problem poses itself in relation tothe Schwarzschild metric (22), now considered in the region happens at$r <r2 = m$0?of the extended space-time$M$: what scalar geometric invariant, it follows that, unlike the situation A computation reveals that as RμνλρRμνλρ blows up. Since this expression is ar \to  0, the Kretchmann$at$ r = 2 m, the space-time is not regularly extendable beyond 0.
More over, timelike geodesics (freely falling observers in the test particle approximation) entering the black hole region reach$r =$0 in finite proper time, so they are “incomplete” in the sense that they cannot be continued indefinitely. They thus “observe” the breakdown of the geometry of the space-time metric. More over, macroscopic observers approaching$r = 0$ are torn apart by the gravitational “tidal forces.”

this seemingly pathological behavior was connected tothe high degree of symmetry of the Schwarzschild met-In the early years of the subject, it was thought that ric and that “generic” solutions would not exhibit such phenomena. That this is not the case was shown by Penrose’s celebrated states that solutions to the initial value problem for incompleteness theorem of 1965. This the Einstein equations coupled to appropriate matter will geodesics if the initial data hypersurface is noncom-always contain such incomplete timelike or null pact and contains what is known as a closed trapped surface.
The Schwarzschild case may appear to suggest that such incomplete geodesics are associated with the curvature blowing up. However, the situation can infact be very different, as is apparent in the celebrated kerr solutions to the vacuum equations (21), discovered only solutions, a remarkable two-parameter family of in 1963, which are rotating versions of (22). In the Kerr solutions, incomplete timelike geodesics meet aso-called Cauchy horizon, a smooth boundary of the region of space-time that is uniquely determined by initial data.
The theorem of Penrose gives rise to two important conjectures. The first, known asship, says roughly that for generic physically plausi-weak cosmic cens or ble initial data for suitable Einstein-matter systems, geodesic incompleteness, if it occurs, is always confined to black hole regions. The second, strong cosmic censorship si ble initial data, incompleteness of the solution is, says roughly that for generic admisalways associated with a local obstruction to extend - ability, such as the blow-up of curvature.
The latter conjecture would ensure that the unique solution of the initial value problem is the only classical space-time that can arise from the data. That is to say, it would imply that classical determinism holds for the Einstein equations. Both conjectures are false if we drop the assumption that the initial data are generic, and this is one rea-son for their difficulty. Indeed, Christodoulou has constructed spherically symmetric solutions of the cou-pled Einstein-scalar field system (arising from regular initial data) that are geodesically incomplete but do not contain black hole regions.
Such space-times are said to contain naked singularities. not require that they arise from the collapse of regu-lar initial data. An example is the Schwarzschild metric Naked singularities are easy to construct if one does (22) for complete asymptotically flat Cauchy hypersurface. Thism < 0. This metric, however, does not admit a IV. Branches of Mathematics fact is related to the celebrated of Schoen and Yau. positive energy theorem 4.4 Cosmology The space - times(M, g) discussed previously are all idealized representations of isolated systems.
The “restof the universe” is excised and replaced by an “asymptotically flat end”; far-away observers are placed at an ideal boundary “at infinity.” But what if we are more ambitious and consider our space - time(M, g) as rep- re sent ing the whole universe? The study of this latter problem is known as cosmology. Observations suggest that on very large scales the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. This is some times known as the Copernican principle. Interestingly, one cannot solve the Poisson equation (2)with a constant. abla φ and constant nonzero \mu on R4.
Thus, in Newtonian physics, cosmology never became a rational science.1 General relativity, on the other hand, does admit homogeneous and isotropic solutions aswell as their perturbations. Indeed, cosmological solutions of the Einstein equations were studied by einstein himself, de Sitter, Friedmann, and Lemaitre in the early years of the subject. When general relativity was formulated, the prevailing view was that the universe should be static. This led Einstein to add a termside of his equations, fine-tuned so as to allow forΛg\mu\nu to the left - hand such a solution.

Expanding universes can be modeled to a first approximation by so-called Friedmann–Lemaitre solutions to the Einstein–Euler system, with various values ofΛ. In the past direction, these solutions are singular:
this singu-lar behavior is often given the suggestive name “the big bang.” 4.5 Future Developments The plethora of exact solutions of the Einstein equa-tions gives us a taste of what the qualitative behavior of more general solutions may be. But a true qualita-tive understanding of the nature of general solutions has been achieved only in a neighborhood of the very da tions of the Newtonian theory so as to describe the theory with anonmetric connection on, say,1. One can study “Newtonian cosmology” by modifying the foun - T3$\times R$.

The question of the stability of the black hole solutions described above remains unanswered, as do the cosmic censorship conjectures andthe nature of the singularities that occur generically in general relativity.

Problems con-cerning the singular behavior of nonlinear hyperbolic How likely is it that these questions can ever be partial differential equations are notoriously difficult. The rich geometric structure of the Einstein equations appears at first as a formidable additional complication, but it may also turn out to be a blessing. One can only hope that the Einstein equations will continue to reveal beautiful mathematical structure that answers fundamental questions about our physical world.

as well as reaction chemistry, population dynamics, and economics. Computer simulations and visualizations play an important role in the development of the theory; they have changed our views about what should be considered typical, rather than special and a typical. There are two main branches of dynamical systems: continuous and discrete. The main focus of this paper will be holomorphic dynamics, which concerns discrete dynamical systems of a special kind.

Newton’s idea was to define a new function: Nf (x) = x - ff (x)^ (x). To put this more geometrically, N (x) is the x - coordi - f nate of the point where the tangent line to the graphy = f (x) at the point (x, f (x)) crosses the x - axis.

And this is true:

A solution is called an orbit or trajectory, and is parametrized by a numbert, which one usually thinks of as time, that takes real values and varies continuously: hence the name “continuous” dynamical system. A periodic orbit of period T is a solution that repeats itself after time T, but not earlier.

The differential equationx^ (t) = −x(t) is of sec- ond order, but it is nevertheless a continuous dynamical system because it is equivalent to the system oftwo first-order differential equations$x (t) = x (t) andx^{2}(t) = −x^{1}(t)$.

1.4 Stability

The modern theory of dynamics was greatly influenced by the work of poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912), and in particular by his prize-winning memoir on the three-body problem, succeeded by three more elaborate volumes on celestial mechanics, all from the late nineteenth century. The memoir was written in response to a competition where one of the proposed problems concerned stability of the solar system. Poincaré introduced the so-called restricted three-body problem, where the third body is assumed to have an infinitely small mass:
it does not influence the motion of the other two bodies but it is 495 influenced by them. Poincaré’s work became the pre-lude to topological dynamics, which focuses on topological properties of solutions to dynamical systems and takes a qualitative approach to them. tem.

Let us illustrate this by two linear examples in discrete dynamics. For the real function F(x) = −x, all points have a periodic orbit: 0 has period 1 and all other xhave period 2. Every orbit is stable, but none is asymp-totically stable. The real function G(x) =1 x has only one periodic orbit, namely 0. Since has period 1, and we call it a fixed point G(0) =. If you take20, this orbit any number and repeatedly divide it 2, then the result-ing sequence will approach 0, so the fixed point 0 is asymptotically stable.
One of the methods introduced by Poincaré during his study of the three-body problem was a reduction from a continuous dynamical system, in dimensionn, say, to an associated discrete dynamical system, a map-ping in dimensionn - 1. The idea is as follows. Sup- pose we have a periodic orbit of period continuous system. Choose a pointx on the orbit and T > 0 in some a hypersurface hyperplane, such that the orbit cuts throughΣ through x0, for instance part of a0 Σ at x . For any point inΣthat is sufficiently close tox0, one0 can follow its orbit around and see where it next inter-sectsΣ.
This defines a transformation, known as the Poincaré map, which takes the original point to the next point of intersection of its orbit withlows from the fact that dynamical systems have uniqueΣ. It fol- solutions that every Poincaré map is injective in the neighborhood ofmap is defined. One can perform both forwards and$x^{0} (within Σ$) for which the Poincaré backwards iterations.
Note that the periodic orbit of $x$asymptotically stable) exactly when the fixed point0 in the continuous system is stable (respectively, x0 of the Poincaré map in the discrete system is stable (respectively, asymptotically stable).

1.5 Chaotic Behavior

The notion ofhas been used in different settings, and there is no sin-chaotic dynamics arose in the 1970 s. It gle definition that covers all uses of the term. However, the property that best characterizes chaos is the phe-nomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Poincaré was the first to observe sensitivity to initial conditions in his treatment of the three-body problem. Instead of describing his observations let us look at a much simpler example from discrete dynamics. Take as a dynamical space X the half-open unit inter- valber and reduces it modulo 1. That is,[0, 1), and let F be the function that doubles a num-F(x) = 2 x when0 be a number in⩽ x <1 2 and F(x)X and let its iterates be = 2 x - 1 whe(n1)2 ⩽ x <x = 1. Let F(xx)0, x(2 k)2 x=.

In practical applications this is never the case.
For instance, when applying a mathematical model to perform weather forecasts, one does not know the initial conditions exactly, and this is why reliable long-term forecasting is impossible.

strange attractors Sensitivity is also important in the notion of so-called. A set A is called an attractor if all orbits that start innearby points get closer and closer to A stay in A and if all orbits through A. In continuous systems, some simple sets that can be attractors are equilibrium points, periodic orbits (limit cycles), and surfaces such as a torus. In contrast to these examples, strange attractors have both complicated geometry and complicated dynamics: the geometry isdynamics sensitive. We shall see examples of fractals fractal and the later on.
tract or The best-known strange attractor is the. In the early 1960 s, the meteorologist Edward N.Lorenz at Lorenz studied a three-dimensional continuous dynam-ical system that gave a simplified model of heat flow. While doing so, he noticed that if he restarted his com-puter with its initial conditions chosen as the output of an earlier calculation, then the trajectory started to diverge from the one he had previously observed. The explanation he found was that the computer used more precision in its internal calculations than it showed in its output.
For this reason, it was not immediately apparent that the initial conditions were in fact very slightly different from before. Because the system was sensitive, this tiny difference eventually made a much bigger difference. He coined the poetic phrase “the but-terfly effect” to describe this phenomenon, suggesting that a small disturbance such as a butterfly flickering its wings could in time have a dramatic effect on the longterm evolution of the weather and trigger a to rna do thousands of miles away.
Computer simulations of the Lorenz system indicate that solutions are attracted toa complicated set that “looks like” a strange attractor. The question of whether it actually was one remained open for a long time. It is not obvious how trustworthy computer simulations are when one is studying sensitive systems, since the computer rounds off the numbers in each step. In 1998 Warwick Tucker gavea computer-assisted proof that the Lorenz attractor is in fact a strange attractor. He used met ic, where numbers are represented by intervals and interval a ri th estimates can be made precise.
For topological reasons, sensitivity to initial conditions is possible for continuous dynamical systems only when the dimension is at least 3. For discrete systems where the map must be at least 2. However, for noninjective mappings, F is injective, the dimension sensitivity can occur for one-dimensional systems, aswe saw with the example given earlier. This is one of

the reasons that discrete one-dimensional dynamical systems have been intensively studied.

1.6 Structural Stability

Two dynamical systems are said to be equivalent if there is a homeomorphism (a continuous topologically map with continuous inverse) that maps the orbits of one system onto the orbits of the other, and vice versa. Roughly speaking, this means that there is a continuous change of variables that turns one system into the other. tem given by the real quadratic polynomial4 x(As an example, consider the discrete dynamical sys-1 - x). Suppose we were to make the substitution F(x) =y = −4 x + 2. How could we describe the system in terms of4 x(1 - x)y, which means that?
Well, if we applyy F= −, then we change4 x+2 changes F(x)x to to-4 F(x) + 2 = −16 x(1 - x) + 2. But - 16 x(1 - x) + 2 = 16 x2 - 16 x + 2= (-4 x + 2)2 - 2 = y2 - 2. Therefore, the effect of applying the polynomial func - tion F to xis to apply a different polynomial function toy, namely Q(y) = y2 - 2.
Since the change of vari- ables fromx to - 4 x + 2 is continuous and invertible, one says that the functions Because F and Q are conjugate, the orbit of any F and Q are conjugate.xthe orbit of the corresponding point0 under F becomes, after the change of variables, y = −4 x + 2 under two systems are topologically equivalent: if you want to Q. That is, for every k we have yk = −0 4 xk + 2.
The0 understand the dynamics of one of them, you can if you study the other, since its dynamics will be qualitatively the same. For continuous dynamical systems the notion of equivalence is slightly looser in that we allow a homeo-morphism between two topologically equivalent systems to map one orbit onto another with out respect-ing the exact time evolution, but for discrete dynamical systems we must demand that the time evolution isrespected as in the example above: in other words, we insist on conjugacy. Smale in the 1960 s and has taken off since then.
Smale evolved the theory of The term dynamical system robust systems, also named was coined by stephen structurally stable the 1930 s by Alexander A. Andronov and Lev S. Pon - systems, a notion that was introduced in tryagin. A dynamical system is called structurally sta-ble if all systems sufficiently close to it, belonging to 497 some specified family of systems, are in fact topolog-ically equivalent to it. We say that they all have the same qualitative behavior. An example of the kind of family one might consider is the set of all real quadratic polynomials of the formx2 + a.
This family is parametrized by polynomialx2 + aa, and the systems close to a given are all the polynomials x2 + a for which of structural stability when we discuss holomorphica is close to0 a0. We shall return to the question dynamics later. If a family of dynamical systems parametrized by a variable a is not structurally stable, it may still be that the system with parameter a le nt to all systems with parametera0 is topologically equiv-a in some region that contains a0.
A major goal of research into dynam- ics is to understand not just the qualitative structureof each system in the family, but also the structure of the such regions of stability. The boundaries that separate parameter space, that is, how it is divided up into these regions form what is called theifa0 belongs to this set, then there will be parameters bifurcation set:
a system has a different qualitative behavior.arbitrarily close toa0 for which the corresponding systems and a classification of possible bifurcations is A description and classification of structurally stable not within reach for general dynamical systems. How - ever, one of the success stories in the subject, holomorphic dynamics, studies a special class of dynamical systems for which many of these goals have been attained. It is time to turn our attention to this class.
2 Holomorphic Dynamics Holomorphic dynamics is the study of discrete dynam-ical systems where the map to be iterated is a holomorphic function[I.3 §1.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). Complex numbers are typically denoted by[I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) of the complex number sz.
In this article, we shall consider iterations of complex polynomials and rational functions (that is, functions like(z2 + 1)/(z3 + 1) that are ratios of polynomials), but much of what we shall say about them is true for more general holomorphic functions, such as exponential [III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions) and trigonometric [III.92](/part-03/trigonometric-functions) functions. of dynamical system, there will be tools that are spe-Whenever one restricts attention to a special kind cially adapted to that situation.
In holomorphic dynam-ics these tools come from complex analysis. When we concentrate on rational functions, there are more special tools, and if we restrict further to polynomials, then there are yet others, as we shall see.

functions? One answer arose in 1879, when Why might one be interested in iterating rational cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) had the idea of trying to find roots of complex polynomials by extending Newton’s method, which we discussed in the introduction, from real numbers to complex numbers. Given any polynomial P , the corre- sponding Newton function given by the formula NP is a rational function$, NP (z) = z - PP (z) (z) = z P (z)P (z)- P (z)$. To apply Newton’s method, one iterates this rational function.
The study of the iteration of rational functions flourished at the beginning of the twentieth century, thanks in particular to work of Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia (who independently obtained many of the same results). Part of their work concerned the study of the local behavior of functions in the neighborhoods of a fixed point. But they were also concerned about global dynamical properties and were inspired by the theory of so-called li shed by Paul Montel.
However, research on holomor-normal families, then recently estabphic dynamics almost came to a stop around 1930, because the fractal sets that lay behind the results wereso complicated as to be almost beyond imagination. The research came back to life in around 1980 with the vastly extended calculating powers of computers, and in particular the possibility of making sophisticated graphic visualizations of these fractal sets. Since then, holomorphic dynamics has attracted a lot of attention. New techniques continue to be developed and introduced.
simplest of polynomials, namely To set the scene, let us start by looking at one of the$z2.$2.1 The Quadratic Polynomialz2

The dynamics of the simplest quadratic polynomial,$Q (z) = z2$, plays a fundamental role in the under- standing of the dynamics of any quadratic polyno-mial. More over, the dynamical behavior of0 Q can be analyzed and understood completely. Ifz = r ei^θ, then z2 = r2 e2 i^θ, so squaring a complex number squares its modulus and doubles its argument. Therefore, the unit circle (the set of complex numbers of modulus 1) is mapped byof radiu sr < 1 is mapped onto a circle closer to the Q0 to itself, while a circle origin, and a circle of radiu sr > 1 is mapped onto a circle farther away.

A typical point in the circle, ep ar a me tr iz ed by its argument Let us look more closely at what happens to theθ, which we can take t(oi)θ, can be lie in the intervalwe obtain e2 iθ, which is parametrized by the number[0, 2π). When we square this number,2 that the argument, 2θ if 2θ < 2π, but if 2θ -θ ⩾2π2, still lies inπ, then we subtract 2[0, 2π). This isπ so strongly reminiscent of the dynamical system we considered in section 1.5. In fact, if we replace the argu - mentθ byits modified argumentθ/2π, which amounts to writing ethe same system.
Therefore, the behavior of2πi θ instead of (ei)θ, then it becomes exactlyz2 on the unit circle is chaotic. asymptotically stable fixed point, point As for the rest of the complex plane, the origin is anz inside the unit circle the iterates Q0(0) =z 0. For any converge to 0 asunit circle the distance0 ktends to infinity. For any point|z | between the iteratesz0 out side thek z and the origin tends to infinity asset of initial pointsz0 with bounded orbit is equal tok ktends to infinity.
The k the closed unit disk, i.e., all points for which Its boundary, the unit circle, divides the complex plane$|z^{0}| ⩽ 1$. into two domains with qualitatively different dynamical behavior. Some orbits of Q0 are periodic. In order to deter- mine which ones, we first notice that the only possi-bility out side the unit circle is the fixed point at the origin, since all other points, when you repeatedly square them, either get steadily closer and closer to the ori-gin, or get steadily farther and farther away.
So now let us look at the unit circle, and consider the pointe2(πi()θ){0}, with modified argumentθ . If this point is peri- odic with period that is,(2 k - 1)θ kmust be an integer. Because of this,, we must have (20)kθ0 = θ0(mod 1): it is convenient to parametrize a point on the unit circle by its modified argument. From now on, when we say0 “the pointθ,” we shall mean the point e2$πi^{θ}$, and when we say “argument” we shall mean modified argument. odic with period follows that there is one point of period 1, namely We have just established that the pointk only if (2 k - 1)θ is an integer.
Itθ is peri-θone orbit, namely0 = 0. There are two points of period 2, forming1 \to 2 \to 1. There are six points for period 3, forming two orbits, namely and 3$\to 6 \to 5 \to 3 3$.

The points of period 4 are fractions with denominator 15, but the converseis not true: the fractions 3$=1 and6 = 2 \text{have the}$ lower period 2. The periodic points on the unit circle15 3 15 3 IV.14. Dynamics are close to any point is a periodic point.
This follows dense in the unit circle, meaning that arbitrarily from the observation that all repeating binary expansions, such as 0 periodic, and any finite sequence of 0 s and 1 s is the$.1,100,011,000,110,001,100,011,000 . . . are$ start of a repeating sequence. One can, in fact, show that the periodic points on the unit circle are exactly the points whose argument is a fraction withq odd.

odic point, so the initial point is pre - periodic. Points with rational argument in[0, 1)have a finite orbit, while points with irrational argument have an infinite orbit. The reason for taking modified arguments is now justified: the behavior of the dynamics depends on whetherθ0 is rational or irrational. dense inif one considers binary expansions. For instance, a very Whenθ[00, is irrational its orbit may or may not be1).
This is another fact that is easy to see special example of aθ0 with a dense orbit is given by the binary expansionθ0 = 0.0\,100\,011\,011\,000\,001\,010\,011\,100\,101\,110\,111 . . . , where one obtains this expansion by simply listing all finite binary sequences in turn: first the blocks of length one, 0 and 1, then the blocks of length two, 00, 01, 10, and 11, and so on. When we iterate, this binary expansion shifts to the left and all possible finite sequences appear at some time or another at the beginning of some iterateθk.

2.2 Character ization of Periodic Points

Letdo the iterates of points nearz0 be a fixed point of a holomorphic mapzbehave? The answer F. How depends crucially on a number of the fixed point, which is defined to beρ0, called the F^ (zmul tip lier). To see why this is relevant, notice that ifthen F(z)is, to a first-order approximation, equal toz is very close to0 z0, F(zyou apply0) + F^ (z F0 to a point near)(z - z0) = z0 z+, its difference from$ρ(z - z0)$. Thus, whenz approximately multiplies by points will get closer to$z^{0}$, in which caseρ0. If |ρ| < 1, then nearbyz0 is called0 anvery quickly and attracting fixed point.
Ifz is called super-attractingρ = 0, then this happens. If |ρ| > 1, then nearby points get farther away and repelling. Finally, if0|ρ| = 1, then one says thatz0 is call edz is indifferent. form Ifzρ0 is indifferent, then its multiplier will take the= (e2()π){i}θ, and near z0 the map F will be approx-

It follows from the chain rule that (Fk)^ (z0) =k j -=1 0 F^ (zj) and therefore that the derivative of Fk is the same at all points of the periodic orbit. This formula also implies that a super-attracting periodic orbit must contain a critical point (that is, a point where the derivative ofis zero): if(Fk)^ (z ) = 0, then at least one F^ (z ) must F0 j be 0.Note that 0 is a super-attracting fixed point of Q0, and that any periodic orbit ofunit circle has multiplier 2 k. All periodic orbits on the Q0 of period k on the unit circle are therefore repelling.
2.3 A One-Parameter Family of Quadratic Polynomials The quadratic polynomial Q0 sits at the center of the one-parameter family of quadratic polynomials of the form Q (z) = z2 + c. (We considered this family ear - c lier, but then For each fixed complex num berz and c were real rather than complex.)c we are interested in the dynamics of the polynomial Q under iteration. Thec reason we do not need to study more general quadratic polynomials is that they can be brought into this formby a simple substitutionw = az + b, similar to the substitution in the real example in section 1.6.
For any given quadratic polynomial Pwe can find exactly one sub st it ut io nw = az + b and one c such thata(P (z)) + b = (az + b)2 + c for all z. Therefore, if we understand the dynamics of the poly - nomials Q , then we understand the dynamics of allc quadratic polynomials. There are other representative families of quadratic polynomials that can be useful. One example is the family$F (z) = \lambda z + z2$. The substitution w = z + 1. ambda changes return to the expression of. ambda F. ambda into Qc, wherec in terms ofc = 1 2λ -1 4λλ2. We shall later on.
In2 the family of polynomials coincides with the only critical value$Qc$, the parameterof Qcin the plane: c = Qc(0)

as we shall see later, critical orbits play an essential role in the analysis of the global dynamics. In the fam-ily of polynomials F the parameter . ambda is equal to the multiplier of the fixed point at the origin of$\lambda F^{λ}$, which some times makes this family more convenient.

2.4 The Riemann Sphere

To understand further the dynamics of polynomials it is best to regard them as a special case of rational functions. Since a rational function can some times be infinite, the natural space to consider is not the com-plex plane C but the extended complex plane, which is the complex plane together with the point “space is denoted ˆC= C ∪ {$\infty$}. A geometrical picture. nfty.” This (see figure 1) is obtained by identifying the extended complex plane with the Riemann sphere. This is simply the unit sphere\\{(x1}$, x2$, x3)$:\\$(x2)1 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 = 1 in three-dimensional space.
Given a number complex plane, the straight line join i ngz to the northz in the pole N = (0, 0, 1) intersects this sphere in exactly one place (apart from N itself). This place is the point in the sphere that is associated with bigger|z| is, the closer the associated point is toz. Notice that the N. We therefore regard Let us now think of N as corresponding to the point Q (z) = z2 as a function from. nfty . ˆC to ˆC. We have seen that 0 is a super-attracting fixed0 point ofwell?

2.5 Julia Sets of Polynomials

It can be shown that the only invertible holomorphic maps from C to C are polynomials of degree 1, that is, functions of the formaz + b with a . neq 0. The dynamical behavior of these maps is easy to analyze, simple, and hence not interesting. From now on, therefore, we shall consider only polynomials mials,$\infty P$ is a super-attracting fixed point, from which of degree at least 2.
For all such polynoit follows that the plane is split into two disjoint sets with qualitatively different dynamics, one consisting of points that are attracted to. nfty  and the other consist- ing of points that are not.

2.6 Properties of Julia Sets

In this section we shall list several common properties of Julia sets. The proofs of these, which are beyond the scope of this article, mostly depend on the theory of normal families. • The Julia set is the set of points for which the system displays sensitivity to initial conditions, i.e., the chaotic subset of the dynamical system.

• The repelling orbits belong to the Julia set and form a dense subset of the set. That is, any point in the Julia set can be approximated arbitrarily wellby a repelling point.

As we have noted already, if one repeatedly squares a complex number it will escape to infinity. The larger the modulus ofz of modulus greater than 1, thenz, the faster the iterates will tend to infinity. If instead of squaring, one applies a monic polynomial P of degree that the iteratesd, then for large enoughz, P (z)$, P^{2}(z)$, . . . ztend to infinity. Itit is again true follows from the formulaφ (Pk(z)) = φ (z()d)k. Therefore, the speed at whichφP (P (z)) = φP (z)d that the iterates tend to infinity depends not onon P |φ (z)|:
the larger the value of P |φ (z)|, the faster|z| but the convergence. For this reason, the level sets of$P^{P} |φ |$, P

A set which is compact, totally disconnected, and with no isolated points is called a cantor set [III.17](/part-03/dimension), since such a set is homeomorphic to Cantor’s middle-thirds set. Note that in this case$K = J$. For Qwe have the following dichotomy: the Julia setcc J is connected if 0 has a bounded orbit, cc

More over, a ray of argumentθ is mapped by P onto the ray of argu- ment R (θ)dθ, then, just as, when a num be rzd lies on the half-linez lies on the half-line R (dθ). 0 We say that an external ray lands if0ψ (r e2πiθ) con - P verges to a limit asr & 1.

In this case the ray is IV.14. Dynamics nonlanding. It can be shown that all rational rays land.
Since a rational ray is either periodic or pre-periodic under iteration byray must be either a periodic or a pre-periodic point P, the landing point of a rational in the Julia set. Much of the structure of the Julia set can be picked up from knowledge about common landing points. In the example illustrated in figure 2, the closures of the three Fatou components containing the critical orbit have one point in common. This point is a repelling fixed point and the common landing point of the rays of argument 1, 2, 4 .
The rays of argument 17 and 27 are adjacent to the Fatou component contain - 7 7 7 ing the critical valuec0. These two arguments will show up again in the parameter plane and tell us where$c0 is$ situated. 2.7.4 Local Connectedness In the example illustrated in figure 5 the inverse of the Böttcher map (the function{w}:|w| > 1 of all complex numbersψ-2) is defined on the setw of mod- ulus greater than 1. However, it can be continuously extended to a function defined on the larger setw:|then we havew| ⩾ 1.

connected. To understand what this means, imagine a set that is shaped like a comb. From any point in this set to any other point there is a continuous path that lies in the set, but it is possible for the two points to be very close and for the shortest path to be very long. This happens, for example, if the two points are the ends of neighboring teeth of the comb. A connected set X is called locally connected if every point has arbi- trarily small connected neighborhoods.
It is possible to build comb-like sets (with infinitely many teeth) that contain points for which all connected neighborhoods have to be large. The filled Julia sets in the examples in figures 2–5 are locally connected, but there are examples of filled Julia sets that are not locally connected. When K is locally connected, then all external rays P

land, and the landing point is a continuous function of the argument. Under these circumstances, we have a natural and useful parametrization of the Julia set$J^{P}$. 505 2.8 The Mandelbrot Set M

These regions will be separated by their boundaries, which together form the so-called$c$-values: that is, values of bifurcation set.

Since the Julia set represents the chaotic part of the dynamical system given by$Q^{c}$, the dynamical behavior is certainly qualitatively affected by whether to M or not. We have therefore made a start toward ourc belongs goal, but the division of the plane into M and C . \1 is very coarse, and it does not obviously give us the complete understanding we are looking for. ∂Mhas a number of “holes” (in fact, infinitely many).

This definition is similar to the definition of the Julia The Julia set provides a lot of structure in the dynam-ical plane, thez-plane.

Remarkably, even though each Julia506 Figure 7 The boundary. artial M of the Mandelbrot set. set concerns just one dynamical system, while the Man-del brot set concerns an entire family of systems, there are close analogies between them, as will become clear. and quadratic polynomials in particular was carried out in the early 1980 s by Adrien Douady and John H.Pioneering work on holomorphic dynamics in general Hubbard.
They introduced the name “Mandelbrot set”and proved several results about it. In particular, they defined a sort of Böttcher map, denoted byΦM, for the Mandelbrot set, which is a map from the complement of the Mandelbrot set to the complement of the closed unit disk. The definition ofΦMis actually quite simple: for each cfor the parameter let ΦM (c) equal φc. However, Douady and Hubbard didc (c), where φc is the Böttcher map more than merely define holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse.$Φ^{M}$: they proved that it is a just as we did with the Böttcher map.
For instance, Once we haveΦMwe can make further definitions, we can define a Mandelbrot set by setting potential GG(c)on the complement of the= g (c) = . og  |Φ (c)|.

2.10 Newton’s Method Revisited

Let us return briefly to Newton’s method for polyno-mials. Consider any polynomial P of degree d ⩾ 2 that has only simple roots. Then the Newton function a rational function of deg reed, and each simple root of NP is Pis a super-attracting fixed point of N . For quadratic P

polynomials the number of roots ofthe number of critical points of$N (since 2P \text{coincides withd} - 2 = 2P$

whend = 2). For polynomials of degree d > 2 there are more critical points than the roots can account for. polynomials with two distinct roots r Cayley considered Newton’s method for quadratic). He showed that the function \mu(z)P (z)==(z(z--r r)/(z1)(z--ront(o2)2), which maps the root. nfty , provides a change of variables that turnsr1 onto 0 and the root1 r2$509$ Nsphere ˆP into the quadratic polynomial C.
When one translates the dynamics of Q0 on the Riemann Q to the dynamics of Newton’s method one finds that the unit circle corresponds to the bisector ofr1 and (r2)0 and that all points in the half-plane containing$r$, i = 1,2, i are therefore attracted tori under iteration by NP. Cayley announced that he would write about Newton’s iteration for cubic polynomials. However, it took about a hundred years before any such paper appeared. For a cubic polynomial Newton function$N$has three super-attracting fixed P with three simple roots the P

points, each of which gives rise to an attracting basin. The Julia set of NP is the common boundary of these three basins, and is therefore a complicated fractal set. More over, N has an extra critical point since 2 d-2 = 4 P$for$ d = 3. The extra critical point may be attracted to one of the roots under iteration, or it can have its own independent behavior.
In order to catch the behavior of all cubic polynomials under Newton’s iteration (except the one with one root of multiplicity three) it is sufficient to consider the one-parameter family of polyno-mials$P (z) = (z - 1)(z - {}^{1} - λ)(z - {}^{1} + λ)$. The extra critical point for the corresponding Newton function N then turns out to be at the origin. Suppose that w(eλ()2)2 associate three colors, for instance red, blue, and green, with the three roots 1,λ1 +λ,1 -λ. We can then color the. ambda as follows.

Weis IV.15 Operator Algebras Nigel Higson and John Roe 1 The Beginnings of Operator Theory We can ask two basic questions about any equation, or system of equations: is there a solution, and, if there is, is it unique? Experience with finite systems of linear equations indicates that the two questions are interconnected. Consider for instance the equations 2$x + 3y - 5z = a$, x - 2 y + z = b,$3$ x + y - 4 z = c.

Notice that the left-hand side of the third equation isthe sum of the left-hand sides of the first two. As a result, no solution to the system exists unless But ifa + b = c, then any solution of the first two$a + b = c$. equations is also a solution of the third; and in any linear system involving more unknowns than equations, solutions, when they exist, are never unique. Inthe present case, if(x, y, z) is a solution, then so is(x + t, y + t, z + t), for any t. Thus the same phe- nomenon (a linear relation among the equations) that

The general theorem illustrated by our particular numerical example above is that the number of linear conditions that the$i^{j} f mustj$

satisfy if a solution is to exist is equal to the number ofarbitrary constants appearing in the general solution when a solution does exist. To use a more technical vocabulary, the dimension of the kernel [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of the matrix cokernel. In the example, these numbers are both 1.K = {kji} is equal to the dimension of its [VI.66](/part-06/ivar-fredholm-18661927) made a study of A little more than a hundred years ago, integral equations of the type fredholm

These arose from questions in theoretical physics, andthe problem was to solve for the functionu in terms of the function limit of finite sums, Fredholm’s equation is an infinite-f . Since an integral can be thought of as a dimensional counterpart of the finite-dimensional lin-ear systems considered above, in which vectors with nat infinitely many different points components are replaced by functions with value sx. (Strictly speaking, Fredholm’s equation is analogous to a matrix equationof the typeu-Ku = f rather than Ku = f .
The altered form of the left-hand side has no effect on the over all behavior of the matrix equation, but it does considerably alter the behavior of the integral equation. As we shall see, Fredholm was fortunate to work with a class of equations whose behavior mirrors that of matrix equations very closely.) A very simple example is

$u(y) - {}^{01} u(x) dx = f (y)$.

To solve this equation, it helps to observe that the quan-1 tityis a constant0 u(x) d. Thus in the homogeneous case (x, when thought of as a function off ≡ 0), y ,

So in this example the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the0 cokernel are both 1. Fredholm set out on a systematic exploration of the analogy between matrix theory and integral equations that this example suggests. He was able to prove that, for equations of his type, the dimen-sions of the kernel and of the cokernel are always finite and equal.
[VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), who made a detailed study of the Fredholm’s work sparked the imagination of hilbert integral operatorsin the special case where the real-valued function that transformu(y) into k(y, x)u(x) dxk, is symmetric, meaning thatk(x$, y) = k(y, x)$. The finite-dimensional counterpart of Hilbert’s theory is the theory of real symmetric matrices.
Now if K is such a matrix, then a standard result from linear algebra asserts that there is an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) for K, or equivalently that there is a unitary matrix U such that U-1 T U is diago- nal. (the lengths of vectors: Unitary means that Uv U is invertible and preserves = v for all vectors v.) Hilbert obtained an analogous theory for all symmetric integral operators. He showed that there exist func-tions$u1(y)$, u2(y), . . . and real numbers λ1, λ2, . . . such that k(y, x)un(x) dx = . ambda nun(y).

In this case, the theory of fourier seriesf (y) on [0, 1] can be expanded as the sum of a series[III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) tells us that a general function Hilbert showed that, in general, there is an analogous expansion(ak cos 2 kπy + bk sin 2 kπy) of cosines and sines.f (y) = anun(y)

1.1 From Integral Equations to Functional Analysis Hilbert’s spectral theorem led to an explosion of activ-ity, since integral operators arise in many different areas of mathematics (including, for example, the dirichlet problem equations and the representation theory of com-[IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis) in partial differential pact groups [IV.9 §3](/part-04/representation-theory)). It was soon recognized that these operators are best viewed as linear transforma-tions on the hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) of all functionsu(y) such that|u(y)|2 dy < . nfty .
Such functions are called square-integrable denoted L2[0, 1]. , and the collection of all of them is able, it became convenient to examine a much broader With the important concept of Hilbert space avail range of operators than the integral operators ini-tially considered by Fredholm and Hilbert. Since Hilbert spaces are[III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces), it made sense to look first at operators from a vector spaces [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and metric spaces Hilbert space to itself that are both linear and continu-ous: these are usually called bounded linear operators.
The analogue of the symmetry conditionk(x, y) =k(y, x)bounded linear operatoron integral operators is the condition that a T be self-adjoint, which is to say that T u, v = u, T v for all vectors u and v in the Hilbert space (the angle brackets denote the inner product). A simple example of a self-adjoint operator is the multiplication operator by a real-valued function m(y)(Mu)(y); this is the operator$= m(y)u(y)$.
(The finite-dimensional coun-Mdefined by the formula ter part to a multiplication operator is a diagonal matrix Kthe matrix entry, which multiplies thekjj.) jth component of the vector by operators tells us that every such operator can be givena particularly nice form: with respect to a suitable Hilbert’s spectral theorem for symmetric integral “basis” of L2[0, 1], namely a basis of eigenfunctions, it will have an infinite diagonal matrix. More over, the basis vectors can be chosen to be orthogonal to each other. For a general self-adjoint operator, this is not true.
Consider, for instance, the multiplication operator from L2[0, 1] to itself that takes each square-integrable function has no eigenvector su(y) to the function[I.3 §4.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions), since ifyu(y). This operator. ambda is an eigen- value every y[I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), then we need, which implies thatu(y)yu(y)= 0 for every= . ambda u(y)y notfor equal toλ, and hence that |u(y)|2 dy = 0.
However, this example is not particularly worrying, since a multiplication operator of this kind is a sort of continuous analogue of the operator defined by a diagonal matrix.

It turns out that if we enlarge our concept of “diagonal”to include multiplication operators, then all self-adjoint operators are “diagonalizable,” in the sense that, after a suitable “change of basis,” they become multiplication operators. of theof complex numbers To make this statement precise, we need the notion spectrum [III.86](/part-03/the-spectrum) of an operator. ambda for which the operator T. This is the set T - . ambda I does not have a bounded inverse (here I is the iden- tity operator on Hilbert space).
In finite dimensions the spectrum is precisely the set of eigenvalues, but in infinite dimensions this is not always so. Indeed, where as every symmetric matrix has at least one eigenvalue, a self-adjoint operator, as we have just seen, need not. As a result of this, the spectral theorem for bounded self-adjoint operators is phrased not in terms of eigen-values but in terms of the spectrum.
One way of formulating it is to state that any self-adjoint operator T is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator(Mu)(y) = m(y)u(y), where the closure of the range of the functionm(y) is the spectrum of T. Just as in the finite-dimensional case, aible operator U that preserves the lengths of vectors. To unitary operator is an invert- say that there is some unitary map T and M are unitarily equivalent is to say that U, which we can think of as an analogue of a change-of-basis matrix, such that$U^{-1MU}$.
This generalizes the statement that any real T = symmetric matrix is unitarily equivalent to a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues along the diagonal.

1.2 The Mean Ergodic Theorem

A beautiful application of the spectral theorem was found by von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957). Imagine a checkerboard on which are distributed a certain number ofcheckers. Imagine that for each square there is designated a “success or” square (in such a way that notwo squares have the same success or), and that every minute the checkers are rearranged by moving each oneto its success or square. Now focus attention on a single square and each minute record with a 1 or 0 whether or not there is a piece on the square. This produces a succession of readings R1$, R2$, R3, . .
.like this: 00100110010110100100· · · . We might expect that over time, the average number of positive readings R = 1 will converge to the num-j

ber of pieces on the board divided by the number of squares. If the rearrangement rule is not complicated enough, then this will not happen. For example, in the most extreme case, if the rule designates each square

IV. Branches of Mathematics

as its own success or, then the read out will be either00000· · · or 111111 · · · , depending on whether or not we chose a square with a piece on it to begin with. But ifthe rule is sufficiently complicated, then the “time average”ber of pieces on the board divided by the number of(1/n()n)j=1 Rj will indeed converge to the num- squares, as expected. fact the only “sufficiently complicated” rules in this finite case are cyclic permutations of the squares of the The checkerboard example is elementary, since in board, and thus vation post in succession.
However, there are related all the squares move past our obs er examples where one observes only a small fraction ofthe data. For instance, replace the set of squares on a checkerboard with the set of points on a circle, and in place of the checkers, imagine that a subset S of a cir- cle is marked as occupied. Let the rearrangement rulebe the rotation of points on the circle through some irrational number of degrees.
Stationed at a point the circle, we record whe the rx belongs to S, the firstx of rotated copy ofso on to obtain a sequence of 0 or 1 readings as before. S, the second rotated copy of S, and One can show that (for nearly every of our observations will converge to the proportion ofx) the time average the circle occupied by Similar questions about the relationship between S.
time and space averages had arisen in thermodynamics and elsewhere, and the expectation that time and space averages should agree when the rearrangement ruleis sufficiently complex became known as the ergodic hypothesis Von Neumann brought operator theory to bear on. this question in the following way. Let H be the Hilbert space of functions on the squares of the checkerboard, or the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the circle. The rearrangement rule gives rise to a unitary operator U on H by means of the formula(Uf )(y) = f (φ-1(y)),

(To apply this to our examples, take the pointx is occupied and 0 otherwise.)f (x) to be the function that is 1 if IV.15.
Operator Algebras tral theorem for unitary operators that is analogous to Von Neumann’s theorem can be deduced from a spec the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators. every unitary operator can be reduced to a multiplication operator, not by real-valued functions but by functions whose values are complex numbers of absolute value 1.The key to the proof then becomes a statement about complex numbers of absolute value 1: ifz is such a complex number, different from 1, then the expression(1/n)n zj approaches zero as n → . nfty.
This in turn is easily proved using the formula for the sum of a geo-metric series,$j = 1 n zj = z(1 - zn)/(1 - z)$. (More detail can be found injergodic theorems = 1 [V.9](/part - 05/ergodic - theorems).) 1.3 Operators and Quantum Theory Von Neumann realized that Hilbert spaces and their operators provide the correct mathematical tools to formalize the laws of quantum mechanics, introduced in the 1920 s by Heisenberg and Schrödinger. is the list of all the information needed to determine The state of a physical system at any given instant its future behavior.
If, for instance, the system con-sists of a finite number of particles, then classically its state consists of the list of the position and momentum vectors of all the constituent particles. By contrast, in von Neumann’s formulation of quantum mechanics one associates with each physical system a Hilbert space unit vector H, and a state of the system is represented by au in H.
(If u and v are unit vectors and v is a scalar multiple ofu, then u and v determine the same state.) the total energy of the system, or the momentum of one particle within the system) is a self-adjoint operator Associated with each observable quantity (perhaps Q on H whose spectrum is the set of all observed values of that quantity (hence the origin of the term “spec - trum”). States and observables are related as follows:

This may not be a value that Q is the is ever actually measured: rather, it is the average of values that are obtained from many repeated experiments with the system when it is in the given stateu. The relation between states and observables reflects the paradoxical behavior of quantum mechanics:
it is possible, and in fact typical, for a system to exist in a “superposed” state, under which repeated identical experiments produce distinct out comes. A measure-

If two oper-A distinctive feature of quantum theory is that the ators do not commute, then they will typically have no eigenvectors in common, and, as a result, simultaneous measurements of two different observables will typi-cally not result in determinate values for both of them.

This theorem allows one to determine explicitly For example, in a system consisting of a particle on aline subject to a force directed toward the origin which is proportional to the distance from the origin (as ifthe particle were attached to a spring, anchored at the origin), the operator for total energy is

E = − 2 m2 dd(x2)2 + k2 x2,

where strength of the force. The spectrum of this operatork is a constant which determines the over all is the set {(n + 1 2 ) (k/m)1/2}:$n = 0$,1,2, . . . . These are therefore the possible values for the total energy of the system. Notice that the energy can assume only a discrete set of values. This is another characteristic and fundamental feature of quantum theory. energy for the hydrogen atom. Like the operator above, Another important example is the operator of total

this may be realized as a certain explicit partial dif-ferential operator. It can be shown that the eigenvalues of this operator form a sequence proportional to$\\{−1}$, -1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, -1, . . . . A hydrogen atom, when disturbed, may release a photon, resulting in a drop in its total4 9 energy. The released photon will have energy equal tothe difference between the energies of the initial and final states of the atom, and therefore it is propor-tional to a number of the form 1/n2 - 1/m2.
When light from hydrogen is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, bright lines are indeed observed at wavelengths corresponding to these possible energies. Spectral observations of this sort provide experimental confirmation for quantum mechanical predictions. So far we have discussed states of a quantum system only at a single instant. However, quantum systems evolve in time, just as classical systems do: to describe this evolution we need a law of motion. The time evo-lution of a quantum system is represented by a family of unitary operators$U$: H \to H, parametrized by thet

real numbers. If the system is in an initial state will be in the state Ut u after t units of time. Bec au seu, it the passage of units is the same as the passage ofs units of time followed bys + t units, the uni-t further tary operators An important theorem of Marshall Stone asserts that Ut satisfy the group law Us Ut = (Us)+t. there is a one-to-one correspondence between unitary groups{U } and self-adjoint operators E given by thet

formula

i E = dd U(tt)t=0 = . imt\to0 1 t (Ut - I). The quantum law of motion is that the responding in this way to time evolution is the opera-generator E cor- tor associated with the observable “total energy.” When$E$is realized as a differential operator on a Hilbert space of functions (as in the examples above), this state-ment becomes a differential equation, the Schrödinger equation.

The time-evolution operators satisfy the law U U = U. More generally, we define$U^{t} \text{of quantum mechanics}$ a family of unitary operators unitary representation(st)sof a+t Ugroup, one for each[I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)g G \in to be a G, sat- i sfy ing the law(Ug()1()g)2 = (Ug)1(Ug()g)2 for all g1, g2 \in  G.

Conversely, from a positive-definite function GNS construction and Irving Segal) begins by considering the group ele-(in honor of Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark, ments themselves as basis vectors in an abstract vector space. We can attempt to define an inner product on this vector space by means of the formula

$g1$, g2 = σ ((g1)-1 g2).

The resulting object may differ from a genuine hilbert space in two respects. First, there may be nonzero vectors whose length, as measured by the inner product, iszero (although the hypothesis thatσis positive definite does rule out the possibility that there might be vectors of negative length). Second, the completeness axiom [III.62](/part - 03/normed - spaces - and - banach - spaces) of Hilbert space theory may not be satisfied. However, there is a “completion” procedure which fixes both these deficiencies.
Applied in the present case, it produces a Hilbert space Hσ that carries a unitary representation of G. areas of mathematics. They have the advantage that the functions on which the constructions are based are Versions of the GNS construction arise in several easy to manipulate. For instance, convex combinations of positive-definite functions are again positive definite, and this allows geometrical methods to be applied to the study of representations.
1.5 Determinants and Traces The original works of Fredholm and Hilbert borrowed heavily from traditional concepts of linear algebra, and in particular the theory ofview of the complicated definition of the determinant determinants [III.15](/part - 03/determinants). In even for finite matrices, it is perhaps not surprising that the infinite-dimensional situation presented extraordinary challenges. Very soon, much simpler alternative approaches were found that avoided determinants altogether.
But it is interesting to note that the determinant, or to be more exact the related notion of the trace, has played an important role in recent developments on which we will report later in this article. IV.15. Operator Algebras The trace of ann . imes n matrix is the sum of its diag- onal entries. As with the determinant, the trace of a matrix A is equal to the trace of BAB - 1 for any invert- ible matrixnant by the formula det B.
In fact, the trace is related to the determi-(. xp (A)) = . xp (tr(A)) (because of the invariance properties of trace and determinant, it is enough to check this for diagonal matrices, where it is easy). In infinite dimensions the trace need not make sense since the sum of the diagonal entries ofan. nfty × . nfty matrix may not converge. (The trace of the identity operator is a case in point:
the diagonal entries are all 1, and if there are infinitely many of them, then their sum is not well-defined.) One way to address this problem is to limit one self to operators for which thesum is well-defined. An operator T is said to be of trace class of pairwise orthogonal vectors of length 1, the sumif, for every two sequencesuj and vj . nfty

operator the sumj = {}1 T uj T, v . nftyhas a well-defined and finite trace, name lyj T uis absolutely convergent. A trace-class, u (which is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis j = {}1 jj {u }).j

Integral operators such as those appearing in Fredholm’s equation provide natural examples of trace-class operators. Ifk(y, x) is a smooth function, then the operator T u(y) = k(y, x)u(x) dx is of trace class, and its trace is equal tok(x, x) dx, which can be regarded as the “sum” of the diagonal elements ofthe “continuous matrix”k. 2 Von Neumann Algebras Theon a Hilbert space commutant of a set H is the collection S of bounded linear operators S^  of all operators oncommutant of any set is an H that commute with every operator in the set algebra of operators on S.

If H0 is invariant, then since the operators invariant subspace for the representa-Ug map Hre presentation of0 to itself, their restrictions to G, called a subrepresentati on H0 constitute another of the original. A subspace H0 is invariant for a representation, and so determines a subrepresentati on, if and only if the orthogonal projection operator P:$H \to H belongs$ to the commutant of that representation.
This points to a close connection between subrepresentati ons and0 von Neumann algebras. In fact, von Neumann algebra theory can be thought of as the study of the ways in which unitary representations can be decomposed into sub representations. ial invariant subspace.

As with prime factorization, the decomposition process for a finite-dimensional unitary representation has only one possible end:
there is, up to ordering, a unique list of irreducible representations into which a given unitary representation decomposes.

516

But in infinite dimensions the decomposition process faces a number of difficulties, the most surprising of which is that there may be two decompositions ofthe same representation into entirely different sets of irreducible subrepresentati ons. In the face of this, a different form of decomposition suggests itself, which is roughly analogous to the factorization of an integer into prime powers instead of individual primes. Let us refer to the prime powers into which an integer is decomposed as its components. They have two characteristic properties:
no two com-pone nts share a common factor, and any two (proper) factors of the same component factor. Similarly, one can decompose a unitary repre-do share a common sentation intogous properties: no two distinct isotypical components isotypical components, which have analoshare a common (meaning isomorphic) subrepresentati on, and any two subrepresentati ons of the same isotypical component have themselves a common subsub representation.
Any unitary representation (finite dimensional or not) can be decomposed into isotypical components, and this decomposition is unique. In finite dimensions, every isotypical representation decomposes into a (finite) number ofducible subrepresentati ons (like the prime factors ofidentical irrea prime power). In infinite dimensions this is not so. In effect, much of von Neumann algebra theory is concerned with analyzing the many possibilities that arise. 2.2 Factors The commutant of an isotypical unitary representation is called a factor.
Concretely, a factor is a von Neumann algebra M that commute with every member of M whose center, the set of all operators in M , consists of nothing more than scalar multiples of the identity oper - ator. This is because projections in the center of M cor- respond to projections onto combinations of i so typical sub representations. Every von Neumann algebra can be uniquely decomposed into factors. A factor is said to be of type I if it arises as the commutant of an isotypical representation that is a multi-ple of a single irreducible representation.
Every type I factor is isomorphic to the algebra of all bounded oper-ators on a Hilbert space. In finite dimensions, every factor is of type I, since as we already noted every isotyp - ical representation decomposes into a multiple of one irreducible representation. The existence of unitary representations with more than one decomposition into irreducible components is IV. Branches of Mathematics related to the existence of factors that are Von Neumann, together with Francis Murray, invest i-not of type I.
gated this possibility in a series of papers that mark the foundation of operator algebra theory. They introduced an order structure on the collection of subrepresentati ons of a given isotypical representation or, toput it in terms of the commutant, on the collection of projections in a given factor. If re sent at i ons of the isotypical representation H0 and H1 are subrep - H, then we write sent at i on of H0 H( . Murray and von Neumann proved that H1 if H0 is isomorphic to a sub re pre- this is a total ordering: either or both, in which case1 H0 and H(H0)1 are isomorphic. For( H1;

we shall never reach an irreducible “atom.” Nevertheless, subrepresentati ons can still be compared insize by means of the “real-valued dimension” provided by Murray and von Neumann’s theorem. A not able example of a factor of type II may be obtained as follows. Let G be a group and let H =2(G) be a Hilbert space having basis vectors ing to the ele men tsg \in  G. Then there is a natural rep-[g] correspond- resentation ofplication law, called the G on H derived from the group multi-regular representation:

There is a simple explicit formula for the real-valued dimensionof a subrepresentati on corresponding to an orthogonal projection ative to the basis P \in M. Represent[g] of H . Because Pby an infinite matrix rel-P commutes with the representation, it is easy to see that the diagonal elements of P are all the same, equal to some real num- ber between 0 and 1. This real number is the dimensionof the subrepresentati on corresponding to P .
theory has found unexpected applications in[I.3 §6.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Many important topological concepts, such More recently, the Murray–von Neumann dimension topology as Betti numbers, are defined as the (integer - valued)dimensions of certain vector spaces. Using von Neumann algebras, one can define real-valued counterparts of these quantities that have useful additional properties. In this way, one can use von Neumann algebra theory to obtain topological conclusions.
The von Neumann algebras used here are typically obtained bythe construction of the previous paragraph from the fundamental group [IV.6 §2](/part - 04/algebraic - topology) of some compact space. 2.3 Modular Theory Type III factors remained rather mysterious for a long time;
indeed, Murray and von Neumann were at first unable to determine whether any such factors existed. They eventually managed to do so, but the fundamental breakthrough in the area came well after their pioneer-ing work, when it was realized that each von Neumann algebra has a special family of symmetries, its so-called modular automorphism group. sider once again the von Neumann algebra obtained from the regular representation of a group To explain the origins of modular theory, let us con - G.

This would have yielded a different difference is unimportant, because the map[g So long as we deal only with discrete groups-1] is a unitary operator on H that interchanges the S: G[g]this . oleft and right regular representations. But for certain continuous groups the problem arises that the function f (g) may be square-integrable while f (g - 1) is not.
In this situation there is no simple unitary isomorphism analogous to the one for discrete groups. To remedy this, one must introduce a correction factor called the modular function of G. 517 thing analogous to the modular function can be con-struc ted for any von Neumann algebra. This object then The project of modular theory is to show that some serves as an invariant for all factors of type III, whether or not they are explicitly derived from groups. struc tion (section 1.4).

For the purposes of modular theory we restrict attention towhichφ(T*T ) = 0 implies T =faithful0. If φstates, those foris a state, then the formula T1, T2 = φ(T1*T2) defines an inner product on the vector space ing the GNS procedure, we obtain a Hilbert space M.

where on the right-hand side we use multiplication inthe algebra M . Because of this observation, we can think ofan algebra of operators on whatever Hilbert space we M as an algebra of operators on HM, rather than as began with. Next, the adjoint operation equips the Hilbert space $\text{Hby the formula}^{M}$ with a natural “antilinear” operator1$S(V ) = V^{*}$. Since U* =SU:$H^{M}\text{for the} \to H^{M}$ regular representation, this is indeed analogous to the operator S we encountered in our discussion of contin-g g -1 uous groups.

For example, the set ${t \in R}$: T \to  Ut T U-t is an inner automorphism is a subgroup of R and an invariant of M that can be used to distinguish between uncountably many different type III factors.

These are the factors that are Be sides the range of the dimension function, which sep-arates factors into types, the sole invariant is the module from the modular automorphism group.. This is a flow on a certain space that is assembled standing problem of distinguishing among the type IIfactors associated with the regular representations of A lot of attention is currently being given to the long groups.
Of special interest is the case of free groups [IV.10 §2](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory), around which has flourished the subject offree probability theory. Despite intensive effort, some fundamental questions remain open: at the time of writing it is unknown whether the factors associated with the free groups on two and on three generators are isomorphic. theory Another important development has been, which attempts to classify the ways in which subfactor factors can be realized within other factors.
A remark-able and surprising theorem of Vaughan Jones shows that, in the type II situation, where continuous values of dimensions are the norm, the dimensions of subfactors can in certain situations assume only a discrete range of values. The combinatorics associated with this result have also appeared in other apparently quite unrelated parts of mathematics, notably knot theory [III.44](/part-03/knot-polynomials). 3$C^{*} - Algebras$ Von Neumann algebra theory helps describe the structure of a single representation of a group on a hilbert space.
But in many situations it is of interest to gain an

understanding of all possible unitary representations. To shed some light on this problem we turn to a related but different part of operator algebra theory. Consider the collection B(H) of all bounded oper- ators on a Hilbert space ent structures: algebraic operations, such as addition,$H$. It has two very differ multiplication, and formation of adjoints; and analytic structures, such as the operator norm

$T = \sup {T u}$:$u ⩽ 1$.

These structures are not independent of one another. Suppose, for instance, that T < 1 (an analytic hypoth- esis). Then the geometric series

$S = I + T + T^{2} + T^{3} + · · ·$

converges in B(H), and its limit Ssatisfies S(I - T ) = (I - T )S = I.

It follows that I - T is invertible in B(H) (an algebraic conclusion). One can easily deduce from this that the spectral radius the greatest absolute value of any complex number inr (T ) of any operator T(defined to be the spectrum of The remarkable T ) is less than or equal to its norm.spectral radius formula goes much further in the same direction. It asserts that. im (Tn()1)/n. If T is normal (T T* = T*T), and inr (T ) = particular if(Tn)n =→. nfty T Tn. As a result, the spectral radius ofis self-adjoint, then it may be shown that T is precisely equal to the norm of T.
There is therefore a very close connection between the algebraic structureof B(H), particularly algebraic structure related to the adjoint operation, and the analytic structure. Not all the properties of B(H) are relevant to this connection between algebra and analysis.

3.2 Further Examples of$C^{*} - Algebras$

3.2.1 The Compact Operators

An operator on a Hilbert space has range is a finite-dimensional subspace. The operators finite rank if its of finite rank form an algebra, and its closure is a$C^{*}-$ algebra called the algebra of denoted K. One can also view compact Kas a “limit” of matrix operators and algebras $M^{1}(C) \to M^{2}(C) \to M^{3}(C) → · · ·$, where each matrix algebra is included in the next by

$A \to A0 00$.

Many natural operators are compact, including the inte-gral operators that arose in Fredholm’s theory. The identity operator on a Hilbert space is compact if and only if that Hilbert space is finite dimensional.

3.2.2 The CAR Algebra

The presentation of K as a limit of matrix algebras leads one to consider other “limits” of a similar sort.(We shall not attempt a formal definition of these limits here, but it is important to note that the limit of a sequence A \to  A \to  A → · · · depends on the homo- morphisms One particularly important example is obtained as the1 Ai \to2(Ai()+1)3 as well as on the algebras Ai.) limit $M1(C) \to M2(C) \to M4(C) → · · ·$, where each matrix algebra is included in the next by

This means that the homogeneous equation T u =0 admits only finitely many linearly independent solutions, while the in homogeneous equation$T u = v \text{admits a solution if} v$ satisfies a finite number of linear conditions. The terminology arises from Fredholm’s original work on integral equations; he showed that if K is an integral operator, then I + K is a Fredholm operator.
dimensions of the kernel and cokernel must be equal, but in general this need not be so. The For the operators that Fredholm considered, the unilateral shift operator tor”(a , a , a S, . . . ), which maps the infinite “row vec-to$(0, a , a , . . . )$, is an example. The equation the equation1 2 Su^3 Su == 0 has only the zero solution, butv has a solution only if the first1 2 coordinate of the vectorv is zero. integer difference The index of a Fredholm operator is defined to be the index$(T ) = \dim (ker(T )) - \dim (coker(T ))$.
For example, every invertible operator is a fredholm operator of index 0, where as the unilateral shift is a Fredholm operator of index-1.

Atkin-son’s theorem asserts that an operator An important theorem of Frederick Atkinson gives T is Fredholm if and only if it is invertible modulo compact opera-tors. This implies that any operator that is sufficiently close to a Fredholm operator is itself a Fredholm operator with the same index, and that ifoperator and K is a compact operator, then T is a Fredholm T + K is a Fredholm operator with the same index asthat, since integral operators are compact operators, T . Notice this contains Fredholm’s original theorem as a special case.

4.2 The Toeplitz Index Theorem

Atkinson’s theorem tells us that the Fredholm index is a topological quantity. In many contexts it is possible to obtain a for-mula for the index of a Fredholm operator in terms of other, apparently quite different, topological quan-tities. Formulas of this sort often indicate deep connections between analysis and topology and often have powerful applications. The simplest example involves the Toeplitz operators.
A Toeplitz operator has a matrix with the special form⎛ ⎞⎜⎜⎜bb^0^-^1 bb^1^0 bb^2^1 bb^3^2 · · ·· · ·⎟⎟⎟T = ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜bb^-^-^2^3 bb^-^-^1^2 bb^0^-^1 bb^1^0 · · ·· · ·⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟ .⎝ ... ... ... ... . .. ⎠

In other words, as you go down each diagonal ofthe matrix, the entries remain constant. The sequence of coefficients$\infty=−$. nfty bnz-n on the unit circle in the complex plane$,{bn}\infty\text{n}=−$. nfty defines a function$f$ (z) = called the shown that a Toeplitz operator whose symbol is a con-n symbol of the Toeplitz operator. It can be tinuous function which is never zero is Fredholm. Whatis its index? as a mapping from the unit circle to the nonzero com-plex numbers: in other words, as a closed path in the The answer is given by thinking about the symbol nonzero complex plane.
The fundamental topological invariant of such a path is its winding number: the number of times it “goes around” the origin in the counter clockwise direction. It can be proved that the index of a Toeplitz operator with nonzero symbol is minus the winding number off . For example, if ff is the function$f (z) = z (\text{with winding number} + 1)$,

521

then the associated Toeplitz operator is the unilateral shift S that we encountered earlier (with index -1). The Toeplitz index theorem is a very special case of the atiyah–singer index theorem topological formula for the indices of various Fredholm[V.2](/part-05/the-atiyahsinger-index-theorem), which gives a operators that arise in geometry.

4.3 Essentially Normal Operators

Atkinson’s theorem suggests that compact perturb a-tions of an operator are in some sense “small.” This leads to the study of properties of an operator that are preserved by compact perturbation. For instance, the complex numbers essential spectrum. ambda for which of an operator T - . ambda I fails to be Fred-T is the set of holm (that is, invertible modulo compact operators).Two operators T and T are essentially equivalent if there is a unitary operator differ by a compact operator.
A beautiful theorem orig - 1 2 U such that UT1 U* and T2 inally due toor normal operators are essentially equivalent if and weyl [VI.80](/part - 06/hermann - weyl - 18851955) asserts that two self-adjoint only if they have the same essential spectrum. tors in this theorem is in appropriate. Since we are con-cerned with properties that are preserved by compact One might argue that the restriction to normal opera perturbation, would it not be more appropriate to consider T for which essentially normal T*T - T T*operators—that is, operatorsis compact?
This apparently modest variation leads to an unexpected result. the unilateral shift S is an example of an essentially nor- mal operator. Its essential spectrum is the unit circle, as is the essential spectrum of its adjoint; however,$S$ and S* cannot be essentially equivalent, because S has index - 1 and S* has index + 1. Thus some new ing red i - ent, beyond the essential spectrum, is needed to clas-sify essentially normal operators.
In fact, it follows easily from Atkinson’s theorem that if essentially normal operators T and T are to be essentially equivalent, then not only must they have the same essential spec-trum but also, for every1 2. ambda not in the essential spectrum, the Fredholm index ofholm index of T - . ambda IT.

4.4 K - Theory A remarkable feature of the Brown–Douglas–fill more work was the appearance within it of tools from 522 algebraic topology ber that, according to the Gelfand–Naimark theorem,[IV.6](/part - 04/algebraic - topology), notably K-theory. Remem- the study of (suitable) topological spaces and the study of commutative C*-algebras are one and the same; all the techniques of topology can be transferred, via the Gelfand–Naimark isomorphism, to commutative$C^{*}-$ algebras.
Having made this observation, it is natural to ask which of these techniques can be extended further, to provide information about all$C^{*} - algebras$, commutative or not.

This follows from the fact that two Fred- holm operators are connected by a path of fredholm operators if and only if they have the same index. can construct ent ingredients.
For example, every projection One of the great strengths of$K$-theory classes from a variety of differ-K-theory is that onep \in  A defines a class in“dimension” for the range of K(A) which can be thought of as ap. This connects K-theory to the classification of factors (section 2.2), and has become an important tool in the effort to classify various families of C*-algebras, such as the irrational rota- tion algebras. (It was at one time thought that the irra-tional rotation algebras might not contain any nontrivial projections at all:
the construction of such pro-jections by Marc Rieffel was an important step in the development of C* - algebra K - theory.)

The IV.

Most of the progress onthe conjecture to date is the result of work of Gennadi Kasparov, who dramatically broadened the original discoveries of Brown, Douglas, and Fill more to cover not just single essentially normal operators but also noncommuting systems of operators, that is,$C* - alge-$ bras. Kasparov’s work is now a central component ofoperator algebra theory.
5 Noncommutative Geometry descartes’s [VI.11](/part - 06/ren - descartes - 15961650) invention of coordinates showed that one can do geometry by thinking about coordinate functions rather than directly thinking about points in space and their inter relationships: these coordinate functions are the familiarx, y, and z. The Gelfand Naimark theorem can be viewed as one expression ofthis idea of passing from the “point picture” of a space Xtions on it.
The success ofto the “field picture” of the algebra K-theory in operator algebras C(X) of func- invites us to ponder whether the field picture might bemore powerful than the point picture, since K-theory can be applied to noncommutative C* - algebras which may not have any “points” (homomorphisms to C) at all. One of the most exciting research frontiers in operator algebra theory is reached along a path which develops these thoughts.
The noncommutative geometry general program of Connes takes seriously the idea that a C*-algebra should be thought of as an algebra of functions on a “noncommutative space,” and goes onto develop “noncommutative” versions of many ideas from geometry and topology, as well as completely new constructions that have no commutative counterpart. Noncommutative geometry begins with the cre-ative reformulation of ideas from ordinary geometry in ways that involve only operators and functions, but not points. Consider, for instance, the circle S1.
The algebra C(S1)reflects all the topological properties of S1, but to incorporate its well we look not just at metric (distance - related) properties as C(S1) but at the pair consisting of the algebra Hilbert space C(SH = 1 L)2 and the operator(S1).

1 What Is Mirror Symmetry?

Mirror symmetry is a phenomenon found in theoretical physics that has had profound mathematical applica-tions. It burst onto the mathematical scene after Can del as, de la Ossa, Green, and Parkes exploited the physical phenomenon to make precise predictions about certain sequences of numbers describing geometric spaces. The sequence predicted by those authors began 2875, 609 250, 317 206 375, of calculation at the time. The phenomenon of mirror. . . , and was far beyond the scope symmetry is that some physical theories have equiv-alent, “mirror” theories that lead to the same predictions.
If some prediction requires a hard calculation but is easy to perform in the mirror theory, then you can getthe answer for free! These physical theories do not have to be realistic models of physics. For instance, beginning students of physics often study point particleson frictionless planes. Although they are unrealistic, such toy models can bring the physical concepts into focus and their analysis can give rise to very interesting mathematics.

1.1 Exploiting Equivalences

Children at school in the 1950 s used log tables to exploit the equivalence of multiplication of positive numbers with addition of real numbers. Given the prob-lem of multiplying two large numbers a and b, they would use a table to look up the logarithms log(a) and log then add them by hand. They would then use the same(b)(to a certain number of significant figures), table to find which number had a logarithm equal to$\log (a) + \log (b)$. The answer is ab.
defined by College students some times exploit the equivalence fourier transforms [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) to solve differential equations. Basically, the Fourier transform isa rule that maps one functionf (x) to a new func- tion ˆderivativef (p). What is nice is that the transform of thef^ (x)relates in a very simple way to ˆf (p):
it is i If you want to solve a differential equation such aspf (p)ˆ , where i is the imaginary number. qrt{-1}$.f (x) + 2 f (x) = h(x)$, where h(x) is a given function and you are trying to findto its Fourier transform equation if , you can map the equationpf (p)ˆ$+$2 ˆ$f (p) =h(p)$ˆ . This is much easier: it is an algebraic equation

524

rather than a differential equation, and has the solu-tion ˆ$f (p) = h(p)/($ˆ 2$+ ip)$. The solution f (x) is then the function which has ˆh(p)/(2 + ip) as its Fourier transform. Mirror symmetry is like a fancy Fourier transform, mapping much more information than is contained ina single function. Every aspect of a physical theory is involved. This article will (eventually) focus on the mathematics of mirror symmetry, but it is crucial to understand its physical origins. We therefore begin with a brief guide to physics.
(For a further discussion of math-ematical physics, see vertex operator algebras [IV.17 §2](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras).) This is in no way an adequate treatment—a separatewe hope to give enough of the flavor of the subject to Companion to Physics would be needed—but help the reader with the later sections.

The force is itself the (negative) gradient of a gravitational potential equation can be written$mx$ ̈$+ ∇V (x) = V (x)0$. Stationary, so this particles sit at minima of the potential:
examples area ball in equilibrium at the end of a spring, or a pea at the bottom of a bowl. In stable situations, there is arestoring force proportional to some displacement distance. This means that in some appropriate coordinate, F ∼ −x, so V (x) = kx2/2, for some k. The solutions are oscillatory, with angular frequencyω = k/m. This model is called the simple harmonic oscillator.

2.1.2 The Least Action Principle

Every major theory can also be formulated by means ofan idea known as the least action principle. Let us see how it works for the equations of Newtonian mechan-ics. Consider an arbitrary path of a particlex(t) and time. We denote position byp one nt position vector, and we denote time derivatives by dots, so1.

Likewise, we omit component notation on most vectors. The notation should be clear from the context. The quantity S(x), which is known as the action energy.

It leads to first-order’s [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) formulation of the equations of equations. Let Sbe the action and define L by S = L dt, and consider the (typical) case where coordinate sx and their time derivatives  ̇L is a function ofx. Then setpon  ̇=xd.

One considers a space endowed with a bracket operation on functions, such that there are coordinate functions (not uniquely determined) obeying\\\{x, p\\\} =-1. The mechanical model is defined by a function H(x, p), which determines the dynamics. 2.1.4 Symmetry A brief remark on symmetry is in order.
noether [VI.76](/part - 06/emmy - noether - 18821935) proved that in the action formulation of me - chanics, a symmetry of the action results in a conserved quantity. The prototypical example is transla-tional or rotational symmetry, where the potential of a particle is invariant under some direction of trans-lation or rotation: the corresponding conserved quantity is then momentum or angular momentum. In the example above, V (x) = k|x|2/2 is independent of θ, the phase ofvaryingθ is dx.
The equation of motion determined by(m|x|2θ)/ ̇ dt = 0, so in this case it is the angular momentum m|x|2θ̇ that is conserved. In the Hamiltonian formulation, since a conserved quantity zero Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian: f (x, p) does not change with time, it must have\. \1, f \\ = 0. In particular, the Hamiltonian itself is conserved. 525 2.1.5 Action Functions for Other Theories Returning now to action principles, we shall see how different physical theories are described through different actions.
In electricity and magnetism, equations [IV.13 §1.1](/part - 04/general - relativity - and - the - einstein - equations) can be formulated in the form maxwell’s δS = 0, where now the action S takes the form of an integral over space and time of the electric net ic(B)fields. In the case where there are no sources,(E) and mag- the action is written S = 8πe12 [E2 - B2] dx dt, (2) where is one important difference from the previous exam - e is the electric charge of an electron.

If you rewrite S in terms of A, vary A by δA, and set δS = 0, then you recover Maxwell’s equations from the least action principle. It is clear that the electromagnetic action merely changes sign under the replacement and therefore any solutionδS = 0 remains a solu - E \to B, B → −E, tion under the transformation.
This is an example ofan equivalence of a classical theory of physics. In fact, this symmetry extends to the case where there are sources (such as electrons) if we also interchange electric and magnetic sources. (No magnetic sources have been observed in the universe, but a theory with such objects still makes sense.) Lesson.sources. Physical equivalences act on fields and their Electricity and magnetism is a “field theory,” which means that the degrees of freedom involve functions that depend on position in space.
Contrast this with Newtonian mechanics, where the spatial degrees of freedom are just the coordinates of the particle(s). However, there is not much conceptual distance between the two, as can be seen in the following toy model. φvalues. Now imagine that space has just one dimen-. That is, We will consider the simplest example: a scalar field,φ is just a function that takes numerical sion, not three, and further that that dimension is a circle, which we can describe with an angular coordinate,θ.

2.2 Quantum Theory

Mirror symmetry is an equivalence of quantum theo-ries, so we must develop an understanding of what a quantum theory is and what an equivalence looks like. There are two formulations of quantum mechanics: the operator formulation and Feynman’s path-integral formulation. Both formulations are probabilistic, meaning that you cannot predict exactly what will be observed in at the origin.3. In 3-space, the paraboloidz =1 2 ax2 +1 2 by2 has curvature ab

For instance, your experimental apparatus may involve a beam of electrons hitting a screen and making a mark. The beam will contain millions of electrons, so the pattern of marks on the screen can be predicted with great accuracy.
However, we cannot say what will happen toa single, given electron—all we can do is assign probabilities to the out comes of various measurements. These probabilities are encoded in the so-called “wave function”Ψ of the particle.

2.2.1 Hamiltonian Formulation

In the operator formulation of quantum mechanics, the positions and moment a of classical mechanics (and any quantity formed from them) are converted intotors [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) acting on a hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) accord-opera ing to the following rule:{· ,·} by i/ [· ,·], where [A, B]replace the Poisson bracket= AB -BA is the commu- tator bracket ple, we get from equation (1) the relation and is Planck’s constant.
Thus, for exam-[x$, p] = i .$ The state of a particle (or system) is now defined not as a set of values of Hilbert space. Once again, time evolution is determinedx and p but as a vector Ψ in the by the Hamiltonian, basic dynamical equation is H, but now H is an operator. The HΨ = i ddt Ψ . (5)

This is called the Schrödinger equation.

Lesson. To quantize a classical theory, replace ordinary degrees of freedom by operators on a vector space; replace Poisson brackets by commutator brackets. In the case where we have a particle on the real line R, the Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable func-tions L2(R), so we write Ψ as Ψ (x). The commutation relation is obeyed if we think ofx as the operator that sends the function the relation[x, p] =Ψ (x)i means that we should repre-to the function xΨ (x). Now sentp as the operator - i (d/dx).
The values of the classical quantity associated with an operator correspond to theso for example a state with momentum eigenvalues [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of that operator, p has the formΨ ∼ . xp (ipx/ ). Unfortunately, this is not square- integrable on the real line, but it would become so ifwe identifiedx and x +2πR, for some number (radius)R > 0. Topologically, this compactifies [III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) R to a circle, but note thatΨ will be single-valued only if IV.16.

In other examples, there is a or not it represents a geometric location. Another novelty is that position and momentum do not commute as operators in quantum mechanics, meaning they cannot be simultaneously diagonalized: you cannot specify the position and momentum simultaneously.
This is a form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (see operator algebras [IV.15 §1.3](/part-04/operator-algebras)). 2.2.2 Symmetry As the rules of quantization would suggest, a symmetry of a quantum theory is an operator[H, A] = 0. That is, A commutes with the Hamiltonian, A such that and therefore respects the dynamics. 2.2.3 Example: The Simple Harmonic Oscillator We now discuss an example that will be useful later on for understanding quantum field theory and mirror symmetry: the simple harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics.

2.2.4 Path-Integral Formulation

Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum me-chanics builds on the idea of the least action principle. In this formulation, the probability of an experiment is calculated through an average over all paths of particles, and not just the ones which extremize the action. Each pathx(t) is weighted by the factor exp(i S(x)/ ), where Planck’s constant, which is very small compared with S(x) is the action of the path x(t) and is macroscopic action scales. This average can be an imag-inary number, but the probability of the process is the square of its absolute value.
Note that exp$(i S/ ) = \cos (S/ ) + \text{i sin}(S/ )$, so if S changes appreciably when we vary and imaginary parts will oscillate rapidly, sincex(t), then the realis small. Then, when we integrate over pathsx(t), the positive and negative oscillations will roughly cancel. As a result, the main contributions to the weighted sum over paths will come from those paths for which not vary when the path does: the classical paths! How-S does ever, if the variations are sufficiently small compared with , then nonclassical paths can contribute appreciably.
One typically separates the degrees of freedom into the classical trajectory piece and the quantum fluctuations near it. Then one can organize the path integralin a perturbation theory around the parameter . integral, and will not go into the details of this. The We have not yet discussed the integrand of the path main point is that the theory makes a prediction about the likelihood of measuring a physical process. Each process determines a possible integrand.
For example, from our discussion above we learn that the integrand for measuring the likelihood of a quantum-mechanical particle going from the pointx at time t to the pointx1 at time t1 gives nonzero weight—determined by the0 0 exponentiated action—to all paths that go fromx as t goes from t to t , and zero weight to all otherx0 to paths.1 0 1 integral on a “space-time” that consists of just a single It is illustrative to consider a toy model of a path point. Then the possible “paths” of a scalar field, say, are simply the values that the field can take at the point, so they are real numbers.
The action is then an ordinary function let us consider the case where i S(x) on R. For the purposes of this example, S/ = −1 x2 +. ambda x3. The possible integrands are (sums of) powers of basic path integrals to perform are(x2)k . xp x(-, so the1 x2 +. ambda x3)dx, which we denote by xk. The value at2λ = 0

This is how we construct a well- defined perturbation theory, even when the integral isnot calculable. iest when the action is only quadratic in the variables, just as we found in the operator formulation of quan-As we see from this example, path integrals are eastum mechanics.
The mathematical reason for this isthat Gaussian integrals (exponentials of squares) can be done explicitly, while integrals involving exponen-tials of cubics or higher are difficult or impossible. For quadratic actions, the path integral can be evaluated exactly, but when cubic or higher terms appear, the perturbation series is necessary.

2.2.5 Quantum Field Theory

The generalization to field theories follows our earlier pattern. We think of quantum field theories, then, as being like quantum mechanics with infinite numbers of particles. In fact, the quantum field theories in which the fieldsΦ and their derivatives do not have more than quadratic terms in the action are easily understood inthis way—we had a preview of this in equation (4). The Fourier components correspond to particles indexed by their moment a. Each one looks like a simple harmonic oscillator at some frequency, which will depend on the Fourier coefficient.
The quantum Hilbert space is then a (tensor) product of lots of different “occupation num-ber Hilbert spaces,” one for each Fourier component of each field. Since the occupation number basis is alsoan energy eigenbasis, these states have a simple time evolution under the hamiltonian on some state$Ψ (t = 0)$, then that state evolves like H. That is, if H = EΨ (t) = . xp (i Et/ )Ψ (0).

higher However, if the action includes terms that are, then things get interesting: particles can decay!cubic or This can be seen, for example, from the scalar field ofequation (3) if we include a termφ3 in the action, and therefore also the Hamiltonian. If we write this using Fourier components, we get terms involving three oscillators, such aswe quantize the real field(a†)3(a†)4 a7. To see this, recall that afterφ, the Fourier components$7$.

Such decay processes occur in real life, and it is a great triumph of quantum field theory that it can predict such events with astounding accuracy.
dimensional, the path integral in quantum field theory is not usually defined in a mathematically rigorous way. In fact, because the space of paths of fields is infinite However, the perturbation series for producing predictions can be defined just as for quantum mechan-ics, and this is how physicists make their predictions in practice. This perturbation series is organized in terms of Feynman diagrams (which are discussed in vertex operator algebras and the rules for computing them, completely solve the[IV.17](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras)).

always remains a symmetry of the same theory after quantization. The answer is some times no. Such a case One might wonder if a symmetry of a classical theory is known as an “anomaly.” Roughly speaking, this is because the measure of integration of the path integral is not preserved under the symmetry, but thisis a some what heuristic explanation because the path integral has no rigorous definition in general. Returning to our cubic example, if the interaction termφ3 has a coefficientλ, so that it is λφ3, then we organize the perturbation series as a power series in In terms of paths,

2.2.6 String Theory

Feynman’s perturbation theory has an important gener-al ization in string theory. String theory considers particles not as points but as loops. Instead of paths ofparticles through space-time, we get paths of loops,

which look like two-dimensional surfaces. String theory amplitudes are computed by summing over all surfaces. These sums are organized in a perturbation series in powers of the so-calledstant,λ^g. The power of λ^g in the perturbation series string coupling con- depends on the number of holes in the surface. The surfaces are called worldsheets. At each point of the worldsheet, its location in space-time is deter-mined by coordinates$X^{i}$. These coordinates them- selves depend on the location on the worldsheet. In effect, we get an auxiliary theory:
a field theory of coordinates on the two-dimensional surface! In string theory, even this two-dimensional field theory mustbe considered as a quantum field theory. The fields of the two-dimensional theory are maps from the sur-face to actual space-time. However, from the point of view of the worldsheet, the worldsheet itself is a two dimensional space-time and the maps are fields on space-time with values in some other (target) space.this study of these quantum field theories on two-dimen-Mirror symmetry was discovered as a result of the sional surfaces.
Subsequently, the same phenomenon was discovered in the case where the strings were not closed loops but filaments with endpoints. Both cases play an important role below. 3 Equivalence in Physics Mirror symmetry is a particular type of equivalence of quantum field theories. As we have seen, quantum field theories are rules for producing probabilities of physi-cal processes. In the path-integral formulation, probabilities are computed from correlation functions of fields. According to Feynman, these correlation functions can be thought of as being averages over all paths of fields.
Each path is weighted by expthe action of the path and is Planck’s constant. Let us$(i S/ )$, where S is denote the correlation function of some integrand theory A as Φ . Recall that Φ can depend on variousΦ in fieldsφi and points of space-time A xi, and the corre la- tion function will depend on all these and the action of theory$A$.φBi Equivalence, then, is a map from all possible fields such thatin a theory$A$to corresponding fields  ̃$φ^{i} \text{in a theory}Φ^{A} = Φ$ ̃B.

The particular case of mirror symmetry refers to an equivalence of quantum field theories on a two-dimensional surface. The most typical example of mirror sym-metry is the physical theory whose fields are mapsφ from a two-dimensional some target space, M . Such a theory is called a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces)sigmaΣ to model role of actual space-time, but for our purposes we can.
As we saw above, in string theory M plays the even consider the case where M is the real line R, so thatφ is an ordinary function. This case has already been studied in section 2.1.5. The action is given inequation (4). We can then write the partition function as

One first$τ = Zit$ (this is the Wick rotation), which leads to an imaginary Euclidean action i$S^{E}$. One then tries to evaluate the path integral in this framework, hoping that the answer willbe holomorphic [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). If it is, then one can use analytic continuation to work out the answer for ordi-nary time.

The combination of the two, along with the fact that this argument did not depend on the derivatives of the scaling parameterλ, leads to the statement of local scale invariance.

However, the quantum theory has no anomaly—meaning that the symmetry is preserved—if M is chosen to be a complex, calabi–yau manifold [III.6](/part - 03/calabiyau - manifolds). plex notion of orientation.
Recall that for an oriented manifold one can continuously choose, on each patch, The Calabi–Yau condition can be thought of as a coma basis for the tangent space such that, when we move from patch to patch, the determinant of the change of-basis matrix is equal to one. The same is true on a Calabi–Yau manifold, but now we consider complex bases for the complex tangent spaces. the instantons are complex analytic maps from the two-dimensional surface. Instantons are not “close” to the When the target manifold is a Calabi–Yau manifold, constant paths;

An instanton path could go fromx = −1 to x = +1, or vice versa.

Inaccessible by perturbation theory, instan3.1 Mirror Pairs In the setting above, we considered maps from a two-dimensional surfaceΣto a target (Calabi–Yau) space. Let us denote this quantum field theory by Q(M), which

In this setup, we say that the Calabi–Yau manifolds M and Wth rough the magic of mirror symmetry, hard problems are “mirror pairs” if Q(M) is equivalent to Q(W ).$in$ Q(M) involving instantons can be answered in Q(W ) by considering only the much simpler constant paths. 4 Mathematical Distillation A physical theory contains a tremendous amount of information.
For example, correlation functions can involve any number of fields, each evaluated at differ-ent points on the two-dimensional surface. This is typically too unwieldy a situation to approach mathemat i-cally. Instead, equipped with a symmetry of the theory called “supersymmetry,” a mathematical distillation can be performed. The distillation procedure is called topological twisting theory” has correlation functions that are independent, and the resulting “topological field of the positions of points.
Because of this independence, the correlation functions are certain characteris-tic numbers associated with the underlying geometric setup. In fact, there are two types of twisting, typically called A and B, which capture different aspects of the manifold in question.

4.1 Complex and Symplectic Geometry

4.1.1 Complex Geometry

To get a feel for the geometric aspect captured by topo-logical twisting, recall that we can construct the circle Sθ1+from the real line2π, and therefore also R by identifying the pointsθ +2πn, where n is any inte-θ and ger. What we have done is identified points related by a lattice of integer translations. We could choose the lattice to consist of multiples of some other real number rall scaling of, but since any two such lattices differ only by an over-R, we would effectively get the same space.
In the complex plane C, we can do the same thing with a two-dimensional lattice of translations generated bytwo complex numbers$λ^{1} and λ^{2}$, as long as the quo- tie nth as the same topology as any two-dimensional surfaceλ2/λ1 is not real. This space is called a torus and with one hole. It has more structure, however, because it can be covered by regions described by a complex coordinate—with different regions related by complexanalytic maps. The pairs(λ , λ ) and (λ , λ + λ ) generate the same lattice of translations, as do the pairs(λ , λ ) and (λ , -λ ).

That is, the theoryτ.

4.1.2 Symplectic Geometry

Another aspect of geometry is the which is described simply by an area element. Let ussize of the torus, recall that, topologically, all tori look like R2 with points identified by the lattice of integer horizontal and verti-cal translations (but not necessarily in a way that would respect any complex geometry). The points of the torus can be thought of as the unit square with opposite sides glued together. An area element in R2 looks like ρsquare.

That is, theρ.

4.2 Cohomological Theories

As you might imagine, the passage from an ordi-nary theory to a topological theory involves identifying

531

many aspects of the physical theory that were previ-ously distinct, such as different point values of a single field. Mathematically, a well-established method of pro-ducing topological aspects of a structure—and one that involves making identifications—is through aology theory [IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology). Cohomology theories follow co hom the pattern of having an operator tionδ ◦ δ = 0. We think of this equation as the state-δ obeying the equa- ment image is formed as the quotient(δ) ⊂ ker(δ).
The cohomology group H(δ) = ker(δ)/ image H(δ)(δ), which means that we identify any two vectors$v satisfying δu = δv =$0, so long as the differenceu andu - v can be written as δw for some w. Then H(δ) is just the space of all such vectors, up to identifications. The topological twisting of physical theories is similar. The operatorδ is a physical operator acting on a Hilbert space of states. The presence of super symme-try in our theories ensures thatδ exists and squares to zero. The vector states of the topological theory are just the elements of$Ψ obeying δΨ =H(δ)$0, up to identification.
In many cases,, i.e., states in the original theory these states can be identified with ground states. contains the complex translations of points on the two-dimensional surface. This means that the value of a It is crucial that supersymmetry is a symmetry that field operator valueφ(z^ ) at another. In other words, the physics ofφ(z)at one point is identified with its the topological theory is independent of the positions of the operators!
In the path-integral formulation, this means that the correlation functions are independent of the positions of the fields inserted into the integrand. What can they depend on, then? They depend on the particular field or combination of fields inserted, and they depend on the geometric parameter (such asρ orτ) of the space M.

4.2.1 The A-Model and the B-Model

Given a Calabi–Yau space, one can actually construct two zero. There are therefore two distinct corresponding operators,δ^A and δ^B, each of which squares to topological twistings and two distinct topological the-ories that can be constructed from a Calabi–Yau space. wonder if the topological models constructed from If M and Ware mirror Calabi–Yau pairs, you might them will still be equivalent theories.

For example, the Euler characteristic of one is the negative of the other. We emphasize here that the two manifolds may 5 Basic Example: T-Duality Although the circle is not complex, it provides avery illustrative entry into mirror symmetry that can be studied quite easily. We will find an equivalence between two theories constructed from circles.
The equivalence will be very nontrivial, however, as states of very different kinds will be shown to correspond. Consider the case where the two-dimensional surface is a cylinder, with spatial dimension a unit circle, andone dimension of time, and let us look at the sigma model (these were introduced in section 3). Suppose also that the target space is a circle of radius R, which we denote bytwo points identified if they differ by a multiple of 2(SR)1. We think of (SR)1 as the real line, withπR.
Maps from one circle to another can be classified by their winding number, an integer that tells you how many (net) times the image of a point goes around the second circle when the point goes once around the first. The mapnumbermθ. This allows us to write the field\to  m Rθ from the circle to (SR)1 has windingφ(θ) as a winding piece, winding):φ(θ)m Rθ= m Rθ, plus an honest Fourier series (no+ x + c . xp (inθ). Here we have singled out the constant mode Fourier series.
We have expanded just the(n. eq()0){n} x =θcdepend-0 of the ence in a series, so every continuous parameter (x and the well.cn) should be thought of as a function of time, as puted as in section 2.1.3: The energy, or Hamiltonian, of such a map is com H = (m R)2 + x ̇2$+ n |c$ ̇$n|^{2} + n^{2}|c^{n}|^{2}$.

In this example, the target space(R1)/R S1 is neither com- plex nor symplectic. As a result, we cannot construct the topological A- and B-models. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated the stronger statement that the two sigma models with target space S1 and S1 are equiva- lent.
The theories are mirror pairs. In the special case of circles, mirror symmetry is referred to as T-duality. In(R1)/R fact, the entire phenomenon of mirror symmetry—even for noncircles—can be deduced from T-duality.

5.2 The General Case

The torus is the only compact one-dimensional Calabi–Yau space and is therefore the simplest one, but the discussion above is part of a more general picture. The Calabi–Yau condition ensures a unique complex volume element, or orientation (dods” determine, and in turn vary with, the complexz, above), whose “per i parameters.
Though the A- and B-models both turn outto be rather simple in the case of the torus, what is important in general is that the B-model is completely determined by how the periods of the complex volume element (which were with the parameters of the theory (of which there wasλ1 and λ2 in section 4.1.1) change just one in section 4.1.1, namelyτ = λ /. ambda is quite simple for the torus, but more com-τ). Again, the relation plicated in general. In any case, this data gives all the information of the B-model.
The reason for all of this is2 1 that the instantons of the B-model turn out to be just the constant maps. Each point of the target space determines a constant map, and as a result the B-model is reduced to (classical) complex geometry of the target space. This is determined by the periods. This state of affairs is to be compared with the Amodel. The A-model depends on the symplectic param-etersρ, i.e., the areas of two-dimensional surfaces the details for simplicity.10. The parametersτ and ρ can also have real parts, but we neglect

533

inside the target space. In contrast to the B-model, however, the dependence onρ is very complicated, in general. The reason for this is that the instantons of the A-model are area-minimizing surfaces inside the target space, and their enumeration is a notori-ously challenging problem. (The problem is not terribly challenging for the torus, however.) Mathematically, the A-model instantons are described by the theory of Gromov–Witten invariants, the subject to which we now turn.
6 Mirror Symmetry and Gromov–Witten Theory As we mentioned above, the B-model onentirely by the classical complex geometry of W is explained W. The only relevant maps for B-model computations are the constant ones, so the space of such maps is equal tograls over W itself, and correlators reduce to (classical) inte-W . In fact, one of the integrands to be inte- grated is the complex volume element. Let us call the parameter for all possible complex volume elementsτ. B-model correlation functions are then determined byτ-dependent integrals over W .
In particular, the parti- tion functionso we write it as(ZB)(W )Z(W )of the B - model on(τ). W depends on τ, The main point about topological twisting is that B local variations of the fields are all identified, as they are related by the operatorδ. In particular, varying the point on the worldsheet is a trivial operation in the topological theory. It turns out that, for the B-model on W, only the constant maps contributed, but for the A-model the situation is a bit more subtle. To give a feel for the geometry, consider again the winding of a map from a circle to a circle.
Maps with different windings can never be deformed continuously into one another. The winding number is a measure of how the first circle “wraps” (or winds) around the target, according tothe map. Because it is a discrete parameter it cannot change under continuous variations. Likewise, whenis a higher-dimensional space, the two-dimensional sur-$M$ faceof MΣby different amounts. The parameters for wrap-can “wrap” around two-dimensional subspaces ping are again discrete. A mapφ can wrap Σ around the basic surfac esk .

The partition function can have contributions fromk but not on the continuous details of the map all classes. Different classes may contribute differently not only through the exponential weighting, but also$k$ in accordance with how many contain.

If you fix the boundary with a wire, the soap film will seek to find the minimumarea surface with that boundary.)

7.1 Nongeometric Theories

Mirror symmetry is about an equivalence of quantum field theories, and not every such field theory has the geometric content of a target space as in the sigma model. The structure involved in mirror symmetry—or at least its topological version—begins with a quantum theory with a supersymmetry algebra that allows for the passage to a topological theory. That is, there isa Hilbert space of states, a Hamiltonian operator, and a particular algebra of symmetries, i.e., operators that commute with the Hamiltonian.
There are no dictates as to how one constructs such a setup, and the sigma model of maps to a target space is only one such way. Other methods abound. The geometric case is merely the one most suited for mathematicizati on (and exposition), which is why we have focused on the theory witha target space. bly not—we will discuss the so-called orbifold theories.

These cone points would be trouble some in a quantum field theory, but the “stringy” orbifold is perfectly “smooth.”The orbifold theory itself carries a symmetry.

There is a symmetry corresponding to multiplication by 1 in the untwisted sector and by-1 in the twisted sector. This symmetry is not geomet-ric. Orbifold theories with symmetries can often themselves be orbifolded in such a way as to recover the orig-inal theory. In fact, the theory and its orbifold are also often mirror pairs! Greene and Plesser used such a con-struc tion to create the first examples of mirror pairs. Further more, they used ways of ascribing geometric interpretations to some non geometrically constructed which are the same as group elements when13.

Strings with ends are called “open strings,” while “closed strings” refers to loops. Mathematically, allow-ing ends corresponds to adding boundaries to the worldsheet surfaces.
With this addition, we would liketo perform the same topological twisting. To do so, we must first ensure that some supersymmetry con-dition persists when we put the boundary conditions on the fields. If we begin with a Calabi–Yau target man-ifold, we can ask to preserve the conditions that allow either the A-twisting or the B-twisting (but not both: the boundary condition will destroy some symmetry, much as pinning a rope will constrain its degrees of freedom). After the twist, the boundary topological theory will depend on symplectic or complex information, respectively.

The Lagrangian condition constrains half the coordinates; for linear spaces it is For the A-model, the endpoints or boundaries must like a restriction to the real part of a complex vector space. For the B-model the boundaries must lie on a complex space. Locally, a complex space looks like C$n$ and a complex subspace is described by complex analytic equations in the coordinates.

boundary theory, one appeals to the mathematical notion of a To package all the information of the topological category [III.8](/part-03/categories). A category is a way of talking about structure: it consists ofany pair of objects there is a space of objects morphisms, and for from one object to the other. Often the objects are mathematical structures of some kind and the morphisms from one object to another are the functions that preserve the relevant structure.
For example, if the objects are (i)spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), (iii) groups sets [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (iv)[I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (ii)vector spaces topological [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), or (v) chain complexes, then the morphisms are, respectively, (i) maps [I.2 §2.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar), (ii) continuous maps maps [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), (iii)[I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), or (v) chain maps.
The morphism spaces homomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (iv) linear between objects should be thought of as some kindof relational data. Morphisms themselves interact with one another, as they can be composed when the end object of one morphism is the start object of another. The composition is associative, so whether you com-puteabc as (ab)c or a(bc) does not matter. A use- ful image is a directed graph, which is a category with vertices as objects and paths between two vertices as morphisms. Composition is defined in this category by concatenating paths.

One can also imagine a cate- gorical definition that captures the structure of surfaces with handles and holes. Indeed, the proper mathematical framework for a complete understanding of mirror symmetry is still under construction.

We take the torus to have area element A dx dy, so that the symplectic parameter is the imaginary num - berρ = i A, as in section 4.1.2.
Now consider straight lines on the plane. These will correspond to closed cir-cles on the torus as long as they have rational slope: m = d/r , with d and r relatively prime integers. They are Lagrangian branes of the A-model boundary theory. The minimal-energy open strings connecting one line of slopem = d/r to another of slope m^ = d^ /r^ are those that have zero length. They are therefore the points of intersection. It is an easy exercise to show that there are|dr - r d | such points.

This is the same result as for our A-model calcu- lation above! Therefore, corresponding objects relate in a corresponding way. Beyond the morphism spaces, one checks finally that the compositions of correspond-ing morphisms correspond, just as for logarithms and slide rules. Doing so proves Kontsevich’s conjecture.

8.2 Definition and Conjecture

In fact, Kontsevich’s definition of mirror symmetry is really a conjecture stating that the boundary notion of mirror symmetry as an equivalence of categories is compatible with, and even implies, the traditional notion of mirror symmetry that relates Gromov–Witten theory and complex structures. One way to show this is to try to reconstruct the Gromov–Witten invariants from the boundary theory. A heuristic, geometric approach to doing so involves looking at the diagonal boundary condition in two copies of a space.
A disk mapping into two copies of a space is described by two maps of a disk into the space. Further, if the boundary condition is diagonal, this means that the maps have to agree on the boundary. What we have, then, is two disks inside a space which agree on the boundary. That is exactly what a sphere is: two disks (or cups) glued together! The disks are the two hemispheres, and they are glued torus. The rank is the dimension of that space. The degree is roughly a measure of the complexity of the bundle. For example, if we have a15.
A vector bundle assigns a vector space to each point of the two-dimensional surface and consider the bundle that assigns to each point the tangent space at that point, the degree is equal to 2$- 2g$, whereg is the number of holes on the surface.

along the equator. Now the minimal disks are instan-tons for the open string (with boundary), and by gluing them together along a common boundary, we have constructed a minimal sphere, or closed-string instanton. Thus the open string on this double theory should recover the closed string on the original theory. formations as deformations of the category of branes. A more algebraic approach sees the closed-string de That is, a change in bulk (nonboundary) theory induces a change in boundary theory.
But once equipped with a category, one can classify its deformations intrinsically. That is, if one views a category as a fancy algebra,16 then, as the deformations of an algebra are easily clas-sified through a notion called Hochschild cohomology, the deformations of a category can be treated similarly. One arrives at the maxim that the closed string is the Hochschild cohomology of the open string.
By comput-ing the Hochschild cohomology of a brane category, one can, in principle, check this maxim, establish Kontse-vich’s conjecture, and then prove the connection to traditional mirror symmetry and Gromov–Witten theory. 9 Unifying Themes How does one find mirror pairs construction?

Of course, one can attempt to mathematicize the physical argument, but that does not seem to lead to insights into the construction—perhaps because path integrals and other methods of quantum field theory such as renormalization are not very well understood mathematically. Batyrev has devised a procedure for constructing mirror pairs within the context of toric geometry. This method is a generalization, to a wide class of examples, of the original construction of Greene and Plesser. The recipe has been extremely successful in producing examples of every stripe.
However, the underlying meaning behind the construction is unclear. is a physical argument that makes contact with math-ematics, but it has not yet been made rigorous.

Therefore, choices of M of W from T , and recover W itself. M. So we can find the mirror to say about the structure of the Calabi–Yau spaces involved in mirror symmetry.
Specifically, the choices This construction is geometric and has something of a Lagrangian brane always look like a family of tori. Therefore, M itself should look like a family of tori. Further, one can argue that by performing T-duality infamilies of tori (in a similar way to how one does it for a single torus), one arrives back at the mirror manifold, W. This is what we did for the torus, thought of as a cir- cle family (member of the family, we found the mirror torus. So(SR()1)2) of circles (SR()1)1.
When we T-dualized each mirror symmetry is T-duality, and Calabi–Yau spaces of mirror symmetry should look like families of tori. This approach also relates to the homological mirror symmetry construction. Though promising, it remains mathematically elusive. Various points of view on mirror symmetry are helpful for different applications. To date, no unified under-standing of the phenomenon has been achieved. To some extent, we are still “feeling the elephant.” 10 Applications to Physics and Mathematics As a computational tool in string theory, mirror sym-metry is unparalleled in its power.
When combined with other physical equivalences, its power is multiplied. For example, there are certain equivalences in physics that relate one type of string theory to another. With out going into the details of string theory, we can get a flavor of its complexity by returning to mir-ror symmetry. Recall that the B-model was able to compute the difficult instantons on the A-model, yielding a great simplification of the two-dimensional quantum field theory on the worldsheet.
But this whole quantum field theory was just an auxiliary tool for computing some Feynman diagram for the perturb a-tion theory of the full string theory! Unfortunately, a satisfactory description of the full string theory path integral is, at the time of writing, way out of reach. String theory instanton effects are mostly unknown to us, unless a string equivalence or other argument can relate them to a perturbative effect in aent string theory. The perturbative string calculation differ-

Tracing through chains of equivalences in such a manner, many different phenomena in string theory can ultimately be calculated via mirror symmetry. perturbative and perturbative aspects of a single theory by outsourcing the calculations to equivalent theories In principle, one should be able to calculate all nonand exploiting mirror symmetry.
The barriers to doing this at the time of writing are largely technological, not conceptual. Beyond physics, the rich texture of mirror symmetry means that there is interesting mathematics to be discovered in the proper formulation of the problem. For example, defining the precise categories of branes in full generality remains a challenge. Yet there are also direct applications to mathematical questions. We have already discussed how enumerative geometry has been revolutionized by mirror symmetry and the counting of instantons. Results in symplectic geometry have also been obtained.
Occasionally, two objects may be proven to be equivalent as B-model branes. If the A-model mirrors can then be found, one has the result that the corresponding Lagrangian sub-spaces of the mirror symplectic space are also equivalent. Of course, to make such an argument, one must first prove Kontsevich’s version of mirror symmetry for the mirror pair considered. As a final recent example, Kapustin and Witten have found a relation of mirror symmetry to the geometric Langlands program in representation theory.
This program, loosely stated, is a correspondence between objects associated with two dimensional surfaces and Lie groups. From a surfaceΣ and a gauge group G, one constructs the space M of solutions to Hitchin’s equations. Central to that pro-gram are complex analytic objects on M that behave H nicely under the action of an algebra of operations. The Langlands correspondence relates two sets of such H objects: one easy to calculate and the other more dif-ficult. In fact M is itself a family of tori, and the easy objects correspond to points.
Mirror symmetry states that the points should turn into the tori under H T-duality, so the hard objects should correspond to the tori themselves! It is an appealing proposition, and making it precise mathematics will be difficult—but the gauntlet has been thrown down. The discovery that mirror symmetry relates to the geometric Langlands program has elicited great excitement among researchers and reveals yet another facet of this fascinating phenomenon.

1 Introduction

Algebra is the mathematics that places more emphasis on abstract structure than on intrinsic meaning. The conceptual simplifications that can result when context is stripped away from structure give algebra a special power and clarity compared with other areas: compare, for example, the difficulty of visualizing fourdimensional space with the triviality of manipulating quadruples this abstractness can also blind us. For instance, basic(x1, x2$, x3$, x4) of real numbers.
However, identities likeab = ba and a(bc) = (ab)c that are obeyed by numbers can be modified in count less directions, and each modification defines a new algebraic structure, but it is hard to guess from a purely abstract perspective which of these modifications will give rise to a rich, accessible, and interesting theory. For guidance, algebra has traditionally turned to geometry. For example, over a century agogested that the identities ab = −ba lie and[VI.53](/part - 06/sophus - lie - 18421899) sug - a(bc) =(ab)c + b(ac) were worth studying for geometrical rea - sons:
the resulting structures are now called lie algebras has joined geometry in this guiding role and has had[III.48 §2](/part - 03/lie - theory). More recently, as we shall see, physics spectacular success. The renowned physicist and mathematician Edward Witten believes that a major theme of twenty - first-century mathematics will be its reconciliation with the branch of physics known as quantum field theory. Conformal field theory (the quantum field theory that under lies string theory) is an especially symmetric and well-behaved class of quantum field theories.
When this notion is translated into algebra, the result is a struc-ture known as a vertex operator algebra (VOA). This

Vertex operator algebras are the algebra of string theory: they should be thought of as the same sort of gift to the twenty-first century that Lie algebras were to the twentieth. 2 Where VOAs Come From The two most revolutionary developments in physics inthe early twentieth century are usually held to be relativity and quantum mechanics.

To put this another way, the ultimate concern of relativity is grav-Unfortunately, nobody knows how to make relativity itation, and a direct application to gravity of the usual quantizing techniques fails.
This ought to mean that a fundamentally new physics arises at small distance scales that we are ignoring. Indeed, naive calculations suggest that the space-time “continuum” at distance scales of around 10-35 m should deteriorate into some sort of “quantum foam,” whatever that might mean.(10-35 m is extremely small: for instance, the order of magnitude of the size of an atom is 10$-10 m$.) proach to quantum gravity is string theory.

For reasons that we will sketch below, much of string theory reduces to studying confor-As the string moves, it traces out a surface called mal field theory, which is the induced quantum theory on these surfaces. Probably no other structures have affected so many areas of “pure” mathematics in so short a time as string theory and, what is essentially the same thing, conformal field theory. Indeed, five of the twelve Fields Medals awarded in the 1990 s (namely, those to Drinfel’d, Jones, Witten, Borcherds, and Kontsevich) were for such work.
We shall focus in this arti-cle on their algebraic impact; see mirror symmetry [IV.16](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) for some geometrical implications.

2.1 Physics 101

A quick over view of physics will be useful for the discussion. Further details can be found in mirror symmetry [IV.16 §2](/part-04/mirror-symmetry).

2.1.1 States, Observables, and Symmetries

A physical theory is a set of laws that govern the behav-ior of some kind of physical system. A state of that system is a complete mathematical description of the system at a particular time: for instance, if the system consists of a single particle, then we could take its state to be its positionx and momentum p = m(d/dt)x (where measurable quantity such as position, momentum, orm is its mass). An observable is a physically energy. It is through observables that a theory is com-pared with experiment.
Of course, for this to be true we also need to know what an observable is from a theoretical point of view. ical function of the state. For example, our single particle has energy In classical physics, an observable is just a numer-E, which depends on the posi- tion and momentum via a formula of the form$(1/2m)p^{2} + V (x)$. (This gives us the kinetic energy E = plus the potential energy.) Classical states at different times are related by the equations of motion, which are usually expressed as differential equations.
However, string theory and conformal field theory (CFT) are quantum theories, which are significantly different from classical theories: one can think of them as “applied linear algebra.” Where as a classical state was given by acollection of a few numbers (two, in the case of the particle above), a quantum state is an element of a hilbert space can think of as a column vector with infinitely many[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), which for the purposes of discussion we complex entries.

Symmetries in physical theories are highly desir-The symmetries of CFT are extremely rich, as we shall able because of two consequences that they have. First, they lead by noether’s theorem [IV.12 §4.1](/part - 04/analysis) to conserved quantities For example, the equations of motion of our particles, i.e., quantities independent of time. are usually invariant under translation: for instance, the gravitational force between two particles depends only on the difference between their positions.
The cor-responding conservation law in this case is the conservation of momentum. A second consequence of symmetries in quantum theories is that infinitesimal generators of the symmetries act on the state space$H$(the Hilbert space to which the states belong), forming a representation of the Lie algebra. Both consequences are important to CFT. 2.1.2 The Lagrangian Formulation and Feynman Diagrams We will need two of the languages in which physics is written. One is the Lagrangian formalism, which is IV.17.

The Lagrangian formalism can be expressed classically through Hamilton’s action principle.

The details are not important for us (and in any case are mathematically dubious in general).
the intuition behind the path integral formulation is that the particle simultaneously follows every one of those histories, and each of them contributes to the probability.as$\to \text{is called}$0, the contribution from the path that satisfies Planck’s constant ; in the “classical limit” Hamilton’s principle dominates everything else. The main use of Feynman’s path integral is in perturbation theory. Finding exact solutions in physics is typi-cally impossible and rarely useful. In practice, it suffices to find the first few terms in some Taylor expansion ofthe solution.
This so-called “perturbative” approach to quantum theories is particularly transparent in Feyn-man’s formalism, where each term of the expansion can be represented pictorially as a graph. See figure 1(a)for typical examples. The graphs contributing to the nnth-order term in this Taylor expansion will involve vertices. Feynman’s rules describe how to convert these graphs into integral expressions for computing the individual terms in the Taylor expansion. In this article we are interested in perturbative string theory.
The string Feynman diagrams (see figure 1(b)for three equivalent ones) are surfaces called worldsheets these surfaces are much less singular than the particle; the need for quantum foam is avoided because graphs (which have singularities at each vertex), and this is also largely why the mathematics of strings is so nice.
To cut a long story short, each term in the per-tur ba tive expression for probabilities in string theory can be calculated from a quantity called a “corre la-tion function” in a CFT that lives on the corresponding 541 (a) (b) Figure 1(a) particles and (b) strings.

The corresponding rules of string theory tell us that we should dissect the worldsheet into “tubular Y - shapes,” or spheres with three legs, as in figure 2.

This again has the anti-commuting property-[B,ˆA]ˆ and again satisfies the Jacobi identity, so the[A,ˆB]ˆ$=$ process of “quantization” gives rise to a homomor-phism of Lie algebras. The derivative with respect to time of a quantum observable ˆlogue of the classical case:

Thus the Hamil- tonian has a dual role: as the energy observable and asthe controller of time evolution. All of physics is stored in the action of the observables on state space H , as well as the commutators of these observables with ˆLet us illustrate this picture with the quantum spring H., also known as the harmonic oscillator. The position and momentum observables ˆthe infinite-dimensional space$x$, ˆp are operators acting on H of possible spring- states.
It is more convenient to work with certain combi-nations of them called ˆ$a$and ˆa† (the dagger denotes the “Hermitian adjoint,” or complex-conjugate transpose), which obey the commutator relation[a,ˆ$a$ˆ$†] = I$, where Iobservables can be built from ˆis the identity operator.

In this algebraic way we can recover all of the physics. This idea of building up the whole space H from the vacuum and the operators is a fruitful one in mathematics as well:
something similar happens for the most important modules of most of the important Lie algebras.

The values taken by at her more, a quantum field is not a quantum field are operators; fur-function of space and time, but a more general object called a[III.18](/part-03/distributions). The prototypical example of a distribution is the distribution Dirac delta functionδ(x - a). Despite its name, this is not a function: rather, it is defined by the property that

f (x) δ(x - a) dx = f (a) (1)

for any sufficiently well-behaved function thoughδ(x - a) is not a function, one can informallyf (x). Even interpret it as the derivative of a step function, andone can visualize it as equaling 0 every where except at x = a, where it is infinite, in such a way that the infinitely tall and infinitely thin rectangle under the graph has area 1. However, it really only makes sense inside an integral, as in (1). Similar remarks apply to

distributions in general, so a quantum field can really only be evaluated inside an integral of space and time, applied to some “test function” likeof such an integral will be an operator on the statef above. The value space H. takes Poisson brackets of classical fields. Similarly, commutators of quantum fields involve delta functions Dirac deltas appear in classical mechanics when one too.
For example, in the simplest cases the quantum fieldsφ satisfy[φ(x, t), φ(x$, t)] = 0, \}|\}φ(x, t)$, . artial t. artial φ(x$, t) = i δ(x - x)$.⎪⎭ (2) This is a mathematical way of expressing, in the context of quantum field theory, the cherished physical principle called locality:1 the only way we can directly affect something is by nudging it. In order to influence some-thing not touching us, we must propagate a disturbance from us to it, such as a ripple in water. The main pur-pose of both classical and quantum fields is that they provide a natural vehicle for realizing locality.
Localityis also at the heart of vertex operator algebras. An important aspect of modern physics is that many of the central concepts of classical physics become less central, and are instead derived quantities. For example, the basic object ofa Lorentzian manifold, and familiar physical quantities general relativity [IV.13](/part - 04/general - relativity - and - the - einstein - equations) is such as mass and gravitational force are, from the point of view of this manifold, just names (that are not wholly precise) given to certain of its geometrical features. Particles are obviously essential
to classical physics, but we have not mentioned them in our brief sketch of quantum field theory. They arise through the so-called modes of quantum fieldsφ, which play the role of the operators ˆ$a$, ˆa† that we met in section 2.1.3. A mode is the operator that results from hitting the quantum field with an appropriate test function and integrating—just as one does when working out a Fourier coefficient, in which case the test functions are trigonometric functions [III.92](/part - 03/trigonometric - functions). In fact, when viewed appropriately, modes actually kind.
The commutators of these modes can be obtained are Fourier coefficients of a certain from the commutators of the fields. Now, recall that the vertex operators of string theory are related to the not even light can connect two given space-time points, then the quan-tum fields at those points must be causally independent. In particular,1. More precisely, for quantum fields, locality takes the form that if measurements at such points can be performed simultaneously with arbitrary precision. In quantum theories, this requires those operators to commute.
Equation (2) is a generous way to satisfy locality. 543 emission and absorption of strings. As we shall see shortly, these vertex operators are the quantum fields in a quantum field theory of point particles (namely, the associated conformal field theory); the modes of these vertex operators generate the “particles” (or in more conventional language, themal field theory. Equivalently, they generate the various states) in that con for vibrational states of a single string in that string theory.

We shall explain is enough to know that a CFT is a particularly symmet-rical kind of quantum field theory. A CFT lives on the worldsheet some times colliding and separating, through time.

This is eas-iest to see in the context of string theory: the ripples CFT, like any quantum field theory in two dimenon the string are responsible for the physical proper-ties (charge, mass, etc.) of the corresponding state, but they can move (at the speed of light) either clockwiseor counter clockwise around the string. When they do so, they just pass through each other with out inter-acting. These two alternatives, clockwise and counter clockwise, yield the two CFT, one first analyzes its chiral halves and then splices chiral halves of CFT.
To study a them together to form the “bichiral” physical quanti-ties. Almost all attention in CFT by mathematicians has focused on the chiral (as opposed to physical) data, and indeed that is where vertex operator algebras live. For ease of presentation, we will usually suppress one of the chiral halves. A conformal transformation is a transformation that preserves angles. The simplest reason one can give for why two dimensions are so special for CFT is that there are far more conformal transformations in two dimensions than there are in higher dimensions.
When n >bi nations of translations, rotations, and enlargements.2 the only examples are the obvious ones: com This means that the space of all local conformal trans-formations in R(nn)+2 nis far richer: it is= 2 the space of local conformal transformations isinfinite2 dimensional.

Since and there are many conformal transformations, a CFTis especially symmetrical: this is what makes CFTs so interesting mathematically. Lie algebras arise naturally whenever one has local symmetries, and indeed one can form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra out of the infinitesimal conformal transformations. This algebra has a basis that obeys the Lie-bracket relationsln, n \in  Z,[lm, ln] = (m - n)lm+n. (3)

The algebraic interpretation of the conformal symmetry of CFT turns out to be that these basis elements act naturally on all the quantities in the theory, as we$l^{n}$ shall explain below. The basic example that under lies all the others is when space-time sponding to an in coming string. It is parametrized byΣis a semi-infinite cylinder corretimet < 0 and the angle 0 ⩽ θ < 2π around the string. We can conformally map the cylinder to the punctured disk in C byz = (et()-i)θ, so t = −$\infty$ corresponds toz = 0. This allows us to say what we mean by conformal symmetries of the cylinder.

An\in  Z)n typical field bin at i on of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic fields,φ(z)is not holomorphic: rather, it is a com which make up the two chiral halves of CFT. We will focus on the space of holomorphic fieldsφ(z), which we call V.
This turns out to form a vertex operator algebra (as do the anti-holomorphic fields).For example, the most important vertex operator comes directly from the conformal symmetry: the stress-energy tensor T (z) ∈ Vis the “conserved current” that Noether’s theorem associates with the conformal symmetry. Labeling its modes (Noether’s

Instead, they form a so-called tive representation The operators$Ln$. Projective representations of sym-do not precisely represent the con-projec- me tries, such as (4), are common in quantum theories. The fact that they are not true representations is not a problem, since one can turn them into true re pre sen-tat i ons by extending the algebra. In our case, the state space Virasoro algebra H carries inside it a true representation of the Vir, which is useful as it means Vir can be used to organize H.

As with everything else, the quantum prob-abilities arising in CFT are found by first computing chiral quantities and splicing them together. These chiral quantities are called are found using simple Feynman-like rules applied toconformal or chiral blocks, and dissections like figure 2. In rational CFT we get a finite-dimensional space F of chiral blocks for any world- sheet of punctures.
These spaces carry projective re pre sen-Σ, i.e., for any choice of genusg, n g and number n tat i ons of the mapping class group the fundamental groupπ of the moduli spaceΓg, n(defined to be M ). This Jones’s relation of theΓg, n-representation is the source, for instance, of braid group1 [III.4](/part-03/braid-groups) (and henceg, n knots [III.44](/part-03/knot-polynomials)) to subfactors, Borcherds’s explanation of “Monstrous Moonshine,” the Drinfel’d–Kohno mon-odromy theorem, and the modularity of affine Kac Moody characters. Some of this we will touch on in section 4.
The most important example here is the torus, where the chiral blocks are functions of fundamental mathematical importance. Amodular functions, a class of modular function is a meromorphic function (that is, a function that is holomorphic except at a few “poles” where it can tend to infinity)the upper half-plane H= {τ \in  f (τ)C | Imthat is defined onτ > 0} and that is “symmetric” with respect to the group SL2(Z) of 2 . imes 2

We shall discuss this further in section 3.2.The appearance of modularity can be understood by recalling from section 2.1.2 that Feynman’s path inte-gral in string theory is an integral over moduli spaces. The moduli space the quotient of the half-plane M1^,0 for the torus can be written as H by the action of SL (Z).
Therefore, if one lifts the integrand of Feynman’s inte-gral from M to H, one obtains a function Z(τ)2 that is invariant under Sl grand Z(τ)1 is a quadratic combination of the chira(l,()0){2}(Z) and hence modular. This inte- blocks for the torus. 3 What VOAs Are It is possible to give a fully axiomatic definition of ver-tex operator algebras. However, when one first encounters this definition (and not just the first time either)it can seem very complicated and arbitrary, and one is given no feel for the importance of VOAs. Our treatment below will be much more in formal:
this will clarify their importance even if it hides much of their complexity. Thanks to the previous section, it is possible to givea quick justification for VOAs: if you concede that CFT (or equivalently, perturbative string theory) is important, and if you have seen how closely related CFT is to VOAs, then you must concede that VOAs are important. However, this is not the whole story, as we shall see. 3.1 Their Definition Let us begin by defining them in terms of other con-cepts that must themselves be defined:
a vertex operator algebra is an algebra of vertex operators, or in other words the chiral algebra Vof a conformal field theory. The most important thing to understand in this definition is that a vertex operator is a quantum field, which, as we have seen, is an “operator-valued distribution of space - time.” So we can think of it informally as a matrix-valued function of space - time, where the matrix is. nfty . imes. nftyand its entries can be generalized functions like the Dirac delta (1). However, we shall give a much better description of these vertex operators shortly.

running along the axis: the map from this to the punc-tured disk was(θ, t) \to z = (et()-i)θ. We want to restrict our attention to quantum fields that depend holomor-ph ically on$z$. However, it is not obvious what “holomorphic” means for distributions. We touched on this question in section 2.2: now we shall look at it in more detail. To do this, we need a more concrete description of a vertex operator. The key idea is a very convenient algebraic interpretation of holomorphic distributions.

Consider the sum

$d(z) = n=−\infty\infty z^{n}$. (5)

Multiply it by$f (z) = 3z^{-2} - 5z^{3}$, say. This gives usf (z)d(z) = 3 n=−$\infty$. nfty zn-2 - 5 n=−$\infty$. nfty zn+3 = 3 n=−$\infty$. nfty zn - 5 n=−$\infty$. nfty zn = −2 d(z). A few more examples like this will convince you thatf (z)d(z) = f (1)d(z) for any polynomial function f ofz and z-1. Therefore, d(z) behaves exactly like the Dirac deltaδ(z - 1), at least for polynomial test func- tions positive powers have a convergent sum only forf .

The most important state in the theory is the vacuum$Y (|0 |$, z)0. It corresponds to the identity vertex operator:= I. From the physical point of view, the ver- tex operator$v \text{at time} t = −\infty Y (v$, z), i.e., is the field that created the state Y (v, 0)|0 exists and equals v .

This equation may look strange. Why can we not sim-ply divide out the(z - n)N and get that all vertex operators commute? The reason is that when formal power series are involved, there can be zero divisors. For example, it is easy to check that0. Locality in the form (7) is at the heart of VOAs;(z - 1)n \in Z zn = for instance, one can express it as a triply infinite sequence of identities that the modes must obey, and this emphasizes just how restrictive a condition itis, and how correspondingly interesting it is to find examples of VOAs.

We have emphasized their physical origins A VOA is simultaneously a physical and a mathematin order to help explain the motivation for studying them. We know they should be valuable to mathematics, simply because CFT is, and indeed this is the case, as we shall see in section 4. But from a purely mathematical point of view, they might appear somewhatad hoc, as though we had a list of mathematical ingredients and said to ourselves, “Let’s consider this, and then have some of these, oh, and perhaps one of those too, but with the following extra assumption: . . .
.” For-tunately, there are more abstract formulations of VOAs that make them appear much less arbitrary as mathe-mat ical structures. For example, Huang has shown that they can be regarded as “two-dimensionalized” Lie alge-bras, in the following sense. If you want to keep track of the Lie brackets in an expression such as(which is important since the Lie bracket is not an asso-[a, [[b, c], d]] cia tive operation), you can do so with the help of a binary tree, and in fact it is easy to formulate Lie algebras in the language of such trees.
If one then replaces binary trees by diagrams made out of spheres with legs, as we did with Feynman diagrams earlier, one obtains a structure that is equivalent to a VOA. (Of course, this is very far from a full explanation of what Huang did: his proof is extremely long.) 547 3.2 Basic Properties We see from the definition sketched in the last subsec-tion that a VOA is an infinite - dimensional Z+-graded vector space with infinitely many products (namely$u* v = u (v))$, which obey infinitely many identities.
Need less to say, it is not an easy definition, and there are no easy examples.$n^{n}$ the conformal vector However, if we ignore the conformal symmetry (i.e.,ω), then there are some sim- ple, though uninteresting, examples.

The converse of this statement is true too: any such algebra is a VOA that obeys (7) with N = 0. In these simple examples, the role of the derivation T is to recover the z-dependence of the vertex operator. want interesting examples. Likewise, the vertex oper-ators Therefore, we need Y (u, z) must be distributions (that is, they must N not to be zero in (7) if we involve doubly infinite sums) or again the VOA reduces to a commutative associative algebra.

We shall not give full details here, but, roughly speaking, it is a space on which V acts in such a way that as much as possible of the VOA structure isrespected. For example, V will automatically be a mod- ule for itself, just as a group acts on itself in a sim-ple way.
(See representation theory [IV.9 §2](/part - 04/\text{representation} - theory) for an explanation of the latter.) A rational VOA is defined to be one that has the simplest representation theory: it has only finitely many irreducible V - modules, and548 any V -module is a direct sum of irreducible ones. They are called rational VOAs because they are the Voas that come from rational CFT. For these VOAs, V acts irreducibly on itself. Assume now that V is rational.

The lengthy theory, and owes much to the intuitions of rational CFT.In the next section, we shall get some idea of why it is so important. 4 What Are VOAs Good For?
This section describes what are probably the two most significant applications of VOAs. But let us begin by listing (with out any explanations) a few others. Inspired by the geometry of string theory, vertex operator (super)algebras have been assigned to manifolds, resulting in a powerful, though complicated, algebraic invariant of those manifolds that generalizes and enriches more classical data such as de Rham cohomology. VOAs associated with affine Kac–Moody algebrasat “degenerate” levelsk are deeply related to the geo- metric Langlands program.
The modularity of affine algebra characters, as well as that of, for example, lattice theta functions, are all special cases of Zhu’s theo-rem, which places these modularities in a much broader context.

4.1 The Mathematical Formulation of CFT

Since the 1970 s quantum field theory has had con-sider able success, especially in geometry, by studying

IV. Branches of Mathematics

classical structures using infinite-dimensional meth-ods; this is a theme in particular of Atiyah’s school. Conformal field theories are a class of exceptionally symmetric quantum field theories, and they are also among the simplest nontrivial quantum field theo-ries known. In the past two decades mathematics has feasted on this combination of symmetry and (relative)simplicity, often by “looping” or “complexifying” more classical structures, and the impact of CFT (or, equiva-lently, of string theory) has been especially significant and broad.
In hindsight the importance of CFT to mathematics is not surprising: it is a coherent and intri-cate structure that straddles several disparate areas of mathematics, sprawling across geometry, number theory, analysis, combinatorics, and indeed algebra. theory has been to CFT itself. Quantum field theories From this point of view, a crucial application of VOA are notoriously difficult to put on a rigorous mathe-mat ical footing.
But the successful applications suggest that these difficulties are a symptom of mathemat i-cal profundity and subtlety rather than of irreparable mathematical incoherence. In this sense the situation is highly reminiscent of the deep conceptual challenges to eighteenth-century mathematicians that were raised bycalculus. The definition of a VOA by Richard Borcherds makes the chiral algebra of a CFT completely rigorous, as well as concepts like the operator product expansion. Subsequent work (especially by Huang and Zhu) reconstructs from the VOA more and more of the CFT, in arbitrary genus.
The resulting clarity makes the whole subject more accessible to, and hence exploitable by, mathematicians. Quantum field theories are here to stay in mathematics, and thanks to VOAs mathemat i-cians are absorbing a large class of them completely and explicitly.

4.2 Monstrous Moonshine

In 1978 Mc Kay noticed that 196 884$\approx 196 883$. Why was this an interesting observation? Well, the number on the left is the first meaningful coefficient of the function [IV.1 §8](/part-04/number-theory)j - j(τ) = q - 1 + (744+)196 884 q + 21 493 760 q2 + 864 299 970 q3 + · · ·, (10)

the generator of all modular functions for SL2(Z). Recall that a modular function is a functionis meromorphic in the upper half-plane H and invari-f (τ) that ant under the usual action of SL2(Z). It should also be

meromorphic at the boundary points Q∪ i. nfty, which are called lier. Thejcusps-function generates these functions in the; we did not mention this condition ear sense that any such modular function written as a rational function poly(j(τ))/f (τ)poly can be(j(τ)). In other words, identifies(H ∪ Qj(τ)∪ is a uniformizing function thati. nfty)/SL (Z) with the Riemann sphere C∪. nfty.
We bracketed the constant term 744 in2 (10) because although 744 was the traditional choice itcan be freely replaced with any other number, including 0.The number on the right in Mc Kay’s observation is the dimension of the smallest nontrivial representation of the Monster, the most exceptional of theple groups [V.7](/part - 05/the - classication - of - finite - simple - groups). This relation between modular func-finite sim tions and the Monster was completely unexpected, asthey seem to occupy completely independent spots in the mathematical universe.
Conway, Norton, and others fleshed out and expanded Mc Kay’s original obser-vation by making a number of conjectures, collectively called pair(g, h)Monstrous Moonshineof commuting elements in the Monster (a. For instance, with every group of size about 8$\times 1053)$, we expect there to be associated a function ular functions for some discrete sub gr oupj(g, h)(τ) that generates all mod-Γ(g, h) of$SL$ g =2(Zh)=. The identity.j-function would be assigned in the case The first major step toward proving these Moonshine conjectures was made by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meur-man in the mid 1980 s.
They constructed an infinite dimensional vector space V% out of formal power series. They were motivated on the one hand by the vertex operators of string theory, and on the other by the formally similar distributions used in constructing affine algebra representations. This seemed a promising direction since for both string theory and affine algebra representations modular functions arise naturally. Together with a rich algebraic structure that came from these “vertex operators,” V\\\% was also acted on in a natural way by the Monster group.
More over, although V%is infinite dimensional, it comes packaged into finite-dimensional pieces“graded dimension”. im (VV%)q% =n equals . nf tyn=−1 j V-n %, and the744. The action of the Monster sends each each space V% itself carries a representation of th(en)n (Vn)%to itself; that is, Monster. Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman proposed that V% lies at the heart of the Monstrous Moonshinen conjectures. tween Borcherds was struck by the formal similarity be-V% and the chiral algebras of CFTs, and by

549

abstracting out their important algebraic properties he defined a new structure called a vertex (operator) algebra. His axioms clarified their relationship with (generalizations of) Kac–Moody algebras, and by 1992 he had proved the main Conway–Norton conjecture (which corresponds to the case wheretrary buth is the identity in the conjecture giveng is arbi- earlier).
Although his definition of VOAs required a deep understanding of the physics of CFT, his elab-orate proof of this Moonshine conjecture is purely algebraic. We would now call V% a rational VOA with only one irreducible module (namely itself); its symmetry group is the Monster and its character (8) is j(τ) - 744. The removal of the constant term 744 from (10) is signifi-cant as it says that the Lie algebra V%is trivial—this is necessary if the symmetry group is to be finite. It is con-jectured that V% is the unique VOA with central charge1 c = 24, trivial V1, and only one irreducible module.
This is meant to be reminiscent of the[I.4 §4](/part - 01/general - goals), which is known to be the unique twenty-four-leech lattice dimensional even self-dual lattice with no vectors of$\sqrt{}$ length in the construction of2. Indeed, the Leech lattice plays a crucial role$V^{\\\%}$. Most of the Moonshine conjectures are still open and this deep connection between modular functions andthe Monster is still some what mysterious. At the time of writing, however, VOAs still provide the only serious approach to the Moonshine conjectures.
Borcherds defined VOAs to clarify the chiral algebra of CFT and to tackle Monstrous Moonshine. For this work, he was awarded a Fields Medal in 1998.

1 Introduction

enumeration est mathematical subject, while algebraic combinator-, otherwise known as counting, is the oldics is one of the youngest. Some cynics claim that alge-braic combinatorics is not really a new subject but just a newics in order to enhance its (former) poor image, but name given to enumerative combinator algebraic combinatorics is in fact the synthesis of two opposing trends: abstraction of the concrete and concretization of the abstract the first half of the twentieth century, starting with.
The former trend dominated Hilbert’s “theological” proof of the fundamental the-orem of invariants, in which he showed by abstract means that certain invariants existed, but not how tofind them. The latter trend is dominating contemporary mathematics, thanks to the omnipresence of The Mighty Computer.
conceptualizati on(in short, The abstraction trend consists of the“bourbakization”, structuralizati on[VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935)) of mathematics., and categorization fancification, Enumeration did not escape this trend, and in the hands of such giants as Gian-Carlo Rota and Richard Stanley in America and Marco Schützenberger and Dominique Foata in France, classical, enumerative combinatorics became more conceptual, structural, and algebraic. However, as algebraic combinatorics has established itself as a fully fledged and separate mathematical speciality, the more recent trend
toward the cre te, and constructive has left its mark as well. It has explicit, con revealed that many algebraic structures have hidden combinatorial underpinnings; the attempts to unearth these have led to many fascinating discoveries and unsolved problems.

1.1 Enumeration

The fundamental theorem of enumeration, indepen-dently discovered by several anonymous cave dwellers, states that

$|A| = a \in^{A} 1$.

In words: the size of the union of two disjoint sets equals the sum of their sizes.

$|A \times B| = |A| · |B|$.

In words: the size of the Cartesian product of two sets(that is, the set of all pairs(a, b), where a \in  A andb \in  B) equals the product of their sizes.|AB| = |A(||()B){|}.

In words: the size of the set of functions from equals the size of A raised to the power the size of B to BA.

yields answer (ii).

2.3 Recursion

Suppose that that it is a combination of fundamental operations An can be decomposed in such a way applied to the setsa recurrence relation of the form(An)-1$, (An)-2,$. . . , A0. Then ansatisfies an = P (an - 1$, an - 2,$. . . , a0). sequence insequence must add up to For example, let An starts with a 1, then the rest of the An be the set of example (iv). If an - 1, and if it starts with a 2, then the rest must add up to n - 2.
Since when n ⩾ 2 exactly one of these possibilities occurs and both are possible, we can decompose A into 1 A- and 2 A-,$where 1$(An)-1 is shorthand for the set of all sequence(sn()n()1()n)2 that begin with a 1 and continue with a sequence in(An)-1, and 2(An)-2 is defined similarly.
Since the sizes of 1 that An^-a1 and 2= a A-n^-+2 aare clearly^- , which yields answer (iii).(an)-1 and (an)-2, it follows (example (iii)), then a typical legal bracketing can be written recursively as If(An)n is the set of legal bracketings wit(hn()1()n)2 [L ]L , where L andn L pairs are smaller (possibly empty) legal bracketings. For exam - ple, if the bracketing is 1[ [ ] [ ] ] [ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] (]2()1)2 then Lthen1 = L[ ] [ ]hasandn - L21 -= k[ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ]pairs. It follows that.

For example, iff (x) that can be translated back into infor - a = a = 1 and following manipulations onan = an - 1 + an - 2 whenf (x)n ⩾ 2, then we can do the:
0 1 f (x) =n. nfty = 0 anxn = a0 + a1 x + n. nfty = 2 anxn = 1 + x + n. nfty = 2(an - 1 + an - 2)xn = 1 + x + n. nfty = 2 an - 1 xn + n. nfty = 2 an - 2 xn = 1 + x + xn. nfty = 2 an - 1 xn - 1 + (x2)n. nfty = 2 an - 2 xn - 2 = 1 + x + x(f (x) - 1) + x2 f (x)= 1 + (x + x2)f (x).

It follows that

$f (x) = 1 - x1 - x^{2}$.

If one performs a partial-fraction decomposition, and expands the two resulting terms in a Taylor series, then one can obtain answer (i) to example (iv). 3 Weight Enumeration According to the modern approach, pioneered by Pólya, Tutte, and Schützenberger, generating functions are neither “generating,” nor are they functions. Rather, they areators of combinatorial sets. (Usually, but not always, formal power series that are weight enumerthese sets are infinite:
for a finite set the corresponding“power series” has only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore a polynomial.)A power series. nfty  a xn is called formal when one sheds its analytical connotation as a Taylor series of a function, and there by obviates the need to worry about n = 0 n convergence. For example, the sum fect ly legal as a formal power series even though it$n = 0 n$!n!xn is per- converges only when$x = 0$. As for weight enumerators, consider the following situation. Suppose that we want to study the age distri-bution of a finite population.
One way of doing this is to ask 121 questions. For eachi between 0 and 120, we ask those whose age is count each of these age-groups one by one, compilingi to raise their hand. Then we

$f (x) = {}^{1}20 a x^{i}$.i

But if the size of the population is much less than 120, itis much more efficient, because fewer questions would$i = 0$ be needed, to ask every person their age and then to declare the weight of a person of agei to be xi. Then the generating function is the sum of these weights. That is,

f (x) = xag(e()person),

persons

which is a natural extension of the caveman’s formula of naive counting. Once we knowf (x) we can eas- ily compute statistically interesting quantities, like the average and the variance, which work out to be$\mu = f (1)/f (1) and σ^{2} = f (1)/f (1)+\mu-\mu^{2}$, respectively. (finite or infinite) combinatorial set, let us call ita certain numerical The general scenario is that we have anattribute,α: A \to  N, which assigns interesting A, and to each element of A a natural number. (Here we allow 0 as a natural number.) Then the A with respect to αis defined by the formula weight enumerator of

f (x) = x^α(a).

We shall also use the notation this equals$a \in^{A}|A|^{x} for f (x)$. Obviously,. nftyanxn,

Hence if we have some kind of exp li citn=0 A whose expression for expression for the actual sequencef (x), we immediately have an “explicit”$a^{n} assuming$, that$is$, that one considers the operations needed to calcu-late thenth coefficient a of f (x) as constituting an explicit expression foris still often possible to get a “nice” formula for(an)n. Even if one does not, then itan, or, failing this, to extract the asymptotics. The fundamental operations for naive counting also hold for For example, weighted counting:
just replace| · | by | · |x$.|A ∪ B|x = |A|x + |B|x (if$ A ∩ B = ∅) and|A . imes B|x = |A|x · |B|x.

Let us quickly see why the second of these is true. If the members ofcal attributesα and A andβ, respectively, and one defines an B are endowed with numeri- 553 attributeγ on A . imes B by letting γ(a$, b) equal α(a)+β(b)$, then

|A . imes  B|x = xγ(a, b)=(a, b)\in A. imes B xα(a()+)β(b)(a, b)\in A. imes B= xα(a) · xβ(b)(a, b)\in A. imes B= xα(a) · xβ(b)a. um \in  A)b\in B . um= xα(a) · ·xβ(b)= |Aa|\in x)A· |B|x$.b \in B$

Let us see how these facts can be useful. First, consider theand 2 s, and let the attribute be “sum of entries.” then infinite set$A$, of all (finite) sequences of 1 s the weight of 1221 isa sequence(a · · · a x)6 is, and, in general, the weight ofxa^+···+a. The set A can benaturally decomposed as1(r1)k A = {φ} ∪ 1 A ∪ 2 A,

whereφ is the empty word, and 1 A is short for the set of all sequences obtained by prefixing a 1 to members of A, and analogously for 2 A. Applying | · | , we getx|A|x = 1 + x|A|x + x2|A|x,

which, in this simple case, can be solved yield, once again explicitly, to

$|A|^{x} = 1 - x1 - x^{2}$.

the weight is noted, it can be written as A legal bracketing$x^{0} = L1)$, or else, as we have already is either empty (in which case L = [L ]L , where L and LL2 are (shorter) legal bracketings. Conversely, whenever and L are legal bracketings, so is1 [L2 ]L . Let1 L be the (infinite) set of weight of a legal bracketing to be1 2 all legal bracketings, and define the$xn$, wher(e1)2 n is the number of bracket pairs[ ] is x and the weight of[ ][ [ ] [ [ ] [ ] ] ]. For example, the weight ofis x5. The set L decomposes naturally as follows:

$L = {φ} ∪ ([L] \times L)$,

whereφ denotes the empty word and [L] × L denotes the set of all words of the form L in L. This leads to the nonlinear[L(in fact, quadratic)1]L2 with L1 and$equation2$|L|x = 1 + x|L(|2)x,

which yields, thanks to the Babylonians, the explicit expression$\sqrt{}|L|x = 1 - 21x - 4x$.

This in turn gives us the answer to example (iii) above, via Newton’s binomial theorem. trees vertex has either no children or exactly two chil-Legal bracketings are equivalent to so-called, that is, unlabeled ordered trees where every binary dren. For instance, when we write the legal bracketing[ [ ] [ ] ] [ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ] in the form [L1]L2 we can think$of$ L [ [ ] [ ] ] [ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ]= [ ] [ ] and L = [ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ]as the parent, with children. Then L’s children are1φ and [ ], while2 L2’s are[ ] and [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ]1.

Nowadays such sums can be handled completely matically, and if one inputs this sum to the Maple au to package EKHAD (downloadable from my Web site), one would get the recurrence$w = w + (n - 1)w$ as the output, together with a (completely rigorous!)(nn()-1()n)-2 proof. While the so-called Wilf–Zeilberger (WZ) method is able to handle many such problems, there are many other cases where one still needs a human proof. In either case such proofs involve (algebraic, and some times analytic)rialist Adriano Garsia derogatorily calls such proofs manipulations.

Indeed, according equivalence classes, where the equivalence relation [I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar) is “is in bijective correspondence with.” Saharon Shelah said that people have been exchanging objects, in a one - to-one way, since long before they started to count. Also, a bijective proof explains why the two sets are equinumerous, as opposed to just certifying the formal correctness of this fact.
For example, suppose that Noah had wanted to prove that there were as many male as female creatures in his Ark. One way of proving this would have been to count the males and count the females, and check that the two resulting numbers were indeed the same. But a much better, conceptual, proof would have been to note that there is an obvious one - to - one correspondence between the set M of males and the set Fof females: the function bijection, with inverse w:$M \to \text{Fdefined byh}$: F \to w(x)Mdefined by= Wife Of(x)h(y)is a= Husband Of(y).
proof of A classic example of a bijective proof is Glaisher’seuler’s [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783) “odd equals distinct” partition theorem. Ait as a sum of positive integers, where order does not partition of an integern is a way of writing matter. For example, 6 has eleven partitions: 6, 51, 42, 411, 33, 321, 3111, 222, 2211, 21111, 111111. (Here3111 is shorthand for the sum 3$+ 1 + 1 + 1$, and so on. Since order does not matter, we count 3111 as the same partition of 6 as 1311, 1131, and 1113.
It is convenient to write the partitions with their numbers in decreasing order, as we have done.) A partition is called odd if all its parts are odd, and it is called Odd(n) and Dis distinct(n) be the sets of odd and distinctif all its parts are distinct. Let partitions of\\{51, 33,3111, n111111, respectively. For example$, Odd\\ \text{and Dis}(6) = \\\\{6,51, 42,(3216) =\\\\}$. Euler proved that|Odd(n)| = |Dis(n)| for all n. His “manipulatorics” proof goes as follows.
Letd(n) be the number of odd and distinct partitionso(n) and offunctions$n$, respectively, and let us define the generating  f (q) =n . nf ty = 0 o(n)qn and g(q) =n . nf ty = 0 d(n)qn. With the help of the “multiplication principle” for weighted counting, Euler showed that  f (q) =i . nf ty = 0 1 - q(12)i+1 and g(q) =i . nf ty = 0(1 + qi). 556 Using the algebraic identity 1$+ y = (1 - y2)/(1 - y)$, we have. nf ty . nf ty -2 i 1 q(1 + qi) =

1- qii = 0 i = 0= . nftyi = 0(1 - q . nftyi=2 0 i)(1 -. nftyi = q0(2 i1)- (q2()i)+1). nfty = 1 - q(12()i)+1.i=0

hence follows by extracting the coefficient of$g(q) = f (q)$, and the identityqo(n)n. = d(n) For a very long time, these kinds of manipulation were considered to belong to the realm ofand in order to justify the manipulations of the infi-analysis, nite series and products, one talked about the “region of convergence,” usually|q| < 1, and every step had to be justified by the appropriate analytical theorem. Only relatively recently did people come to realize that no analysis need be involved:
everything makes sense in the completely elementary and much more rigorous (from the philosophical viewpoint) algebra of formal power series gence, so as to exclude, for example, an infinite product. One still needs to worry about conver like$\infty^{i} = 0(1 + x)$, but the notion of convergence in the ring of formal power series is much more user-friendly than its analytical namesake. Euler’s proof, while purely algebraic and elementary, Even though invoking analysis was a red herring, is nevertheless still manipulatorics.
It would be much nicer to find a direct bijection between the sets Dis(n) and Odd(n). Such a bijection was given by Glaisher. Given a distinct partition, write each of its parts as2 r · s, where s is odd, and replace it by 2^r copies of s.(For example, 123 + 3 + 3 + 3.) The output is obviously a partition of the = 4 · 3, so we would replace 12 by same integer the partition(n10, but now into odd parts. For example,, 5, 4) is transformed to the new par - tition(5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1). To define the inverse transformation, take an odd partit shows up.

In fact, everything is combinatorics.

All we need to do is to take the combinatorics out ofthe closet, and make it explicit. The plus sign turns into (disjoint) union, the multiplication sign becomes Cartesian product, and induction turns into recursion. But what about the combinatorial counterpart of the minus sign? In 1982, Garsia and Steven Milne filled this gap by producing an ingenious “involution principle”that enables one to translate the implication

$a = b and c = d ⇒ a - c = b - d$

into a bijective argument, in the sense that if D ⊂ B, and there are natural bijections f: AC \to ⊂ AB andandg: C \to D establishing that |A| = |B|, and |C| = |D|, then it is possible to construct an explicit bijection between A \C and B \D. Let us define it in terms of people. Suppose that in a certain village all the adults are married, with the result that there is a natural bijection from the set of married men to the set of mar-ried women,$m \to \text{Wife Of}(m)$, with its inverse w \to Husband of extramarital affairs, but only one per person, and all(w).
In addition, some of the people have within the village. There is a natural bijection from theset of cheating men to the set of cheating women, called $m \to \text{Mistress Of}(m)$, with its inverse w \to  Lover Of(w). It follows that there are as many faithful men as there are faithful women. But how do we match them up?(One might imagine, for example, that each faithful man wants a faithful woman to go to church with him.) wife to come with him. If she is faithful, she agrees. Ifshe is not, she has a lover, and that lover has a wife. So Here is how it is done.
A faithful man first asks his she tells her husband: “Sorry, hubby, I am going to thepub with my lover, but my lover’s wife may be free.” If this happens, then the man asks the wife of the lover of his wife to go with him, and if she is faithful, she agrees. If she is not he keeps asking the wife of the lover of the woman who has just rejected his proposal. Since the village is finite, he will eventually get to a faithful woman. The reaction of the combinatorial enumeration community to the involution principle was mixed.
On theone hand it had the universal appeal of a general principle, one that should be useful in many attempts tofind bijective proofs of combinatorial identities. On the other hand, its universality is also a major drawback, since involution-principle proofs usually do not give any insight into theone feels a bit cheated. Such a proof answers the specific structures involved, and letter proof of this kind, one still hopes for aof the question, but it misses its spirit really. Given a natural,

Enumerative and Algebraic Combinatorics “involution-principle-free proof.” This is the case, for instance, with the celebrated Rogers–Ramanujan identity, which states that the number of partitions of an integer into parts that leave remainder 1 or 4 when divided by 5 equals the number of partitions of that integer with the property that the difference between any two parts is at least 2. For example, if dinal it i es of{61,4111, 1111111} and {7,61 n ,=527 the car-} are the same.
Garsia and Milne invented their notorious prin-ciple in order to give a Rogers–Ramanujan bijection, there by winning a 50 prize from George Andrews. However, finding a really nice bijective proof is still an open problem. A quintessential example of a bijective proof is Prüfer’s proof of there are(nn)-2 labeled trees on cayley’s [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) celebrated result thatn vertices (example (v) earlier). Recall that a labeled tree is a labeled connected simple graph with out cycles.
Every tree has at least two vertices with only one neighbor (these are called leaves associates with every labeled tree). A certain mapping called the T a vector of integers Prüfer bijection (ator is called its1,. . . , an-2), with 1 Prüfer code⩽ ai. Since there are⩽ n for each i. This vec-(nn)-2 such vectors, Cayley’s formula follows once we have defined the mapping f: Trees\to  Codes and proved that it is indeed a bijection. This really needs four steps:

We A can construct a new set of labeled objects$C = A \times B$, where the labels are disjoint and distinct, and define the size of a pair to be the sum of the sizes of the components. We have

But if “order does not matter,” then the EGF of objects is$[EGF(A)]^{k}/k$!, since there are exact lyk-sets ofk! ways A- of arranging ak-set into an ordered array (since all labels are distinct, all these objects are different).

This useful theorem was part of the physics folklore for many years, and was also implicit in many older combinatorial proofs. However, it was explicated only 558 in the early 1970 s. It was fully “categorized” by means of Joyal’s theory of species, which grew to be a beautiful theory of enumeration in the hands of the école Québecoise and others).(the Labelle and Bergeron frères, Leroux, the EGF of set partitions. That is, let us try to figure outan expression for Here are some venerable examples. Let us try to find

Let the symmetry group belet the set of labeled objects be A.
Then two objects G, anda andb of A are regarded as equivalent if b = g(a) for some member is some symme tryg of the groupg in the group G. This means that there G that transforms a toand the equivalence classes are the setsb.

families and we want to count the number of families. One way would be to define some “canonical head” of Suppose that there is a picnic consisting of many each family, say “mother,” and count the number of mothers. But some daughters look like mothers, so this is not so easy. On the other hand, you cannot just count everybody, since then you would count each family several times. The problem is that “naive” counting of people (or objects) is giving a credit of 1 to each person, and this is in appropriate if we are trying to count families.
If instead we were to ask each person “How bigis your family?” and add to our count the reciprocal of that number, then the calculation would come out just right, since a family of sizek would get a credit of 1 have been counted exactly once by the end.

As usual, regard the elements of the symmetry group as permu-tat i ons of the set of beads. Sincep is a prime, there a rep one element (the identity permutation) with- 1 elements of Zp with one cycle (of length pp cycles), and(all of length 1). It follows that the number of necklaces is $p1 ((p - 1) · a + 1 · a^{p}) = a + a^{p}p - a$.
In particular, since this number is necessarily an integer, we get as a bonus a combinatorial proof of[III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic): that$a^{p} - \text{a is always afer}-$ mat’s little theorem multiple ofp. Perhaps one day there will be an equally nice combinatorial proof of Fermat’sone has to do is to prove that there is no bijection from last theorem.

If one wants to keep track of how many beads there are of each color, one simply replaces straight countingby weighted counting, andc#cycles(g) is replaced by(x1 + · · · + xc()α)1 · ((x1)2 + · · · + (xc)2()α)2 · · · (assuming that g has α1 1 - cycles, α2 2 - cycles, etc.). The resulting expression is the celebrated polynomial. cycle-index

6.1 The Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion and

Möbius In version

Another pillar of enumeration is the principle of inclusion–exclusion (nicknamed PIE). Suppose that there aren sins, s , . . . , s , that a person may succumb to, and suppose that for each set of sins people who have all the sins in1 n S (and possibly others).S, AS is the set of Then the number of good people (with out sins) is

(-1()|()S){|}|A |.SS

For example, if the setπ of \\{1, . . . , n\\} and the A is the set of all permutations ith sin is having π[i] = i, then$|A | = (n − |S|)$!, and we get that the number of

It is considered by many to be the big bang that started modern algebraic combinatorics. Möbius’s original in version formula is recovered when the partially ordered set is N and the partial order is divisibility. A contemporary account of enumeration from the “algebraic” point of view can be found in a marvelous two-volume set by Stanley (2000), which I strongly recommend.
7 Algebraic Combinatorics So far I have described one of the routes to algebraic combinatorics: abstraction and conceptualizati on of classical enumeration. The other route, “concretization of the abstract,” is almost every where dense in mathematics, and cannot be described in a few pages. Letme quote from the preface of the excellent New Perspectives in Algebraic Combinatorics(1999). by Billera et al.
Algebraic combinatorics involves the use of techniques from algebra, topology, and geometry in the solution of combinatorial problems, or the use of combinato-rial methods to attack problems in these areas. Problems amenable to the methods of algebraic combina-torics arise in these or other areas of mathematics or from diverse parts of applied mathematics. Because ofthis interplay with many fields of mathematics, algebraic combinatorics is an area in which a wide variety of ideas and methods come together.

7.1 Tableaux

An interesting class of objects that initially came upin group representation theory, but that turned out to be useful in many other areas—such as, for exam-ple, the theory of algorithms—are Young tableaux. They were first used by Reverend Alfred Young to construct explicit bases for the irreducible representations [IV.9 §2](/part-04/representation-theory) of thetitionλ = λ · · ·symmetric group. ambda of n, a Young tableau of shape[III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups).
For any par-. ambda is 1$k$561 an array of first row,. ambda ken tries in the second row, and so on, such left-justified rows with$λ^{1} \text{entries in the}$ that every row and every column is increasing, and theset of entries is2$\\{1}$,2, . . . , n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. For example, there are two standard Young tableaux whose shape is 22, 1 2 1 3 , 3 4 2 4 and three of shape 31, 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 4 .4 3 2 Letshapef^λ . ambda be the number of standard Young tableaux of.

mathematics (and science!) and this will guarantee that algebraic combinatorial ists will stay very busy for a long time to come.
