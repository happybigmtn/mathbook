III.6 Calabi–Yau Manifolds

Calabi–Yau manifolds, named after Eugenio Calabi and
Shing-Tung Yau, arise in Riemannian geometry and
algebraic geometry, and play a prominent role in string
theory and mirror symmetry.
   In order to explain what they are, we need first
to recall the notion of orientability on a real mani-
fold [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Such a manifold is orientable if you
can choose coordinate systems at each point in such
a way that any two systems x = (x 1 , . . . , x m ) and
y = (y 1 , . . . , y m ) that are defined on overlapping sets   quarter of the way around the equator, then back to
give rise to a positive Jacobi an: det(∂y i /∂x j ) > 0. The    the North Pole again. When the journey is completed,
notion of a Calabi–Yau manifold is the natural com-
plex analogue of this. Now the manifold is complex,
and for each local coordinate system z = (z1 , . . . , zn )    ciate a matrix operator called the holonomy matrix,
one has a holomorphic function [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) f (z). It is
vital that f should be nonvanishing: that is, it never
takes the value 0. There is also a compatibility condi-
tion: if . ar{z}(z) is another coordinate system, then the cor-     of the vector does not change during the process of
responding function f ̃ is related to f by the equation
f = f ̃ det(∂ z̃a /∂zb ). Note that if we replace all complex   ces all lie in the orthogonal group of length-preserving
terms by real terms in this definition, then we have the
notion of a real orientation. So a Calabi–Yau manifold
can be thought of informally as a complex manifold
with complex orientation.
2    Complex Manifolds and Hermitian Structure
Before we go any further, a few words about complex
and Kähler geometry are in order. A complex manifold
is a structure that looks locally like Cn , in the sense
that one can find complex coordinates z = (z1 , . . . , zn )    complex coordinate directions by i =
near every point. More over, where two coordinate sys-
tems z and z̃ overlap, the coordinates z̃ a are holomor-
phic when they are regarded as functions of the z b .
Thus, the notion of a holomorphic function on a com-
plex manifold makes sense and does not depend on the
coordinates used to express the function. In this way,
the local geometry of a complex manifold does indeed
look like an open set in Cn , and the tangent space at a
point looks like Cn itself.
   On complex vector spaces it is natural to consider
Hermitian inner products [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) represented by her-
mitian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) ga. ar{b} with respect to a basis
ea . On complex manifolds, a Hermitian inner product
on the tangent spaces is called a “Hermitian metric,”

and is represented in a coordinate basis by a Hermitian
matrix ga. ar{b} , which depends on position.1

3    Holonomy, and Calabi–Yau Manifolds
1   Basic Definition
On a riemannian manifold [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) one can move a
vector along a path so as to keep it of constant length
and “always pointing in the same direction.” Curvature
expresses the fact that the vector you wind up with at
the end of the path depends on the path itself. When
your path is a closed loop, the vector at the starting
point comes back to a new vector at the same point.
(A good example to think about is a path on a sphere
that goes from the North Pole to the equator, then a
the “constant” vector that began by pointing south will
have been rotated by 90◦ .) With each loop we asso-
which sends the starting vector to the ending vector;
the group generated by all of these matrices is called
the holonomy group of the manifold. Since the length
keeping it constant along the loop, the holonomy matri-
matrices, O(m). If the manifold is oriented, then the
holonomy group must lie in SO(m), as one can see
by transporting an oriented basis of vectors around
the loop.
Every complex manifold of (complex) dimension n
is also a real manifold of (real) dimension m = 2 n,
which one can think of as coordinatized by the real
and imaginary parts of the complex coordinates zj .
Real manifolds that arise in this way have additional
structure. For example, the fact that we can multiply
√
−1 implies
that there must be an operator on the real tangent
space that squares to −1. This operator has eigenvalues
±i, which can be thought of as “holomorphic” and
“anti-holomorphic” directions. The Hermitian property
states that these directions are orthogonal, and we say
that the manifold is Kähler if they remain so after
transport around loops. This means that the holon-
omy group is a subgroup of U(n) (which itself is a
subgroup of SO(m): complex manifolds always have
real orientations). There is a nice local character ization
of the Kähler property: if ga. ar{b} are the components of

there exists a function φ on that patch such that ga. ar{b} =   tensor, and is therefore of interest in general relativity.

   Given a complex orientation—that is, the nonmetric
definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold given above—a
compatible Kähler structure leads to a holonomy that
lies in SU(n) ⊂ U(n), the natural analogue of the case     nently in the leading theory of quantum gravity, string
of real orientation. This is the metric definition of a     theory [IV.17 §2](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras).

complex dimension n and any complex orientation,
there exists a function u and a new Kähler metric g̃,
