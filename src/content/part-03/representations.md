of all, namely Euclidean.) Let us call an element of A
imaginary if it is orthogonal to the element 1. Then
we can define a conjugation operation on A by tak-
ing 1∗ to be 1 and x ∗ to be −x when x is imaginary,
and extending linearly. This operation can be shown
to have all the properties one would like. In particular,    in representation theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory). See also operator

i2 = −1. Now take the algebra generated by i and the
copy of O that lies in A. With some algebraic manip-
ulation, one can demonstrate that this consists of ele-
ments of the form x + iy, with x and y belonging to O.
More over, the product of x + iy and z + iw turns out
to be xz − wy ∗ + i(x ∗ w + zy), which is exactly what
the Cayley–Dickson construction gives.

III.77     Representations
A linear representation of a finite group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) G is     space, which in this case is three-dimensional Euclid-
a way of associating a linear map Tg , from some vec-
tor space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) V to itself, with each element g of     surfaces in a more abstract intrinsic manner: by con-
G. Of course, this association must reflect the group
structure of G, so Tg Th should equal Tgh , and if e is
the identity of G, then Te should be the identity map
on V .
   One useful aspect of linear representations is that
the dimension of the vector space V may be consider-
ably smaller than the size of G. If this is the case, then   in four-dimensional Euclidean space R4 .) It turns out
the representation packages the information about G
in a particularly efficient way. For example, the alter-
nating group [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) A5 , which has sixty elements, is
isomorphic to the group of rotational symmetries of
an icosahedron, and can therefore be thought of as
a group of transformations of R3 (or, equivalently, of
3 . imes 3 matrices).
   A more fundamental reason for representations be-
ing useful is that every representation can be decom-
posed into building blocks known as irreducible repre-
sentations. It turns out that a great deal of information    nal surface, this atlas is sufficient to describe the sur-
about G can be deduced from a few basic facts about
its irreducible representations.
   These ideas can be generalized to infinite groups
as well, and are particularly important in the case of

lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory). Since Lie groups have a differ-
entiable structure, the representations of interest are
those where the homomorphism g → Tg reflects this
structure (for example, by being differentiable).
Representations are discussed in much greater detail
algebras [IV.15 §2](/part-04/operator-algebras).
Terence Tao
Ricci flow is a technique that allows one to take an arbi-
trary riemannian manifold [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and smooth
out the geometry of that manifold to make it look more
symmetric. It has proven to be a very useful tool in
understanding the topology of such manifolds.
Ricci flow can be defined for Riemannian manifolds
of any dimension, but for the sake of exposition we
restrict ourselves here to two-dimensional manifolds
(i.e., surfaces) as they are easy to visualize. From our
everyday experience with three-dimensional space R3 ,
we are familiar with many surfaces, such as spheres,
cylinders, planes, tori (the shape of the surface of a
doughnut), and so forth. This is an extrinsic way to
think about surfaces: as subsets of a larger ambient
ean space. On the other hand, one can think about
side ring how the points in the surface stand in rela-
tion to each other, but not in relation to any exter-
nal space. (For instance, the Klein bottle makes perfect
sense as a surface from an intrinsic viewpoint, but can-
not be viewed extrinsically in three-dimensional Euclid-
ean space R3 , although it can be viewed extrinsically
that the two viewpoints are mostly equivalent to each
other, but it will be more convenient here to adopt the
intrinsic perspective.
A good example of a surface is the surface of Earth.
Extrinsically, this is a subset of a three-dimensional
space R3 . But we can also view this surface two dimen-
sion ally by using an atlas: a collection of maps or charts
that describe various regions of this surface by identi-
fying them with a subset of a two-dimensional plane.
As long as we have enough charts to cover the origi-
face. This way of thinking of a surface is not completely
intrinsic, because there is more than one atlas that one
could associate with this surface, and they may differ in
various minor ways. For instance, in one atlas the city
