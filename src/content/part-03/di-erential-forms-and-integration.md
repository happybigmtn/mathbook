It goes without saying that integration is one of the fundamental concepts of single-variable calculus. How-ever, there are in fact three concepts of integration that appear in the subject: theknown as the antiderivative indefinite integral), the unsigned definite inte-f (also gral[a, b] f (x) dx(which one would use to find the area under a curve, or the mass of a one-dimensional object of varying density), and the signed definite integral compute the work required to move a particle fromab f (x) dx (which one would use, for instance, toa tob functions). For simplicity we shall restrict our attention here tof: R\to  R that are continuous on the entire real line (and similarly, when we come to differential forms, we shall discuss only forms that are continuous on the entire domain). \text{We shall also informally use terminology such as} “infinitesimal” \text{in order to avoid having to discuss the} (routine) “epsilon–delta” \text{analytical issues that one must resolve in order to make these integration concepts fully rigorous}. \text{closely related to each other in single}-\text{variable calcu} - lus; indeed, \text{These three concepts of integration are of coursethe fundamental theorem of calculus} [I.3 §5.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) \text{relates the signed definite integralto any one of the indefinite integrals} F = \text{a bff} (x)\text{by thedx} formula$bf (x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$, (1)

Again, we do not require(xi)+1 to be to the right of xi; it is quite possible for the path to “backtrack” repeat-edly: for instance, one might have$x < x^{+} > x^{+} for$ some backtracking eventually cancels itself out; regard less$i$. However, it turns out that the effect of such$(i^{i}()^{1}()^{i})^{2}$ of what path we choose, the expression (3) above con-verges as the maximum step size tends to zero, and the

For example, ifk-dimensional manifold S, over which the inte-n = 3 and k = 2, then one is integrating over a surface that lives in R3. Let us begin with the case n ⩾ 1 and k = 1.

(These points path is open or closed.) From a physical point of view, we are still computing the work required to move froma to b, but now we are moving in several dimensions plicity, although the true power of the integration-of-forms concept ismuch more apparent when we integrate on more general spaces, such1. We will start with integration on Euclidean spaces Rn for sim- as abstractn-dimensional manifolds.

In the one-dimensional case, we did notneed to specify exactly which path we used to get from a However, in higher dimensions, the exact choice of theto b, because all backtracking canceled itself out. pathγ becomes important. parametrizedγ Formally, a path fromfrom the unit interval) as a continuously differentiable function[a0,1 to] bto can be described (or Rn such that γ(0) =a and γ(1) = b. For instance, the line segment froma to b can be parametrized as γ(t) = (1 - t)a + tb. This segment also has many other par a me tr iz at i ons, such as  ̃γ(t) = (1 - t2)a + t2 b; however, as in the one dimensional case, the exact choice of parametrization does not ultimately influence the integral. On the other hand, the reverse line segment$(-γ)(t) = ta + (1 - t)b$ fromalongb-γtowill turn out to be the negative of the integralais a genuinely different path; the integral alongγ. approximate the continuous path As in the one-dimensional case, we will need to$γ \text{by a discrete pathx}^{0} = γ(t^{0})$, x1 = γ(t1)$, x2 = γ(t2)$, $. . . , xn = γ(tn)$, whereγ(t0) = a and γ(tn) = b. Again, we allow some backtracking: displacementtΔi +x1 is not necessarily larger than= x - x \in  Rn from x to xti. Theis now aon the generalization to manifolds, one should think vector rather than a scalar. (Indeed, with an eye$(i^{i}()^{+1}()^{i}()^{i}()^{i})^{+1}$ ofΔxas an infinitesimal tangent vector to the ambii ent space Rn at the point x .) In the one-dimensional i

case, we converted the scalar displacementΔx intoi

a new number$f (x^{i})\Delta x^{i}$, which was linearly related to the original displacement by a proportionality con-stantf (x ) that depended on the position x . In higher dimensions, we again have a linear dependence, but$i^{i}$ this time, since the displacement is a vector, we must replace the simple constant of proportionality by a linear transformation represents the infinitesimal “work” required to move$ω^{x}^{i} from R^{n} to R$.

In particular, one can remove the requirement thatγ2 \text{begins where} γ1 leaves off by generalizing the notion of an integral to cover not just integration on paths, but also integration on formal sums or differences of paths. This makes the duality between curves and forms more symmetric.

Adding a pair It turns out that one can generalize all three of of forms is easy: if[0,1]k \to Rnis a continuously differentiable function,ω and η are two k-forms and φ: thenφ(ω + η)is defined to beφ ω +φ η.

To see what this might mean, and in particular to seewhy dω is a (k + 1)-form, let us think how we might answer a question of the following kind. We are givena spherical surface in R3 and a flow, and we would like to know the net flux out of the surface: that is, the dif-ference between the amount of flux coming out and the amount going in. One way to do this would be to approximate the surface of the sphere by a union of tiny parallelograms, to measure the flux through each one, and to take the sum of all these fluxes. another would be to approximate the solid sphere by a union of tiny parallelepipeds, to measure the net flux out of each of these, and to add up the results. If a parallelepiped issmall enough, then we can closely approximate the net flux out of it by looking at the difference, for each pair of opposite faces, between the amount coming out ofthe parallelepiped through one and the amount going into it through the other, and this will depend on the rate of change of the 2-form. parallelepipeds is more rigorously described as inte-The process of summing up the net fluxes out of the grating a 3-form over the solid sphere. In this way, onecan see that it is natural to expect that information about how a 2-form varies should be encapsulated in a 3-form. a little bit of algebra and is omitted here. However, The exact construction of these operations requires we remark that they obey similar laws to their scalar counterparts, except that there are some sign changes that are ultimately due to the antisymmetry (9). \text{For instance}, \text{if commutative law for} \text{multiplication} becomesω \text{is a} k-\text{form and} η \text{is an} l - form, theω ∧ η = (-1)klη ∧ ω, 179 \text{basically because dimensions with}\text{lkl dimensions}; \text{and the derivation ruleswaps are needed to interchange} k for differentiation becomes d$(ω ∧ η) = (dω) ∧ η + (-1)^{k}ω ∧ (dη)$. Another rule is that the differentiation operator d isnilpotent: d(dω) = 0. (11) This may seem rather unintuitive, but it is fundamen-tally important. To see why it might be expected, let us think about differentiating a 1-form twice. The orig-inal 1-form associates a scalar with each small line segment. Its derivative is a 2-form that associates a scalar with each small parallelogram. This scalar essentially measures the sum of the scalars given by the 1-formas you go around the four edges of the parallelogram, though to get a sensible answer when you pass to the limit you have to divide by the area of the parallelo-gram. If we now repeat the process, we are looking at a sum of the six scalars associated with the six facesof a parallelepiped. But each of these scalars in turn comes from a sum of the scalars associated with thefour directed edges around the corresponding face, and each edge is therefore counted twice (as it belongs totwo faces), once in each direction. Therefore, the contributions from each edge cancel and the sum of all contributions is zero. tween integrating a 2-form over the surface of a sphere The description given earlier of the relationship beand integrating its derivative over the solid sphere canbe thought of as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, and can itself be generalized considerably: Stokes’s theorem is the assertion that for any oriented manifold oriented boundary of SSd(which we will not define here).ωS=\text{and form}\partial S ω ω, where \partial S is the(12) Indeed one can view this theorem as a definition of the derivative operationω \to dω; thus, differentiation is the identity (11) is dual to the geometric observation that adjoint of the boundary operation.

This observation lets one extend the notions of closed and exact forms to general differential forms, which (together with (11)) allows one to fully set up We have already seen that 0-forms can be identified de Rham cohomology. with scalar functions. Also, in Euclidean spaces one can
