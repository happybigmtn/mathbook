$t^{1}/^{2}$ is just a formal square root of t. The Alexander polynomial is obtained by the substitution $v = 1$ , $z = t - 1/2 - t^{1}/^{2}$ . This latter polynomial is well understood in terms of topology, by way of the fundamental group, covering spaces, and homology theory, and can be calculated by various methods involving determinants. It was J. H. Conway who, in discussing in 1969 his normalized version of the Alexander polynomial (the polynomial in one variable z obtained by substituting $v = 1$ into the HOMFLY polynomial), first developed the theory of skein relations. There is one more polynomial (due to L. H. Kauffman) based on a linear skein relation. The relation involves four links with unoriented diagrams differing as follows: . There are examples of pairs of knots that the Kauffman polynomial but not the HOMFLY polynomial can distinguish and vice versa; some pairs are not distinguished by any of these polynomials.

Application to Alternating Knots

For the Jones polynomial there is a particularly simple formulation, by means of “Kauffman’s bracket polynomial,” that leads to an easy proof that the Jones (but not the HOMFLY) polynomial is coherently defined. This approach has been used to give the first rigorous confirmation of P. G. Tait’s ( 1898 ) highly believable proposal that a reduced alternating diagram of a knot has the minimal number of crossings for any diagram of that knot. Here “alternating” means that in going along the knot the crossings go: ... over, under, over, under, over, ... . Not every knot has such a diagram. “Reduced” means that there are, adjacent to each crossing, four distinct regions of the diagram’s planar complement. Thus, for example, any nontrivial reduced alternating diagram is not a diagram of the unknot. Also, the figure eight knot certainly has no diagram with only three crossings.

Physics

Unlike that of Alexander, the HOMFLY polynomial has no known interpretation in terms of classical algebraic topology. It can, however, be reformulated as a collection of state sums, summing over certain labelings of a knot diagram. This recalls ideas from statistical mechanics; an elementary account is given in Kauffman

227 ( 1991). An amplification of the whole HOMFLY polynomial theory leads into a version of conformal field theory called topological quantum field theory.

III . $45$ K-Theory K-theory concerns one of the most important invariants of a topological space [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) X, a pair of groups called the K-groups of X. To form the group $K^{0}$ (X) one takes all (equivalence classes of) vector bundles on X, and uses the direct sum as the group operation. This leads not to a group but to a semigroup. However, from the semigroup one can easily construct a group in the same way that one constructs Z out of N : by taking equivalence classes of expressions of the form a  -  b. If i is a positive integer, then there is a natural way of defining a group K  -  i (X) : it is closely related to the group $K^{0}$ (S i $\times$ X). The very important Bott periodicity theorem says that K i (X) depends only on the parity of i, so there are in fact just two distinct K-groups, $K^{0}$ (X) and $K^{1}(X)$ . See algebraic topology [IV.6](/part-04/algebraic-topology) for more details. If X is a topological space such as a compact manifold, then one can associate with it the C ∗ - algebra C (X) of all continuous functions from X to C . It turns out to be possible to define the K-groups in terms of this algebra in such a way that it applies to algebras that are not of the form C (X) . In particular, it applies to algebras where multiplication is not commutative. For instance, K-theory provides important invariants of C ∗ - algebras .
