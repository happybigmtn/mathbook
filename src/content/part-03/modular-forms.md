that n ≡ r mod m. This number r is often called the least residue or simply the residue of n to the modulus m. Now let us consider the third question posed at the beginning of this article, namely the matter of when $n^{2} - 5$ is $a$ power of two. When $n = 3$ , $3^{2} - 5 = 4$ is a power of two, but a little experimentation does not reveal any further examples. What aspect of the problem changes as n becomes larger than $3$ ? The key observation is that $n^{2} - 5$ is now greater than $4$ , and so if it were a power of $2$ , then it would have to be divisible by $8$ .
That would mean that $n^{2}$ ≡ $5$ mod $8$ , but this is never the case. Indeed, the residues of the first eight squares are $1$ , $4$ , $1$ , $0$ , $1$ , $4$ , $1$ , $0$ , and we know that the sequence will repeat with period $8$ (actually , it repeats with period 4). Thus, it never contains $a5$ . Modular arithmetic should be used with care. Although the rules for addition and subtraction are simple, division is some what more subtle. For example, if we are given that ac ≡ bc mod m, it is not, in general, permissible to divide by c and conclude that a ≡ b mod m:
consider, for instance, the case a $= 2$ , $b = 4$ , $c = 3$ , $m = 6$ . Let us examine what has just gone wrong. To say that ac ≡ bc mod m means that m divides ac  -  bc  =  (a  -  b) $\times$ c . But this clearly does not mean that m divides a  -  b, since m could divide c (or at least have a common factor with it). However, if m has no factor in common with c, then it must divide a  -  b, so in this case we do indeed have a ≡ b mod m. In particular, for any prime number p we have the very useful cancelation law: if ac ≡ bc mod $p$ and $c$  ≡ $0$ mod p, then a ≡ b mod p.
The examples so far may have suggested that the principal uses of modular arithmetic are to do with specific moduli such as $10$ and $8$ . However, this is far from true, and the subject really comes into its own when one looks at more general m. For example, one of the basic results in number theory is Fermat’s little theorem, which states that if p is a prime and a  ≡ $0$ mod p, then $a^{p} - {}^{1}$ ≡ $1$ mod  p. Let us quickly prove this. Consider the numbers $a,2a$ , $3a$ , . . . , $(p - 1)a$ mod  p.
If r a ≡ sa mod p, then from the cancelation law we can deduce that r ≡ s mod p, from which it follows that $a,2a$ , . . . , $(p - 1)a$ are all different modulo p. Further more, none of these numbers is $0$ mod p. We are thus forced to conclude that the numbers $a,2a$ , $3a$ , . . . , $(p - 1$ ) a mod p are simply a rearrangement of the numbers $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , . . . , $p - 1$ mod  p. In particular, the products

of the numbers in these two sets are the same, which implies that $a^{p} - {}^{1}(p - 1)$ ! ≡ $(p - 1)$ ! mod p. Since (p $- 1$ ) ! is not a multiple of p, we can apply the cancelation law again and divide both sides by (p $- 1$ ) ! . This implies the result. Euler’s theorem is a generalization of Fermat’s little theorem to composite moduli. It states that if m is a positive integer and a is another positive integer that is coprime to m (this means that $a$ and $m$ have no common factor), then a φ (m) ≡ $1$ mod m. Here φ is Euler’s totient function:
φ (m) is the number of integers less than m that are coprime to m. For instance, if m $= 9$ , then the integers less than m and coprime to m are $1$ , $2$ , $4$ , $5$ , $7$ , and $8$ , so $φ(9) = 6$ and we can deduce from Euler’s theorem that $5^{6}$ ≡ $1$ mod $9$ . Let us check this directly: $5^{6} = 15625$ , so the sum of its digits is $19$ , which is indeed congruent to $1$ mod $9$ .
For further discussion of the Fermat-Euler theorem, see mathematics and cryptography [VII.7](/part-07/mathematics-and-cryptography), computational number theory [IV.3](/part-04/computational-number-theory), and the weil conjectures [V.35](/part-05/the-weil-conjectures). The final question from above--whether $n^{7} - 77$ is ever a Fibonacci number--is left as an exercise to the reader. III . $59$ Modular Forms

A Lattice in the Complex Numbers

When one first learns about the complex numbers, one is taught to think of them as a two-dimensional space, with one real and one imaginary dimension: a complex number $z = x + iy$ has real part x and imaginary part  y, where $i$ is a square root of $- 1$ . Now let us consider what the complex numbers that have integers for their real and imaginary parts look like. These complex numbers, such as $3 + 4i$ or $- 23i$ , form a “lattice” in the complex plane (see figure $1$ ). By definition, every element of this lattice is of the form m  +  ni for some pair of integers $m$ and $n$.
We say that the lattice is generated by $1$ and i, and use the notation Z  +  Z i for it. Note that this lattice can be generated in plenty of other ways. For example, it is also generated by the pair (1 , $- i)$ , the pair (1 , $100 + i)$ or even the pair $(101 + i,100 + i)$ . In fact, one can easily check that this lattice is generated by the pair (a  +  bi, c  +  di) (meaning that every element of the lattice is an integer combination of a  +  bi and c  +  di) if and only if a, b, c, and d are integers and $ad - bc =$ ± $1$ .

III.59.   Modular Forms

Now let v and w be any two complex numbers and
consider the set of complex numbers of the form av +
bw, again with a and b integers (see figure 2).
  A lattice is exactly such a thing: a grid Zv + Zw in the
complex plane generated by two complex numbers v
and w, with the provisos that neither v nor w is zero
and that v/w is not real (this is just to ensure that v
and w do not both lie on one line).
  If τ = x + iy is a complex number with y ≠ 0, then
there is a standard lattice associated with τ, namely
Zτ +Z. We call this lattice Λτ and note that Λτ = Λ−τ . In
general, however, distinct complex numbers τ give rise
to distinct lattices—and further more there are plenty
of lattices that are not equal to Λτ for any τ, for the
simple reason that 1 belongs to Λτ for every τ.

If Λ is a lattice generated by v and w, and α is a nonzero
complex number, then one can multiply the entire situ-

ation by α and deduce that αΛ is the lattice generated
by αv and αw. Geometrically, this says that one can
rotate and rescale lattices.
   If Λ is a lattice generated by v and w, and we scale
it by dividing everything by w, then we get a new lat-
tice (1/w)Λ, which is generated by v/w and w/w = 1.
In particular, this new lattice is equal to Λτ for the
complex number τ = v/w.
   It may seem like an odd thing to do, but one can apply
this scaling trick to Λτ itself. The lattice Λτ is generated    τ ∈ H.
by (τ, 1) but also by any pair (v, w) = (aτ + b, cτ + d),
if a, b, c, and d are integers such that ad − bc = ±1.
If we divide by cτ + d and set σ = (aτ + b)/(cτ + d),
then we see that

4   Modular Forms as Functions on Lattices
The formal definition of a modular form is rather unen-
lightening: it is a function that obeys certain bound-
edness conditions and transformation properties. One
way of seeing where the transformation properties
come from is to think about lattices. If k is an integer,
then a modular form of weight k is a function f that
associates a complex number f (Λ) with any lattice Λ,
and has the property that
f (αΛ) = α−k f (Λ).
The function also has to satisfy some other properties
(a different i ability condition and a boundedness condi-
tion), but the crucial property is the one above. If k is
even and at least 4, then an example of a modular form
of weight k is the Eisenstein series Gk defined by the

formula                       
Gk (Λ) =
0≠λ∈Λ
The assumption that k is at least 4 guarantees that the
sum converges, and the evenness of k ensures that the
function is nonzero.
We have seen that any lattice can be scaled so that
it takes the form Λτ for some τ, so (2) implies that a
modular form will be determined by its values on such
lattices. If H denotes the complex numbers with pos-
itive imaginary part, then, because Λτ = Λ−τ , a modu-
lar form is in fact determined by its values on Λτ for
However, an arbitrary function on H does not give
us a modular form: equation (1) tells us that if f is a
modular form and F is the function on H defined by
F (τ) = f (Λτ ), then F must satisfy the equation
