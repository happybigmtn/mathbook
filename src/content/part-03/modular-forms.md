that n ≡ r mod m. This number r is often called the least residue or simply the residue of n to the modulus m. Now let us consider the third question posed at the beginning of this article, namely the matter of when $n^{2} - 5$ is $a$ power of two. When $n = 3$ , $3^{2} - 5 = 4$ is a power of two, but a little experimentation does not reveal any further examples. What aspect of the problem changes as n becomes larger than $3$ ? The key observation is that $n^{2} - 5$ is now greater than $4$ , and so if it were a power of $2$ , then it would have to be divisible by $8$ . That would mean that $n^{2}$ ≡ $5$ mod $8$ , but this is never the case. Indeed, the residues of the first eight squares are $1$ , $4$ , $1$ , $0$ , $1$ , $4$ , $1$ , $0$ , and we know that the sequence will repeat with period $8$ (actually , it repeats with period 4). Thus, it never contains $a5$ . Modular arithmetic should be used with care. Although the rules for addition and subtraction are simple, division is somewhat more subtle. For example, if we are given that ac ≡ bc mod m, it is not, in general, permissible to divide by c and conclude that a ≡ b mod m: consider, for instance, the case a $= 2$ , $b = 4$ , $c = 3$ , $m = 6$ . Let us examine what has just gone wrong. To say that ac ≡ bc mod m means that m divides ac  -  bc  =  (a  -  b) $\times$ c . But this clearly does not mean that m divides a  -  b, since m could divide c (or at least have a common factor with it). However, if m has no factor in common with c, then it must divide a  -  b, so in this case we do indeed have a ≡ b mod m. In particular, for any prime number p we have the very useful cancelation law: if ac ≡ bc mod $p$ and $c$  ≡ $0$ mod p, then a ≡ b mod p. The examples so far may have suggested that the principal uses of modular arithmetic are to do with specific moduli such as $10$ and $8$ . However, this is far from true, and the subject really comes into its own when one looks at more general m. For example, one of the basic results in number theory is Fermat’s little theorem, which states that if p is a prime and a  ≡ $0$ mod p, then $a^{p} - {}^{1}$ ≡ $1$ mod  p. Let us quickly prove this. Consider the numbers $a,2a$ , $3a$ , . . . , $(p - 1)a$ mod  p. If r a ≡ sa mod p, then from the cancelation law we can deduce that r ≡ s mod p, from which it follows that $a,2a$ , . . . , $(p - 1)a$ are all different modulo p. Further more, none of these numbers is $0$ mod p. We are thus forced to conclude that the numbers $a,2a$ , $3a$ , . . . , $(p - 1$ ) a mod p are simply a rearrangement of the numbers $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , . . . , $p - 1$ mod  p. In particular, the products

of the numbers in these two sets are the same, which implies that $a^{p} - {}^{1}(p - 1)$ ! ≡ $(p - 1)$ ! mod p. Since (p $- 1$ ) ! is not a multiple of p, we can apply the cancelation law again and divide both sides by (p $- 1$ ) ! . This implies the result. Euler’s theorem is a generalization of Fermat’s little theorem to composite moduli. It states that if m is a positive integer and a is another positive integer that is coprime to m (this means that $a$ and $m$ have no common factor), then a φ (m) ≡ $1$ mod m. Here φ is Euler’s totient function: φ (m) is the number of integers less than m that are coprime to m. For instance, if m $= 9$ , then the integers less than m and coprime to m are $1$ , $2$ , $4$ , $5$ , $7$ , and $8$ , so $φ(9) = 6$ and we can deduce from Euler’s theorem that $5^{6}$ ≡ $1$ mod $9$ . Let us check this directly: $5^{6} = 15625$ , so the sum of its digits is $19$ , which is indeed congruent to $1$ mod $9$ . For further discussion of the Fermat-Euler theorem, see mathematics and cryptography [VII.7](/part-07/mathematics-and-cryptography), computational number theory [IV.3](/part-04/computational-number-theory), and the weil conjectures [V.35](/part-05/the-weil-conjectures). The final question from above--whether $n^{7} - 77$ is ever a Fibonacci number--is left as an exercise to the reader. III . $59$ Modular Forms

A Lattice in the Complex Numbers

When one first learns about the complex numbers, one is taught to think of them as a two-dimensional space, with one real and one imaginary dimension: a complex number $z = x + iy$ has real part x and imaginary part  y, where $i$ is a square root of $- 1$ . Now let us consider what the complex numbers that have integers for their real and imaginary parts look like. These complex numbers, such as $3 + 4i$ or $- 23i$ , form a “lattice” in the complex plane (see figure $1$ ). By definition, every element of this lattice is of the form m  +  ni for some pair of integers $m$ and $n$. We say that the lattice is generated by $1$ and i, and use the notation Z  +  Z i for it. Note that this lattice can be generated in plenty of other ways. For example, it is also generated by the pair (1 , $- i)$ , the pair (1 , $100 + i)$ or even the pair $(101 + i,100 + i)$ . In fact, one can easily check that this lattice is generated by the pair (a  +  bi, c  +  di) (meaning that every element of the lattice is an integer combination of a  +  bi and c  +  di) if and only if a, b, c, and d are integers and $ad - bc =$ ± $1$ .
