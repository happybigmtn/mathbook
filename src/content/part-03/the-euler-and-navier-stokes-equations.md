This error estimate shows just how special the contin-ued-fraction approximations are: if you pick a denom in at orq without thinking, and then select the numera- torcan guarantee is thatp that makes p/q xclosest tolies betweenx, the only thing you(p - 1/2)/q and(pwhich is much bigger than 1+ 1/2)/q. So the error could be as large as 1/(q2) if q is a large integer./(2 q), can have even smaller error than is guaranteed by (8).For example, the approximation Sometimes a continued-fraction approximation to$π \approx 355/113 \text{that wex}$ get by truncating (7) at the third level is exceptionally accurate, the reason being that the next partial quotient, 292, is rather large. So we are not changing the fraction much by ignoring the tail 1$/(292 + 1/(1 +$. ..)). In this sense, the most difficult number to approximate by fractions is the one with the smallest possible partial quotients, i.e., the one with all its partial quotients equal to 1. This number, 1+ 1 + (11)+1. . , (9). can be easily calculated because the sequence of par-tial quotients is periodic: it repeats itself. If we call the numberrocal of this number is exactly the continued fractionφ$, then φ - 1 is 1/(1 + 1/(1 + . ..))$. The recip-$(9) for$φ. Hence= φ,φ - 1

Since the number we are try- ing to find is positive, it is the first of these roots: theso-called golden ratio. the positive solution of the equation any other periodic continued fraction represents a root It is quite easy to show that, just as (9) represents$x^{2} - x - 1 = 0$, of a quadratic equation. This fact seems to have been understood already in the sixteenth century. It is quitea lot trickier to prove the converse: that the continued fraction of any quadratic surd is periodic. This was

For instance, if we truncate rational functions: functions that the fraction for the tangent after one level, then we getthe approximation \tan x \approx 1 - xx2/3 = 3 - 3 xx2. This continued fraction, and the rapidity with which its truncations approach tanx, played the central role in the proof thattwo whole numbers. The proof was found by Johannπis irrational: thatπ is not the ratio of Lambert in the 1760 s. He used the continued fractionto show that ifx is a rational number (other than 0), \text{then tanx is not}. \text{But tan}π/4 = 1 (\text{which certainly is rational})$, soπ/4 \text{cannot be}$.

The Euler and Navier–Stokes equations describe themotion of an idealized fluid. They are important in science and engineering, yet they are very poorly under-stood. They present a major challenge to mathematics.
