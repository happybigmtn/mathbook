From the definition of topological spaces to the fun-da mental group and a little beyond, I like M. A. Armstrong’s The current standard graduate textbook is A. Hatcher’s Basic Topology (Springer, New York, 1983). Algebraic Topology (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002). Two of the great topologists, Bott and Milnor, are also brilliant writers. Every young topologist should read R. Bott and L. Tu’sin Algebraic Topology (Springer, New York, 1982), J. Mil-Differential Forms nor’ston, NJ, 1963), and J. Milnor and J.

Taubes 1 Smooth Manifolds This article is about classifying certain objects called smooth manifolds, so I need to start by telling you what they are. A good example to keep in mind is the surface of a smooth ball. If you look at a small portion ofit from very close up, then it looks like a portion of a flat plane, but of course it differs in a radical way froma flat plane on larger distance scales. This is a general phenomenon:
a smooth manifold can be very convoluted, but must be quite regular in close-up. This “local regularity” is the condition that each point in a manifold belongs to a neighborhood that looks like a portion of standard Euclidean space in some dimension. If the dimension in question isfold, then the manifold itself is said to have dimensiond for every point of the mani-d. A schematic of this is shown in figure 1.What does it mean to say that a neighborhood “looks like a portion of standard Euclidean space”?
It means that there is a “nice” one-to-one mapφ from the neigh- borhood into Rd (with its usual notion of distance). One can think ofborhood with points inφas “identifying” points in the neigh-R$d$: that is, xis identified with coordinate chartφ(x). If we do this, then the functionof the neighborhood, and any chosenφ is called a basis for the linear functions on the Euclidean space is called a coordinate system. The reason for this is that φ allows us to use the coordinates in Rd to label points in the neighborhood: ifx belongs to the neighborhood,

IV. Branches of Mathematics

Figure 1 resemble regions in a Euclidean space. Small portions of a manifold Figure 2 grid to a distorted rectangular grid. A transition function from a rectangular then one can label it with the coordinates ofφ(x). For example, Europe is part of the surface of a sphere. Atypical map of Europe identifies each point in Europe with a point in flat, two-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, a square grid labeled with latitude and longitude. These two numbers give us a coordinate sys-tem for the map, which can also be transferred to a coordinate system for Europe itself.
Now, here is a straightforward but central observation. Suppose that intersect, and suppose that functions M and N are two neighborhoods thatφ:$M \to R^{d} andψ$: N \to  Rd are used to give them each a coordinate chart. Then the intersection M ∩N is given two coordi- nate charts, and this gives us an identification between the open regions$φ(M ∩ N) and ψ(M ∩ N) of R^{d}$: given a point in the second isxin the first region, the corresponding point$ψ(φ^{-1}(x))$.
This composition of maps is called a coordinates from one of the charts on the intersecting transition function, and it tells you how the region relate to those of the other. The transition func-tion is a homeomorphism [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) between the regions

φ(M ∩ N) and ψ(M ∩ N).
