1 Introduction

Succinctly put, algebraic geometry is the study of geom-etry using polynomials and the investigation of polynomials using geometry.Many of us were taught the beginnings of algebraic geometry in high school, under the name “analytic geometry.” When we say thaty = mx + b \text{is the equa}- tion of a line L, \text{or that} x2 + y2 = r2 \text{describes a circle} C of radiusr , we establish a basic connection between geometry and algebra.If we want to find the points where the line L and the circley in the circle equation to get C intersect, we just substitutex2 + (mxmx+ b)+2 b= forr2 and solve the resulting quadratic equation to obtain the x This simple example encapsulates the method of coordinates of the two intersection points. algebraic geometry: a geometric problem is translated into algebra, where it is readily solvable; conversely, we get insight into algebra problems by using geometry.It is hard to guess the solutions of systems of polynomial equations, but once a corresponding geometric picture is drawn, we start to have a qualitative understanding of them. The precise quantitative answer is then provided by algebra. 2 Polynomials and Their Geometry Polynomials are the expressions one can put together from variables and numbers by addition and multiplication. The most familiar are one-variable polynomials such asx3 - x + 4, but we can use two or three vari- ables to get, for instance, 2$x5 - 3xy2 + y3 (\text{which has}$ degree 5 in two variables) or$x5 - y7 + x2z8 - xyz + 1$ (which has degree 10 in three variables). In general, onecan usen variables, in which case they are frequently denoted by$x^{1}$, x2, . . . , xn$, \text{and we write} f (x1$, . . . , xn), f (\text{Polynomials are the only functions that computersx}) \text{or simply fto denote an unspecified polynomial}. \text{can work with}. (\text{Although your pocket calculator islikely to have a button for logarithms}, \text{it is secretly computing a polynomial whose value at a number with logb up to many decimal places}.) b \text{agrees for the linex}2 \text{We can slightly rewrite the equations we gave earlier} + y2 - r2 L=\text{and the circle}0. \text{We can then describe} C: as$y - mx L and - b C = as0 andzero$363 Figure 1 A \text{hyperboloid intersecting a plane}. \text{setsall points}: L \text{is the zero set of}(x, y) \text{such thaty} y--mxmx--bb(\text{that is}, \text{the set of} = 0) and C \text{is the zero set ofx}2 + y2 - r2. Similarly, \text{the zero set of} 2 x2 + 3 y2 - z2 - 7 in 3 - space is a hyperboloid, the zero set of$z - x - y in 3 - \text{space is a}$ plane, and the common zero set of these two equationsin 3-space is the intersection of the hyperboloid and the plane, which is an ellipse (see figure 1). The set of common zeros of a system of polynomial equations in any number of variables is called analgebraic set. These are the basic objects of algebraic geometry. few have a feeling for 4-space, also calledand 5-space is by and large inconceivable to almost Most people feel that geometry ends in 3-space. Veryspace-time, everyone. So what is the meaning of geometry in many variables? Algebra comes to our rescue here. While I have great difficulty visualizing what a four-dimensional sphere ofradiusr in 5-space should be, I can easily write down its equation,(x2)1 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 + (x2)4 + (x5)2 - r2 = 0, \text{and work with it}. \text{This equation is also something acomputer can handle}, \text{which is immensely useful in applications}. \text{for the rest of this article}. \text{This is where all geometry} I will, nonetheless, \text{stick to two or three variables starts and there are plenty of interesting questions and results}. \text{The importance of algebraic geometry derives from the fact that significant interactions between algebra} 364 \text{and geometry happen very frequently}. \text{Let us look attwo examples}, \text{just for illustration}. 3 \text{Most Shapes Are Algebraic Shapes that occur frequently enough to have their ownname}, \text{for instance}, lines, planes, circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, hyperboloids, paraboloids, ellipsoids, \text{are almost all algebraic}. \text{Even the more esoteric conchoid} (\text{or shell curve}) of Dürer, \text{the trident of}[VI.14](/part - 06/isaac - newton - 16421727), and the folium of Kepler are algebraic.newton Some shapes cannot be described by polynomial equations, but they can be described by polynomial inequalities.

Let us think for a moment about what 3-spaceis for us.

Let us make a jump here, and declare that “3-space modulo 2”is the collection of all “points” given by three coordinates modulo 2. Four of these are listed above, and thereare four more. The beauty of algebra is that suddenly we can talk about lines, planes, spheres, cones in this“3-space having only eight points.” ulo any integer. For example, working modulo 7, wehave 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as possible coordinates, and so We do not need to stop here, and one can work mod“3-space modulo 7” has 73$= 343 points$. intriguing, but also technically difficult.

(For instance, the intersection points with the$x - \text{axis are} (±\sqrt{R}$, 0).) solutions ofcan also look for solutions in the “plane modulo If R is a rational number, we can ask about rationalx2 + y2 = R, and if R is an integer, wem” for any One can even look for solutions where m. x = x(t), y = y(t) are themselves polynomials in a variable t.

Can we determine a$R < 0)$. polynomial from its snapshots? bola, but “an” equation would be more correct. Indeed, the hyperbola One frequently talks about “the” equation of a hyper-x2 - y2 - R = 0 can also be given by an equationcx2 - cy2 - c R = 0, for any c ≠ 0. We can also use the equation$(x^{2} - y^{2} - R)^{2} = 0$, \text{which we may} well not recognize in its expanded form. Higher powerscan also be used. What about the equation$f$ (x$, y) =(x^{2} - y^{2} - R)(x^{2} + y^{2} + R^{2}) =$0? If we look only at real solutions, this is still just the hyperbola sincex2 + y2 + R2 is always positive for x, y real. However, as with one-variable polynomials, one should look at all complex roots to understand everything. Then we see thatis not on the hyperbola$f (\sqrt{-1R}$, 0) = 0, but the complex pointx2 - y2 - R = 0.

What happens with a systemg(x$, y) =$0? Geometrically we see two curves in the$f$ (x$, y) =$ plane, so we expect that there will typically be finitely many intersection points. These usually intersect in a single point, but they canbe parallel and they can coincide. The first case leads Iff , g are both linear, we have two lines in the plane. to the classical declaration that “parallel lines meet atinfinity” and the definition of projective planes and projective spaces tive spaces and the corresponding projective varieties[III.72](/part-03/projective-space). (The introduction of projecis a key step in algebraic geometry. It is somewhat tech-nical so we shall skip it here, but it is indispensable even at the most basic level.)Next, consider two polynomials of degree 2, that is, two plane conics. Two smooth conics usually intersectin at most four points (just try this by drawing two ellipses). There are also some rather degenerate cases.Two conics may coincide, or, if they are both reducible, they can have a common line.

Evenin very degenerate situations it is possible to define and count the multiplicities easily. This is frequently of great help since the typical (or “generic”) cases are usually very hard to compute. To get around this problem, we can sometimes find a special, degenerate case where we know that the answer will be the same, butthe computations are much easier. algebraic and one geometric. The algebraic definition is computationally very efficient, but somewhat techni-There are two ways to think about multiplicity: one cal.

Also, even when the second alternative holds, we may want to count the number of isolated intersection points; this can be very tricky but also very useful. 7 Varieties, Schemes, Orbifolds, and Stacks Consider the systemof two pieces, thezxz==0 plane and theyz = 0 in 3-space. It consistsx = y = 0 line. It is easy to see that neither the plane nor the linecan be written as the union of algebraic sets (except by nitpickers who point out that the line is the union of the line itself and of any point on the line). In general, any algebraic set can be written in exactly one way as the union of smaller algebraic sets that in turn cannot be decomposed further. These basic building blocks arecalled irreducible algebraic sets or algebraic varieties.

Sometimes this is not exactly what one would naively expect. For instance, the curve in figure 2 has two con-nected components. The two parts are, however, not algebraic sets.An explanation is provided by looking at the complex solutions of this equation. We shall see later that these form a connected set, namely a torus (with a miss-ing point at infinity). We see two components when we look at the real solutions because we are taking across-section of this torus. In general, the zero setf = 0 is irreducible as an alge- braic set if and only iff is irreducible as a polynomial (or if it is the power of an irreducible polynomial). the implication in one direction is easy to see: if$f = gh$, then the zero set ofand of the zero set off his the union of the zero set of. g For many questions, keeping track only of the zero set is not enough. For instance, look at the polynomial$f = x^{2}(x - 1)(x - 2)^{3}$. It has degree 6 and three roots atand one usually says that$x = 0$,1,$2$. These roots behave differently, however, f \text{has a double root at} x = 0 and a triple root atx = 2. If we perturb f by adding a small numberf (x) + = 0 has two (complex) solutions near 0, oneto it, then the perturbed equation solution near 1 and three (complex) solutions near 2.Thus, these multiplicities carry important geometric meaning about the perturbation of the equation.Similarly, it is natural to say that while$x2y = 0 andxy3 =$0 define the same algebraic set (consisting of the two axes), the first “assigns multiplicity 2” to theand the other “assigns multiplicity 3” to thex-axis.y-axis equations. Consider the systemsx3 More complicated things can happen for systems of= y =0 in 3-space. Both define thex =zy-axis and it is2 = 0 and reasonable to say that the first does so with multiplic-ity 2, the second with multiplicity 3. There is, however,

a further difference. In the first case the multiplicity seems to “go in they-direction” and in the second case it seems to go in theother systems, likex -x-direction. We can also look atcy = y3 = 0, if we want to see more complicated behavior.Roughly speaking, a scheme is an algebraic set where we also keep track of the multiplicities and of the directions they occur in. Consider thexy-plane and consider the map that reflects across the origin. Thus a pointto(-x, -y). Let us try to glue each point(x, y)(x, y)is mappedto its image(-x,-y). What do we get? The right half-plane x ⩾ 0 is mapped to the left half-plane x ⩽ 0, so it is enough to work out what happens with the right half-plane. The positivey-axis is glued to the negative y- axis, and the resulting surface is a dunce cap (but less pointy). Algebraically, it is one half of the cone$z^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$. This cone looks nice and smooth except at the ver-tex. There it is more complicated, but the above construction shows that it can be obtained from a planeby a reflection across a point. More generally, suppose we take then-dimensional space Rnand finitely many symmetries of it. If we glue together points that moveinto each other, we again get an algebraic variety, most of whose points are smooth, but some of which aremore complicated. A variety made up of pieces like these is called anprecisely, we also keep track of which symmetries have orbifold. (When this is defined more been used.)

The study of stacks is strongly re com earlier times. 8 Curves, Surfaces, Threefolds As with any geometric object, one of the simplest ques-tions one can ask about a variety is: what is its dimension? As expected, a curve in the plane has dimen-sion 1, and a surface in 3-space has dimension 2. This seems quite simple until one writes down examples like$S = (x4 + y4 + z4 = 0)$, which is only the origin in R3. This example is, nonetheless, still two dimensional: the explanation is that we were looking at the wrong snapshot. Using complex numbers we can solve the equa-tion as$z =^{4} - x^{4} - y^{4}$, so the complex solutions ofx4 + y4 + z4 = 0 can be described by two indepen- dent variablesit is quite reasonable to say thatx, y and a dependent variable S is two dimensional.z.

what can we say about the perturbations of a given polynomial or power seriesf? xtom For instance, in the one-variable case, the polynomial xcan be perturbed asr if r < m. Every perturbation contain sxm + xr, which is equivalent xm, so ifalent tor > mx, then no perturbation ofr (because near the originx(xm)mwill be equiv-will be much larger than possible perturbations of$x^{r})$. Hence, up to equivalence, the set of allxm is {xr}: r ⩽ m. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that for any givenfor which the polynomials, there are only twenty-four different values of$xy(x^{2} - y^{2})+y^{2}(x^{2} - y^{2}η)$ and$xy(x^{2} - y^{2})+ηy^{2}(x^{2} - y^{2}) \text{are equivalent}$. (Indeed, both polynomials describe four lines through the ori-gin. The first one gives the lines$y = 0$, x = y , x = −y,$andx = −y$, and the second gives the same lines except thatη replaces . The linear part of any sup- posed equivalence gives a linear transformation map-ping the first set of four lines to the second. There are twenty-four ways to assign which line goes to whichline.)

Take any tangent of the conic andmove this so that it becomes the line at infinity. Then we get a parabola, which, in suitable coordinates, is givenby an equation$y = x2$. The polynomial map t \to  (t$, t2)$, with its inverse(x, y) \to  x, shows that this parabola is isomorphic to a line, so again has genus 0. ing is that smooth (and has genus 0) but it is singular at infinity.Cubics are quite a bit more complicated.

This can be seen through more-complicated representations. One can continue in this manner a bit longer, up to about genus 10, but no such explicit construction ispossible when the genus is large. 11 Moduli Spaces Let us go back to plane cubics, which we parametrized by the vector space V \text{of degree} - 3 \text{polynomials in} two variables.

Further more, thereis not much reason to distinguish$x^{3} + 2y^{3} + 1 from$ 2 x3 + y3 + 1, since they are obtained from each other by switching the two coordinate axes. More generally, as we have seen in the previous section, any cubic curve can be transformed into one given by an equation$y^{2} = f (x)$, where f = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. two more steps to take. First, one can set the leading coefficient of This is better but not yet optimal, and there aref to be 1. Indeed, substitute y = \sqrt{ay} and then divide the whole equation byx3 + · · ·.

Ifreplace them bya, b, and c have a common factora/m, b/m, and c/m, and (2) still holdsm, then we can for these new numbers. We may therefore suppose thata, b, and c are integers with no common factor. modular arithmetic reductions of We now reduce the above equation modulo 7 (seea and b modulo 7. The right-hand side of[III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic)). Denote b$\bar{y}a$ an$\bar{d}$ b the (2) is a multiple of 7, so it reduces to 0. We are left with

So the analysis of the solutions ofa,  ̄$b$ and seeing which ones satisfy the equation.

This being the case, are both multiples of 49. It follows that their$sum$, 7$c2$, is a multiple of 49 as well. Therefore, c2 is a multiple of 7, and this implies thattiple of 7. In particular, a, b, and c share a commonc itself is a mul- factor of 7. We have now arrived at the desired contra-diction, since we chosea, b, and c to have no common factor. Thus, the hypothesized solution leads us to a contradiction, so we are forced to conclude that there is not, in fact, any solution to (1) consisting of nonzero rational numbers.1 a polynomial equation like (2) is called aproblem In general, the determination of rational solutions to. We were able to dispose of (2) in a paragraph, Diophantine but that turns out to be the exception: in general, Dio-phantine problems can be extraordinarily difficult. For instance, we might modify the exponents in (2) and consider the equation

$x5 + y5 = 7z5$. (4)

I do not know whether (4) has any solutions in nonzero rational numbers or not; one can be sure, though, that determining the answer would be a substantial pieceof work, and it is quite possible that the most powerful techniques available to us are in sufficient to answer this simple question.More generally, one can take an arbitrary commutative mial equation has solutions inring [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)R, and ask whether a certain polyno-R. For instance, does$(2) \text{have a solution withring} C$[t]? (The answer is yes. We leave it as an exercisex, y, z in the polynomial the solution1.

The subject of arithmetic geometry has no pre- that it concerns the solution of Diophantine problems over subrings of number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields). (To be honest, a problem is usually called Diophantine only when R is a subring of a number field. However, the more general definition suits our current purposes.) With any particular equation like (2), one can associate each commutative ring infinitely many Diophantine problems, one for$R$. A central insight—in some sense the basic insight—of modern algebraic geometryis that this whole gigantic ensemble of problems can be treated as a single entity. This widening of scope reveals structure that is invisible if we consider each problem on its own. The aggregate we make of all these Diophantine problems is called a scheme. We will return to schemes later, and will try, without giving precise definitions, to convey some sense of what is meant by this not very suggestive term. of the immense progress that has taken place in arith-A word of apology: I will give only the barest sketch metic geometry in recent decades—there is simply toomuch to cover in an article of the present scope. I have chosen instead to discuss at some length the idea of a scheme, assuming, I hope, minimal technical know-ledge on the part of the reader. In the final section, I shall discuss some outstanding problems in arith-metic geometry with the help of the ideas developed in the body of the article. It must be conceded that the theory of schemes, developed by Grothendieck and his collaborators in the 1960 s, belongs to algebraic geometry as a whole, and not to arithmetic geometry alone. I think, though, that in the arithmetic setting, the useof schemes, and the concomitant extension of geometric ideas to contexts that seem “nongeometric” at first glance, is particularly central. 2 Geometry without Geometry Before we dive into the abstract theory of schemes, let us splash around a little longer among the polynomial equations of degree 2. Though it is not obvious from our discussion so far, the solution of Diophantine prob-lems is properly classified as part of geometry. Our goal here will be to explain why this is so. Suppose we consider the equation

$x2 + y2 = 1$. (5)

374

One can ask: which values ofx, y \in Qsatisfy (5)? This problem has a flavor very different from that of the pre-vious section. There we looked at an equation with no rational solutions. We shall see in a moment that (5), by contrast, has infinitely many rational solutions. The solutions resentative examples. (The four solutions$x = 0$, y = 1 and x = 3 5$, y = −(±4 51\text{are rep}-$,0) and(0,±1) are the ones that would be said, in the usual mathematical parlance, to be “staring you in the face.”)Equation (5) is, of course, immediately recognizable as “the equation of a circle.” What, precisely, do wemean by that assertion? We mean that the set of pairs of real numbers plotted in the Cartesian plane.(x, y) satisfying (5) \text{forms a circle when} trance in the figure of the circle. Now suppose that wewant to find more solutions to (5). One way to proceed So geometry, as usually construed, makes its enis as follows. Let P be the pointline through P of slopem. Then we have the following(1,0), and let L be a geometric fact. (G) The intersection of a line with a circle consists of either zero, one, or two points; the case of a single point occurs only when the line is tangent to the circle. From (G) we conclude that, unless L is the tangent line to the circle at P, there is exactly one point other than P where the line intersects the circle. In order to find solutions for this point. So suppose L is the line through(x$, y) to (5)$, we must determine coordinates(1,0) with slope equation ismy, which is to say it is the line L= m(x - 1). Then in order to find them whosexand the circle, we need to solve the simultaneous equa--coordinates of the points of intersection between Lm tions$y = m(x - 1) and x^{2} + y^{2} =$1; that is, we need to solve$x^{2} + m^{2}(x - 1)^{2} = 1 or$, equivalently,(1 + m2)x2 - 2 m2 x + (m2 - 1) = 0. (6) Of course$, (6) \text{has the solution}$ x = 1. \text{How many other} solutions are there? The geometric argument above leads us to believe that there is at most one solution to (6). Alternatively, we can use the following algebraic fact, which is analogous2 to the geometric fact (G). (A) The equation$(1 + m^{2})x^{2} - 2m^{2}x + (m^{2} - 1) = 0$ has either zero, one, or two solutions inx. because the notion of tangency is more subtle in the algebraic setting, as we will see in section 4 below.2. Note that (A), unlike (G), contains no mention of tangency; that is

A very nice feature of this construction is that it allows us to construct solutions to (5) not only over R but over smaller fields, like Q: it is evident that, when $\text{myielded by} (7)$. For example, takingis rational, so are the coordinates of the solutionm = 2 yields the solution(5) admits infinitely many solutions over(3 5$,-^{4}^{5})$. In fact, not only does (7) show us that Q, it also gives us an explicit way toof a variablem.

Still, polynomial equations like (5) with solutions that can be parametrized by one or more variables play a special role in arithmetic geometry; they are calledany measure the best-understood class of examples inrational varieties and constitute by the subject. ture of this discussion. We relied on geometric intu-ition (e.g., our knowledge of facts like (G)) to give us I want to draw your attention to one essential feaideas about how to construct solutions to (5). On theother hand, now that we have erected an algebraic justification for our construction, we can kick away our geometric intuition as needless scaffolding. It was a geometric fact about lines and circles thatto us that (6) should have only one solution other than suggested x = 1. However, once one has had that thought, one can proveof the purely algebraic statement (A), which involves nothat there is at most one such solution by means geometry whatsoever.

For instance, what if lots of different adjectives were sent to the same Is this a good idea? Well, there are certainly some set of nouns? Then our new viewpoint would be less precise than the old one. But it certainly seems that iftwo adjectives apply to exactly the same set of nouns, then it is fair to say that the adjectives are the same, orat least synonymous. instance, we can ask of two adjectives whether oneis What about relationships between adjectives? For stronger than another, in the way that “gigantic” is stronger than “large.” Is this relationship between adjectives still visible on the level of sets of nouns? The answer is yes: it seems fair to say thatthan”B precisely when Γ (A) is a subset of AΓ (B)is “stronger. In other words, what it means to say that “gigantic” is stronger than “large” is that all gigantic things are large, though some large things may not be gigantic.So far, so good. We have paid a price in technical difficulty: it is much more cumbersome to speakof infinite sets of nouns than it was to use simple, familiar adjectives. But we have gained something, too: “yellow” is not so clear-cut, but since our goal is to make this look like mathematics, let us pretend that every object in the world is either3. Of course, in real life, there are nouns whose relationship with definitively yellow or definitively not yellow.

the opportunity for generalization. Our theoretic i an—whom we may now call a “set-theoretic grammarian”— observes that there is, perhaps, nothing special aboutthe sets of nouns that happen to be of the formΓ (A) for some already known adjective A. Why not take a con- ceptual leap and“a set of nouns”? To avoid confusion with the usual redefine the word “adjective” to mean meaning of “adjective,” the theoretic i an might even use a new term, like “quality,” to refer to his new objects ofstudy. with. For example, there is a quality“sun”Now we have a whole new world of qualities to playwhich is stronger than “yellow,” and a quality${}$“school bus”, ${}$“sun” (not the same thing as the noun“sun”!) which is stronger than the qualities “yellow,” “gigantic,” “large,”and${}$“school bus”,“sun”. reconception of the notion of “adjective” is a goodidea. In fact, it probably is not, which is why set-theo-I may not have convinced you that, on balance, this retic grammar is not a going concern. The correspond-ing story in algebraic geometry, however, is quite a different matter.

3.2 Coordinate Rings

A warning: the next couple of sections will be difficult going for those not familiar with rings and ideals—such readers can either skip to section 4, or try to follow the discussion after reading[III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) (see also algebraic numbers rings, ideals, and modules[IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)). on, just “variety”) is the set of solutions over Let us recall that a complex affine variety (from now C to some finite set of polynomial equations.

(This is not supposed to be obvious.) It is a question of general interest, given some variety X, to understand the ring of polynomial functions that take points on X to complex numbers. This ring is called the coordinate ring of X , and is denoted Γ (X). regard it as a function defined on our particular vari-ety Certainly, given any polynomial in V.

C[x, y]; it is the ring obtained from C[x, y] by declaring two polynomials f and g to be the same function whenever they take the samevalue at every point of$V$.

It turns out that equivalence relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) on the set of fence is a multiple ofand ghave this property precisely when their differ-x2 +y2 -1. Thus, the ring of poly- nomial functions onideal generated byx2 V+is the quotient ofy2 - 1. This ring is denoted by C[x, y] by the$C$[x, y]/(x2 + y2 - 1). any variety. It is not hard to show that, if We have shown how to attach a ring of functions to X and Y are two varieties, and if their coordinate ringsΓ (Y ) are isomorphic[I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), then X andΓ (X)Y are inand a sense the “same” variety. It is a short step from this observation to the idea of abandoning the study of vari-eties entirely in favor of the study of rings. Of course, we are here in the position of the set-theoretic gram-marian in the parable above, with “variety” playing the part of “adjective” and “coordinate ring” the part of “setof nouns.” Happily, we can recover the geometric properties of a variety from the algebraic properties of its coordinate ring; if this were not the case, the coordinate ring would not be such a useful object! The relationship between geometry and algebra is a long story—and much of itbelongs to algebraic geometry in general, not arithmetic geometry in particular—but to give the flavor, let usdiscuss some examples. irreducibility A straightforward geometric property of a variety is. We say a variety X is reducible if X can be expressed as the union of two varieties neither of which is the whole of$X$. \text{For example}$, the X1 and X2$, variety

x2 = y2 (9)

in C2 is the union of the lines$x = y and x = −y$. A vari- ety is called irreducible if it is not reducible. All varieties are thus built up from irreducible varieties: the relation-ship between irreducible varieties and general varieties

Nei-$f = x - y$ ther of these functions is the zero function; note, for instance, that$f (1$, -1) \text{is nonzero}$, \text{as is} g(1$,1). Their product, however, is$x^{2} - y^{2}$, which is equal to zero onthe functions$X$; soΓ (X)f is not an integral domain. Notice thatand g that we chose are closely related to the decomposition of X as the union of two smaller varieties. Another crucial geometric notion is that of functions from one variety to another. (It is common practice tocall such functions “maps” or “morphisms”; we will use the three words interchangeably.) For instance, sup-pose that W is the variety in C3 determined by the equation xyz = 1. \text{Then the map} F$: C3$\to C2\text{defined by} F(x$, y, z) = 12 (x + yz)$, 2 i1 (x - yz) maps points of W to points of V . eties makes it very easy to see the maps between the varieties. We merely observe that if It turns out that knowing the coordinate rings of vari-$G$:$V \to V \text{is a}$ map between varieties$V^{1} and V^{2}$, and if f1 is a polyno-2 mial function ontion on V \text{that sends every point} V2, then we have a polynomial func-v to f (G(v)). This \text{function onis the function}1 V^1 is denoted byx + y on V , and G^*(f )F .

Moreover, this conception of algebraic geometry is themost simple and most clear for us, trained as we are in the wielding of “abstract” algebraic notions: rings, ideals, modules, etc. But it is precisely this “abstract” character that repulsed most contemporaries, discon-certed as they were by not being able to recover the corresponding geometric notions easily. Thus the influ-ence of the algebraic school remained very weak up until 1920.the first to dream of one vast algebraico-geometric con-. . . It certainly seems that Kronecker was struction comprising these two theories at once; thisdream has begun to be realized only recently, in our era, with the theory of schemes. Let us therefore move on to schemes.

3.3 Schemes

We have seen that each varietyΓ (X), and further more that the algebraic study of these X gives rise to a ring rings can stand in for the geometric study of varieties.But just as not every set of nouns corresponds to an adjective, not every ring arises as the coordinate ringof a variety. For example, the ring Z of integers is not the coordinate ring of a variety, as we can see by the following argument: for every complex numbera and every variety V , and therefore V , the constant function C ⊂ Γ (V ) for every varietya is a function on V . Since Z does not contain C as a subring, it is not the coordinate ring of any variety. marian’s coup de grâce. We know that some, but not all, Now we are ready to imitate the set-theoretic gramrings arise from geometric objects (varieties); and weknow that the geometry of these varieties is described by algebraic properties of these special rings. Why not, then, just consider every ring$R$to be a “geometric object” whose geometry is determined by algebraic properties of$R$? The grammarian needed to invent a

(In fact, we are hid-ing some technicalities; it is correct to say that So, after all this work, the definition of scheme isaffine schemes schemes will not interfere with the phenomena thatare rings. Restricting our attention to affine we are aiming to explain.) More interesting is to askhow we can carry out the task whose difficulty “disconcerted” the early algebraic geometers—how can weidentify “geometric” features of arbitrary rings? For instance, if R is supposed to be an arbitrary geo- metric object, it ought to have “points.” But what arethe “points” of a ring? Clearly we cannot mean by this the elements of the ring; for in the case$R = Γ (X)$, the elements ofwe need, given a point R are functionsp onon X, is some entity attached X, not points on X. What to the ring The key observation is that we can think of R that corresponds to p. p as a map fromΓ (X) to C: given a functionf from Γ (X) we map it to the complex numberf (p). This map is a homomorphism, called theatp. Since points on X give us homomorphisms on evaluation homomorphismΓ (X)ring R, a natural way to define the word “point” for the$= Γ (X)$, without using geometry, is to say that a “point” is a homomorphism from R to C. It turns out that the kernel of such a homomorphism is a maximal ideal, i.e., a proper ideal inlarger ideal except R itself. Moreover, every maximal R which is contained in no ideal ofway to describe the points of R arises from a point p Xofmight be to say that X. So a very concise they are the maximal ideals of R. A modern algebraic geometer would say that allpoints, not only the maximal ones. The “points” cor-prime ideals correspond to responding to the nonmaximal ideals are not pointsin the usual sense of the term; for instance, the point corresponding to the zero ideal (when it is prime) is the “generic point,” which is in one sense every where on X at once, and in another sense nowhere in par- ticular at all. This description sounds rather woolly, but on the algebraic side the zero ideal is something quite concrete—and in fact, having a precise notion of “generic point” turns out quite often to be useful inmaking a certain species of vague geometric argument into a rigorous proof.The definition we have arrived at makes sense for all rings R, and not just those of the form R = Γ (X). So we might define the “points” of a ring ideals. The set of prime ideals of R is given the name R to be its prime

To specify and f (y)f , I merely have toin Z. But I cannot choose these values arbitrarily: sincein R, it must be the case that f (x)2+f (y)(x2)2+-y12=-0 in1 =Z0. In other words, the pairtion over Z to the Diophantine equation(f (x)$, f (y)) \text{constitutes a solu} - x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$. What is more, the same argument shows that, forring S, a homomorphism f:$R \to S \text{yields a solutionany}$ over S to x2 + y2 = 1, and vice versa. In summary, for eachtween the set of ring homomorphisms from S, there is a one-to-one correspondence be-R to S, and solutions over$S to x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$. This behavior is what we have in mind when we say thatthe ring$R$“packages” information about Diophantine equations over different rings. esting geometric property of varieties can be computedby means of the coordinate ring, which means it can It turns out, just as one might hope, that every interbe defined not only for varieties but also for general schemes. We have already seen, for instance, that a variety domain. Thus, we say in general that a scheme Spec X is irreducible if and only if Γ (X) is an integral R is irreducible if and only ifmore precisely, if the quotient of R is an integral domain (or, R by its nilradical is an integral domain). One can speak of the connectedness of a scheme, its dimension, whether it is smooth, andso forth. All these geometric properties turn out, like irreducibility, to have purely algebraic descriptions. Infact, to the arithmetic geometer’s way of thinking, all these are, at bottom, algebraic properties.

For any ringx2 + y R2, we will denote by= 1. V (R) the set In particular, it is ahow large this set is: in other words, how many points If Ris a finite field finite Fp , the setset.

We might declare that Lgent to$V$; but this means that V would have multiple2 is tan-$379 \text{tangents at}$(1,0), since the vertical line x = 1 should surely still be considered a tangent. The alternative isto declare that L is not tangent to V; but then we are in the equally unsavory situation of having a linewhich, while not tangent to the circle2 V , intersects it at only one point. You are now beginning to see why Idid not include an algebraic definition of “tangent” in statement (A) above!This quandary illustrates the nature of arithmetic geometry nicely. When we move into novel contexts, like geometry over F , some features stay fixed (such as “a line intersects a circle in at most two points”), while others have to be discarded (such as “there exists$p$ exactly one line, which we may call the tangent line tothe circle at(1,0), \text{that intersects the circle at} (1$, 0) and$\text{no other point}”4). \text{to compute the number of points inall}, when \text{Notwithstanding} \text{these subtleties}, \text{we are now readyp} = 2 \text{one can check directly that} V (Fp )(. \text{First of}0,1) and(\text{this case}, \text{we assume for the rest of this section that}1, 0) \text{are the only two points in} V (F2). \text{Having treated pe qu at i on is odd}. \text{It follows from basic number theory that them}2 + 1 = 0 \text{has a solution in} F \text{if and only ifsuchp} ≡m1.

5.2 Rational Points on Curves

As we said above, some elliptic curves (which are curves of genus 1) have finitely many rational points, andothers have infinitely many. What is the situation for algebraic curves of other flavors?We have already encountered a curve of genus 0 with infinitely many points: namely, the curve On the other hand, the curve x2 + y2 = x27 \text{also has} + y2 = 1.$genus 0$, and a simple modification of the argument ofthe first section shows that this curve has no rational points.

For example, if When you prove that a set is finite, it is natural to f (x)the curveis a degree 6 polynomial with no repeated roots, y2 = f (x)turns out to have genus 2; so by Faltings’s theorem there are only finitely many pairs ofrational numbers(x$, y) satisfying y^{2} = f (x)$.

The current world record is held by the curve $y^{2} = 378 371 081x^{2}(x^{2} - 9)^{2} - 229 833 600(x^{2} - 1)^{2}$, which was constructed by Keller and Kulesz and has588 rational points. tion to a conjecture of Lang, which involves points Interest in the above question comes from its relaon higher-dimensional varieties. Caporaso, Harris, and Mazur showed that Lang’s conjecture implies a positive answer to the question above. This suggests a natural attack on the conjecture: if one can find a way toconstruct an infinite sequence of degree 6 polynomials f (x) so that the equations y = f (x) have ever more numerous rational solutions, then one has a disproofof Lang’s conjecture! No one has yet been successful at this task. If one could prove that the answer to the question above was affirmative, it would probably bol-ster our faith in the correctness of Lang’s conjecture,

though of course it would bring us no nearer to turning the conjecture into a theorem. In this article we have seen only a glimpse of the modern theory of arithmetic geometry, and perhaps Ihave over emphasized mathematicians’ successes at the expense of the much larger territory of questions, like Lang’s conjecture above, about which we remain wholly ignorant.

Introduction

Topology is concerned with the properties of a geomet-ric shape that are unchanged when we continuously deform it. In more technical terms, topology tries toclassify topological spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), where two spaces are considered the same if they are homeomorphic.Algebraic topology assigns numbers to a topological space, which can be thought of as the “number of holes”in that space. These holes can be used to show that two spaces are not homeomorphic: if they have differ-ent numbers of holes of some kind, then one cannot be a continuous deformation of the other. In the happi-est cases, we can hope to show the converse statement: that two spaces with the same number of holes (in some precise sense) are homeomorphic. with its origins in the nineteenth century. Before that, mathematics usually sought to solve problems exactly: Topology is a relatively new branch of mathematics, to solve an equation, to find the path of a falling body, to compute the probability that a game of dice will lead to bankruptcy. As the complexity of mathematical problems grew, it became clear that most problems would never be solved by an exact formula: a classic example is the problem, known as the three-body

problemof Earth, the Sun, and the Moon under the influence of[V.33](/part-05/the-three-body-problem), of computing the future movements gravity. Topology allows the possibility of making qual-itative predictions when quantitative ones are impossible. For example, a simple topological fact is that a tripfrom New York to Montevideo must cross the equator at some point, although we cannot say exactly where. 1 Connectedness and Intersection Numbers Perhaps the simplest topological property is one called connectedness. This can be defined in various ways, as we shall see in a moment, but once we have a notion of what it means for a space to be connected we can then divide a topological space up into connected pieces, called components. The number of these pieces is a simple but useful different numbers of connected components, then they invariant [I.4 §2.2](/part-01/general-goals): if two spaces have are not homeomorphic. of connectedness are equivalent. However, they can be generalized to give ways of measuring the number of For nice topological spaces, the different definitions holes in a space; these generalizations are interestingly different and all of them are important. notion of amapping The first interpretation of connectedness uses thef from the unit interval path, which is defined to be a continuous[0,1] to a given space X. (We think of f as a path from f (0) to f (1).) Let us declare two points ofpath from one to the other. The set of X to be equivalent if there is a equivalence classesof X and is written[I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) is called the set ofπ (X). This is a very natural way ofpath components defining the “number of connected pieces” into which X breaks up. One can generalize this notion by con-0 sidering mappings into X from other standard spaces such as spheres: this leads to the notion of homotopy groups, which will be the topic of section 2. based on functions from functions from a line segment into A different way of thinking about connectedness is X to the real line rather than X. Let us assume that we are in a situation where it makes sense to differentiate functions onopen subset of some Euclidean space, or more gener-X. For example, X could be an ally avalued functions onsmooth manifold X whose derivative is every where[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Consider all the realequal to zero: these functions form a real[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), \text{which we call H}0(X, R)(the “zeroth cohom-vector space ology group of Xwith real coefficients”). \text{Calculus tells us that if a function defined on an interval has deriva}-\text{tive zero}, \text{then it must be constant}, \text{but that is not true} 384 \text{when the domain has several connected pieces}: \text{all wecan say then is that the function is constant on each connected piece of} X. \text{The number of degrees of free}- \text{dom of such a function is therefore equal to the num}-\text{ber of connected pieces}, \text{so the dimension of the vector space} H0(X, R) \text{is another way to describe the number of connected components ofexample of a cohomology group}. \text{Cohomology will be} X. \text{This is the simplest discussed in section} 4.\text{We can use the idea of connectedness to prove a serious theorem of algebra}: \text{every real polynomial of odddegree has a real root}. \text{For example}, \text{there must be some real numberx} \text{such that} x3 + 3 x - 4 = 0. \text{The basic} \text{observation is that whenor a highly negative number}, \text{the termx is a large positive numberx}3 \text{is much bigger} (\text{in absolute value}) \text{than the other terms of the polyno} - mial. \text{Since this top term is an odd power ofx}, \text{we havef} (x) > 0 \text{for some positive number} x and f (x) < 0 \text{for some negative number then it would be a continuous mapping from the realx}. If f \text{were never equal to zero}, \text{line into the real line minus the origin}. \text{But the real lineis connected}, \text{while the real line minus the origin has two connected components}, \text{the positive and negative numbers}. \text{It is easy to show that a continuous map froma connected space} X \text{to another space} Y \text{must map} X \text{into just one connected component ofthis contradicts the fact thatf takes both positive and} Y: \text{in our case}, \text{negative values}. \text{Thereforef must be equal to zero at some point}, \text{and the proof is complete}.\text{This argument can be phrased in terms of the} “\text{intermediate value theorem}” \text{of calculus}, \text{which is indeedone of the most basic topological theorems}. \text{An equivalent reformulation of this theorem states that a continuous curve that goes from the lower half}-\text{plane tothe upper half}-\text{plane must cross the horizontal axis at some point}. \text{This idea leads toone of the most useful concepts in topology}. \text{let intersection numbers} M, \text{be a smooth oriented manifold}.

Alinking numbers knot is a path in space that, which comes begins and ends at the same point, or, more formally, aclosed connected one-dimensional submanifold of R3. Given any knot$S in R3 with K$as its boundary (see figure 3). Now let$K$, it is always possible to find a surface$L$ be a knot that is disjoint fromof K with Lis defined to be the intersection number K. The linking number ofnumbers imply that if the linking number of L with the surface S. The properties of intersection K with L is nonzero, then the knots sense that it is impossible to pull them apart.K and Lare “linked,” in the 2 Homotopy Groups If we remove the origin from the plane R2, then we obtain a new space that is different from the plane in a fundamental way: it has a hole in it. However, we cannot detect this difference by counting components, sinceboth the plane and the plane without the origin are connected. We begin this section by defining an invariant called the fundamental group, which does detect this kind of hole.As a first approximation, one could say that the elements of the fundamental group of a space X are loops, which can be formally defined as continuous functionsf from [0,1] to X \text{such that} f (0) = f (1). However, \text{this is not quite accurate}, \text{for two reasons}. \text{The first reason}, \text{which is extremely important}, \text{is that two loops} 385 \text{XXBBAAXX Figure} 4 \text{group and in higher homotopy groups}.\text{Multiplication} \text{in the fundamental are regarded as equivalent if one can be continuously deformed to the other while all the time staying inside Xbe more formal about this}, \text{let us suppose that}. \text{If this is the case}, \text{we say that they are homotopicf} . \text{Toandfis a collection of loops}1 \text{are two loops}. \text{Then af}shomotopyin X, \text{one for each between sf}0 \text{between and}0 f1 0 and 1, \text{such that the function} F(s$, t) = f (t) \text{is a con} - s$\text{tinuous function from}[0,1]2 to X. Thus, as s \text{increases from} 0 to 1, \text{the loop} f1. \text{If two loops are homotopic}, \text{then we count them asfs moves continuously from} f0 \text{to the same}. \text{So the elements of the homotopy group arenot actually loops but equivalence classes}, \text{or homotopy classes Even this is not quite correct}, \text{because for technical}, \text{of loops}. \text{reasons we need to impose an extra condition on our loops}: \text{that they all start from} (\text{and therefore end at})\text{a given point}, \text{called the base point}. If X \text{is connected}, \text{it turns out not to matter what this base point is}, \text{butwe need it to be the same for all loops}. \text{The reason for this is that it gives us a way to multiply two loops}: \text{ifis the base point and} A and B \text{are two loops that startx and end ataround} A \text{and then going aroundx}, \text{then we can define a new loop by going} B. \text{This is illustrated in figure} 4. \text{We regard this new loop as the product ofthe loops} A and B. \text{It is not hard to check that the homo}- \text{topy class of this product depends only on the homo}-\text{topy classes of} A and B, \text{and that the resulting binary operation turns the set of homotopy classes of loopsinto a group} [I.3 §2.1](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). It is this group that we call the fundamental group of$X$. \text{It is denoted} π1(X). the spaces we are likely to encounter. This makes it animportant way to distinguish one space from another.The fundamental group can be computed for most of First of all, for anyn the fundamental group of Rn is the trivial group with just one element, because any loop in Rn can be continuously shrunk to its base point. On the other hand, the fundamental group of R2\{0, \text{the plane with the origin removed}, \text{is isomorphic to the group} Z \text{of the integers}. \text{This tells us that we can associate withany loop in} R2\ {0} \text{an integer that does not change} 386 \text{if we modify the loop in a continuous way}. \text{This inte}-\text{ger is known as the winding number}. Intuitively, \text{the winding number measures the total number of times that the mapping goes around the origin}, \text{with coun}-\text{ter clockwise circuits counting positively and clockwise ones negatively}. \text{Since the fundamental group ofis not the trivial group}$, R2$\ {0} \text{cannot be homeomor} - R2 \ {0}\text{phic to the plane}. (\text{It is an interesting exercise to try to find an elementary proof of this result}—\text{that is}, \text{a proofthat does not use}, \text{or implicitly reconstruct}, \text{any of the machinery of algebraic topology}. \text{Such proofs do exist}, \text{but it is tricky to find them}.) A \text{classic application of the fundamental group is to prove}[V.13](/part - 05/the - fundamental - theorem - of - algebra), which states that every nonconstant polyno-the fundamental theorem of algebra mial with complex coefficients has a complex root. (Theproof is sketched in the article just cited, though the fundamental group is not explicitly mentioned there.) of “one-dimensional holes” that a space has. A basic example is given by the circle, which has fundamental The fundamental group tells us about the number group Z, just as R2\ {0} does, and for essentially the same reason: given a path in the circle that begins and ends at the same point, we can see how many times itgoes around the circle. In the next section we shall see some more examples.Before we think about higher-dimensional holes, we first need to discuss one of the most important topolog-ical spaces: then-dimensional sphere. For any natural number$n$, this is defined to be the set of points in R$n^{+1}$ at distance 1 from the origin. It is denoted0-sphere S0 consists of two points, the 1-sphere Sn. Thus$, the S1 is$ the circle, and the 2-sphere S2 is the usual sphere, like the surface of Earth. Higher-dimensional spheres take alittle bit of getting used to, but we can work with them in the same way that we can with lower-dimensional spheres. For example, we can construct the 2-sphere from a closed two-dimensional disk by identifying all the points on the boundary circle with each other. Inthe same way, the 3-sphere can be obtained from a solid three-dimensional ball by identifying all the points onthe boundary 2-sphere. A related picture is to think of the 3-sphere as being obtained from our familiar three-dimensional space R3 by adding one point “at infinity.”Now let us think about the familiar sphere$S2$. This has trivial fundamental group, since any loop drawnon the sphere can be shrunk to a point. However, this does not mean that the topology of$S^{2} \text{is trivial}$. \text{It just} means that in order to detect its interesting properties

IV. Branches of Mathematics

we need a different invariant. And it is possible to basesuch an invariant on the observation that even if loops can always be shrunk, there are other maps that cannot. Indeed, the sphere itself cannot be shrunk to a point.To say this more formally, the identity map from the sphere to itself is not homotopic to a map from thesphere to just one point.

We have already observed that these have the same fundamental group, A good example is when X is the unit circle and Y and commented that it was “for essentially the same reason.” Now we can be more precise. Let$f$:$X \to Y$ be the map that takes(x, y) belongs to the circle and the second to the plane).(x, y) to (x, y)(where the first Let$g$: Y \to  X be the map that takes (u$, v) to\sqrt{u}2u + v2$, \sqrt{u}2 v + v2.

As forf ◦g, it is given by the same formula aseach radial line to the point where that line inter sec tsg itself. More geometrically, it takes the points on the unit circle.

homotopy equivalent to the circle.Figure 5 Some spaces that are equivalent if they have the same number of holes ofall types. This is a more flexible notion of “having the Very roughly speaking, two spaces are homotopy same shape” than the notion of homeomorphism. For example, Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic to each other, but they are all homo-topy equivalent. Indeed, they are all homotopy equivalent to a point: such spaces are calledand one thinks of them as the spaces that have no contractible, hole of any sort. The circle is not contractible, but it is homotopy equivalent to many other natural spaces: the plane R2 minus the origin (as we have seen), the cylinder S1 \times  R, the compact cylinder S1 \times  [0, 1], and even the Möbius strip (see figure 5). Most invariants in algebraic topology (such as homotopy groups and cohomology groups) are the same for any two spaces that are homotopy equivalent. Thus, knowing that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers tells us that the same is true for the various homotopy equivalent spaces just mentioned. roughly speaking, this says that all these spaces have “one basic one-dimensional hole.” 3 Calculations of the Fundamental Group and Higher Homotopy Groups To give some more feeling for the fundamental group, let us review what we already know and look at a few more examples. The fundamental group of the2-sphere, or indeed of any higher-dimensional sphere, is trivial. The two-dimensional torus mental group Z2= Z\times Z. Thus, a loop in the torus deter-S1 \times S1 has funda- mines two integers, which measure how many times itwinds around in the meridian direction and how many in the longitudinal direction.The fundamental group can also be non-Abelian; that is, we can haveab ≠ ba for some elements a and b of the fundamental group.

But this is completely untrue for different folds with trivial fundamental group, and we need more simply connected manifolds, meaning man i invariants to be able to distinguish between them. (Tobegin with, the 4-sphere S4 \text{and the product} S2 \times S2 are both simply connected. More generally, we can takethe connected sum of any number of copies of$S^{2} \times S^{2}$, obtained by removing 4-balls from these manifolds and identifying the boundary 3-spheres. These 4-manifolds are all simply connected, and yet no two of them are homeomorphic or even homotopy equivalent.) An obvious way in which we might try to distinguish different spaces is to useindeed this works in simple cases. For example, higher homotopy groups, andπ of the connected sum ofphic to Z2 r .

A first In general, however, the homotopy groups are not a hint of this was Hopf’s 1931 discovery that$π^{3}(S^{2}) is$ isomorphic to the integers: it is clear that the 2-spherehas a two-dimensional hole, as measured by$π (S^{2})$ Z, but in what sense does it have a three-dimensional2 hole? This does not correspond to our naive view of what such a hole should be. The problem of com-puting the homotopy groups of spheres turns out to be one of the hardest in all of mathematics: some ofwhat we know is shown in table 1, but despite massive efforts the homotopy groups$π (S^{2})$, for example, arei

Fortunately, there is a different way to measure the number of holes in a topological space: homology and cohomology groups. The definitions are more subtle than the definition of homotopy groups, but the groups turn out to be easier to compute and are for this reason much more commonly used. Recall that elements of thenth homotopy groupπcontinuous maps from then(X) of a topological spacen-sphere to X are represented by X . Let X be a manifold, for simplicity. There are two key differences between homotopy groups and homology groups. Thefirst is that the basic objects of homology are more general thann-dimensional spheres: every closed orientedan element of then-dimensional submanifold nth homology group of A of X determines X, Hn(X). \text{This might make homology groups seem much big}-\text{ger than homotopy groups}, \text{but that is not the case}, \text{because of the second major difference between homo}-\text{topy and homology}. \text{As with homotopy}, \text{the elements of the homology groups are not the submanifolds themselves but equivalence classes of submanifolds}, \text{butthe definition of the equivalence relation for homology makes it much easier for two of these submanifolds to be equivalent than it is for two spheres to behomotopic}. \text{here are some examples that convey some of its flavor}.\text{We shall not give a formal definition of homology}, \text{but Leta circle that goes around the origin}. \text{If we continuously} X \text{be the plane with the origin removed and let} A \text{be deform this circle}, \text{we will obtain a new curve that is homotopic to the original circle}, \text{but with homology wecan do more}. \text{For instance}, \text{we can start with a continuous deformation that causes two of its points to touch and turns it into a figure eight}. \text{One half of this figure eight will have to contain the origin}, \text{but we can leave} 390 Table 1 \text{The first few homotopy groups of spheres}.

(More generally, the definition of homology allows us to add up any collection of sub-manifolds, whether or not they overlap.) Here are some simple examples of homology groups, which, unlikethe fundamental group, are always Abelian. The homology groups of a sphere,$H (S^{n})$, are isomorphic to thei

integers Z fori = 0 \text{and for i} = n, and 0 otherwise. This contrasts with the complicated homotopy groups of the sphere, and better reflects the naive idea thatthen-sphere has one n-dimensional hole and no other holes. Note that the fundamental group of the circle, the group of integers, is the same as its first homology group. More generally, for any path-connected space, the first homology group is always the “Abelianization”of the fundamental group (which is formally defined to be its largest Abelian quotient). For example, the funda-mental group of the plane with two points removed is the free group on two generators, while the first homol-ogy group is the free Abelian group on two generators, or Z2. H The homology groups of the two-dimensional torus(S1\times S1) are isomorphic to Z for i = 0, to Z2 for i = 1, i

and to Z fori = 2. All of this has geometric meaning. The zeroth homology group of any space is isomorphic to Zr for a space X with r connected components. So the fact that the zeroth homology group of the torus is isomorphic to Z means that the torus is connected. Any closed loop in the torus determines an element of thefirst homology group Z2, which measures how many times the loop winds around the meridian and longitu-dinal directions of the torus. And finally, the homology of the torus in dimension 2 is isomorphic to Z because the torus is a closed orientable manifold. That tells usthat the whole torus defines an element of the second homology group of the torus, which is in fact a gen-erator of that group. By contrast, the homotopy group

Themain reason for this is the existence of results that tell you the homology groups of a space that is built up from smaller pieces in terms of the homology groups ofthose pieces and their intersections. Another important property of homology groups is that they are “functo-rial” in the sense that a continuous mapf from a space X to a space Y leads in a natural way to a homomor- phism defined to bef* from[f (A)]Hi(X).

It is a nontrivial trivial line bundle line bundle; that is, it is not isomorphic to the S1 \times  R. (There are many ways of con- structing it: one is to take the strip\\{(x}$, y)\\: 0$⩽ x ⩽ 1\text{and identify each point}(0$, y) \text{with the point} (1, -y)$. The base space of this line bundle is the set of all points$(x, 0)$, \text{which is a circle since} (0, 0) and (1, 0) have been identified.) bundle easily define this bundle by considering If M is a smooth manifold of dimension T M \to  M is a vector bundle of rankn M, itsnas a sub-. We can tangent manifold of some Euclidean space RN . (Every smooth manifold can be embedded into Euclidean space.)

A section of the tangent bundle ofvector field. We can draw a vector field on a given manifold by putting an arrow (possiblyof zero length) at every point of the manifold. In order to classify smooth manifolds, it is important to study their tangent bundles, and in particular to see whether they are trivial or not. Some manifolds, like the circle S1 \text{and the torus} S1 \times S1, do have trivial tangent bundle. The tangent bundle of ann-manifold Mare linearly independent at every point ofis trivial if and only if we can findnvector fields that M . So we can prove that the tangent bundle is trivial just by writing down such vector fields; see figure 12 for the circle orthe torus. But how can we show that the tangent bundle of a given manifold is nontrivial?

Figure 13 The hairy ball theorem.

One way is to use intersection numbers. Let M be a closed oriented image of the “zero-section” inside the tangent bundlen-manifold. We can identify M with the T Mzero vector at that point. Since the dimension of, the section that assigns to every point of MT Mtheis precisely double that oftion numbers in section 1 gives a well-defined integer M, the discussion of intersec-M2 = M · M, the self-intersection number of M inside T M; this is called the Euler characteristicχ(M). By the definition of intersection numbers, for any vector field v Euler characteristic ofon M that meets the zero-section transversely, the M is equal to the number of zeros$of$ v, counted with signs. As a result, if the Euler characteristic of M is not zero, then every vector field onsection; in other words, every vector field on M must meet the zero-M must equal zero somewhere. The simplest example occurs when$M \text{is the} 2 - sphere S^{2}$. We can easily write down a vector field (for example, the one pointing towardthe east along circles of latitude, which vanishes at the north and south poles) whose intersection number with the zero-section is 2. Therefore the 2-sphere has Euler characteristic 2, and so every vector field on the 2-sphere must vanish somewhere. This is a famous the-orem of topology known as the “hairy ball theorem”: it is impossible to comb the hair on a coconut (seefigure 13). classes This is the beginning of the theory of, which measure how nontrivial a given vector characteristic bundle is. There is no need to restrict ourselves to the tangent bundle of a manifold. For any oriented vector bundle define a cohomology class E of rank n on a topological spaceχ(E) in Hn(X), the X, we can Euler classthe Euler class of, which vanishes if the bundle is trivial. Intuitively, E is the cohomology class represented by the zero set of a general section of E, which (for example, ifn submanifold of X is a manifold) should be a codimension-X, since X has codimension n in E. Ifclass of the tangent bundle in X is a closed oriented n-manifold, then the Euler Hn(X) = Z is the Euler characteristic of X.

tic classes was the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, generalized One of the inspirations for the theory of character is to all dimensions in the 1940 s. The theorem expresses the Euler characteristic of a closed manifold with a Riemannian metric as the integral over the manifold of acertain curvature function. More broadly, a central goal of differential geometry is to understand how the geo-metric properties of a Riemannian manifold such as its curvature are related to the topology of the manifold. (that is, bundles where the fibers are complex vector spaces) turn out to be particularly convenient: indeed, The characteristic classes for complex vector bundles real vector bundles are often studied by constructing the associated complex vector bundle.

The top Chern class,$c^{n}(E)$, is simply the Euler class of E: thus, it is the first obstruction to finding a section of E that is every where nonzero. The more general Chern classes have a similar interpretation. For any 1⩽ j ⩽ n, choosej general sections of E.

This phenomenon shows the power of looking at geomet-ric problems in terms of vector bundles, and thus ultimately in terms of linear algebra. Among the classic applications of K-theory is the proof, by Bott, Ker- vaire, and Milnor, that the 0-sphere, the 1-sphere, the 3-sphere, and the 7-sphere are the only spheres whose tangent bundles are trivial. This has a deep algebraic consequence, in the spirit of the fundamental theoremof algebra: the only dimensions in which there can be a real division algebra (not assumed to be commutative or even associative) are 1, 2, 4, and 8. There areindeed division algebras of all four types: the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions(see quaternions, octonions, and normed division algebras [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena)). bra of dimension trivial tangent bundle.

The definition is very geometric: the complex M are generated by mappings of manifolds (with a complex structure onthe tangent bundle) into M . The relations say that any manifold counts as zero if it is the boundary of someother manifold. For example, the union of two circles would count as zero if you could find a cylinder whoseends were those circles. than eitherfar into the structure of a topological space, but at It turns out that complex cobordism is much richer K-theory or ordinary cohomology. It sees the cost of being difficult to compute. Over the past thirty years, a whole series of cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology and Morava have been constructed as “simplifications” of complex K-theories, cobordism: there is a constant tension in topology between invariants that carry a lot of information and invariants that are easy to compute. In one direction, complex cobordism and its variants provide the most powerful tool for the computation and understand-ing of the homotopy groups of spheres. Beyond the range where Bernoulli numbers appear, we see deeper number theory such as modular forms [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms). In another direction, the geometric definition of complex cobordism makes it useful in algebraic geometry. 7 Conclusion The line of thought introduced by pioneering topolo-gists like riemann [VI.49] is simple but powerful. Try to translate any problem, even a purely algebraic one, into geometric terms. Then ignore the details of the geometry and study the underlying shape or topologyof the problem. Finally, go back to the original problem and see how much has been gained. The funda-mental topological ideas such as cohomology are used

Taubes 1 Smooth Manifolds This article is about classifying certain objects called smooth manifolds, so I need to start by telling you what they are. A good example to keep in mind is the surface of a smooth ball. If you look at a small portion ofit from very close up, then it looks like a portion of a flat plane, but of course it differs in a radical way froma flat plane on larger distance scales. This is a general phenomenon: a smooth manifold can be very convoluted, but must be quite regular in close-up. This “local regularity” is the condition that each point in a manifold belongs to a neighborhood that looks like a portionof standard Euclidean space in some dimension. If the dimension in question isfold, then the manifold itself is said to have dimensiond for every point of the mani-d. A schematic of this is shown in figure 1.What does it mean to say that a neighborhood “looks like a portion of standard Euclidean space”? It meansthat there is a “nice” one-to-one mapφ from the neigh- borhood into Rd (with its usual notion of distance). One can think ofborhood with points inφas “identifying” points in the neigh-R$d$: that is, xis identified with coordinate chartφ(x). If we do this, then the functionof the neighborhood, and any chosenφ is called a basis for the linear functions on the Euclidean space iscalled a coordinate system. The reason for this is that φ allows us to use the coordinates in Rd to label points in the neighborhood: ifx belongs to the neighborhood,

For example, Europe is part of the surface of a sphere. Atypical map of Europe identifies each point in Europe with a point in flat, two-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, a square grid labeled with latitude and longitude. These two numbers give us a coordinate sys-tem for the map, which can also be transferred to a coordinate system for Europe itself. Now, here is a straightforward but central observation. Suppose that intersect, and suppose that functions M and N are two neighborhoods thatφ:$M \to R^{d} andψ$: N \to  Rd are used to give them each a coordinate chart. Then the intersection M ∩N is given two coordi- nate charts, and this gives us an identification between the open regions$φ(M ∩ N) and ψ(M ∩ N) of R^{d}$: given a pointin the second isxin the first region, the corresponding point$ψ(φ^{-1}(x))$. This composition of maps is called a coordinates from one of the charts on the intersecting transition function, and it tells you how the region relate to those of the other. The transition func-tion is a homeomorphism [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) between the regions

The word “topological” is used in order to indicate that thereare no constraints on the coordinate-chart transition functions apart from the basic one that they shouldbe continuous. However, some continuous functions are quite unpleasant, so one typically introduces extra constraints in order to limit the distorting effect thatthe transition functions can have on a rectangular coordinate grid.Of prime interest here is the case where the transition functions are required to be differentiable to all orders. If a manifold has a collection of charts for which all the transition functions are infinitely differentiable, then it is said to have aa smooth manifold. Smooth manifolds are especially smooth structure, and it is called interesting because they are the natural arena for calculus. Roughly speaking, they are the most general con-text in which the notion of differentiation to any order makes intrinsic sense.A function f, defined on a manifold, is said to be differentiable Rd , the functionif, given any of its coordinate chartsg(y) = f (φ-1(y))(which is definedφ: N \to\text{on a region ofis impossible on a manifold if it does not admit charts Rd}) is \text{differentiable}[I.3 §5.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). \text{Calculus with} \text{differentiable} \text{transition functions}, \text{because a func}-\text{tion that might appear} \text{differentiable} \text{in one chart will not}, \text{in general}, be \text{differentiable} \text{when viewed from a neighboring chart}. point. \text{Consider the following two coordinate charts ofa neighborhood of the origin in the real line}. \text{The first is Here is a one}-\text{dimensional example to illustrate this the obvious chart that simply represents a real numberx by itself}.

(This is the same function asf only because φ happens to be the very special map that takes each number toitself.) Thus, the eminently differentiable functionh on one coordinate chart translates into the continuous butnot differentiable functiong on the other. Suppose one is given a topological manifold M with two sets of charts, both of which have infinitely differ-entiable transition functions. Then each set of charts gives us a smooth structure on the manifold. Of great importance is the fact that these two smooth structures can be fundamentally different. Ktiable To see what this means, let us call the sets of chartsandif it is differentiable from the viewpoint of L. Given a function f , let us call it K-differen-K, andpoint of L-differentiable L.

The discussion that fol- lows will be almost entirely about compact manifolds. As some of the examples below will demonstrate, thestory for compact manifolds is less convoluted than the analogous story for noncompact ones. For sim-plicity I shall often use the word “manifold” to mean “compact manifold”; it will be clear from the context if noncompact manifolds are also being discussed.

2.2 Dimension 1

There is only one compact, connected, one-dimensional topological manifold, namely the circle. Moreover, the circle has just one smooth structure. Here is one way torepresent this structure. Take as a representative circle the unit circle in theall points(x, y) with x2 xy+ y-plane, that is, the set of2 = 1. This can be cov- ered by two overlapping intervals, each of which cov-ers slightly more than half of the circle. The intervals Ututes a coordinate chart.

Each interval consti-U , can be parametrized in a continuous fashion by taking the1 angle of a given point as measured counterclockwis efrom the positivex-axis. For example, the point (1, 0) has angle 0, and the point(-1,0) \text{has angle} π. \text{In order} to parametrize angleπ at the negative U2 by angle, you will have to start withx-axis. If you move around U , varying this angle continuously, then when you reachthe point(1,0) you will have parametrized it as a point2 in As you can see, the arcs U2 using the angle 2π.

For that matter, any manifold of dimension greater than 1 has smooth loops. Earlier, it was asserted that there is just one smooth, compact, connected, one-dimensional manifold, so all of these loops must be considered the“same.” Why is this? it might appear were it sitting in some larger space.Here is the answer. We often think of a manifold as For example, we might imagine a circle sitting in theplane, or sitting knotted in three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, the notion of “smooth manifold”introduced above is an intrinsic one, in the sense that it does not depend on how the manifold is placed insidea higher-dimensional space. Indeed, it is not even necessary for there to be a higher-dimensional space at all. In the case of the circle, this can be said in the following way. The circle can be placed as a loop in the plane, or as a knot in 3-space, or whatever. Each view of the circle in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space defines a collec-tion of functions that are considered differentiable: one just takes the differentiable functions of the coordinates of the big Euclidean space and restricts them to thecircle. As it turns out, any one such collection defines the same smooth structure on the circle as any other. Thus, the smooth structures that are provided by these different views of a circle are all the same, even though

For that matter, how is it proved that there is but a single compact topological manifold How is it proved that there is only one smooth strucin dimension 1? Since this article is not meant to pro-vide proofs, these questions are left as serious exercises with the following advice. Think hard about the definitions and, for the smooth-manifold question, use some calculus.

2.3 Dimension 2

The story for two-dimensional, connected, compact manifolds is much richer than that for dimension 1. In the first place, there is a basic dichotomy between two kinds of manifold: orientable and nonorientable.Roughly speaking, this is the distinction between manifolds that have two sides and those that have just one. To give a more formal definition, a two-dimen-sional manifold is called orientable if every loop in the manifold that does not cross itself or have any kinkshas two distinct sides. This is to say that there is no path from one side of the loop to the other that avoidsthe loop yet remains very close to it. The Möbius strip (see figure 6) is not orientable because there are pathsfrom one side of the central loop to the other that do not cross the central loop yet remain very closeto it. The orientable, compact, connected, topological, two-dimensional manifolds are in one-to-one corre-spondence with a collection of fundamental foods: the apple, the doughnut, the two-holed pretzel, the three-holed pretzel, the four-holed pretzel, and so on (see figure 7). Technically, they are classified by an integer, called the genus.

To say that this classifies them is to say thattwo such manifolds are the same if and only if they have the same genus. This is a theorem due to poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912).As it turns out, every topological two-dimensional manifold has exactly one smooth structure, so the listin figure 7 is the same as the list of the smooth orientable two-dimensional manifolds. Here one should keep in mind that the notion of a smooth manifold is intrinsic, and therefore independent of how the man-ifold is represented as a surface in 3-space, or in any other space. For example, the surfaces of an orange, a banana, and a watermelon each represent embed-ded images of the two-dimensional sphere, the leftmost example in figure 7. plays a key role when it comes to classifying manifoldsof higher dimensions. Notice that the two-holed torus The shapes illustrated in figure 7 suggest an idea that can be viewed as the result of taking two one-holed tori, cutting disks out of both, gluing the results together across their boundary circles, and then smoothing the corners. This operation is depicted in figure 8. This sort of cutting and gluing operation is an example of whatis called a surgery. The analogous surgery can also be done with a one-holed torus and a two-holed torus to obtain a three-holed torus. And so on. Thus, all of the oriented two-dimensional manifolds can be built using standard surgeries on copies of just two fundamental building blocks: the one-holed torus and the sphere. Here is a nice exercise to test your understanding ofthis process. Suppose that you perform a surgery, as in figure 8, on a sphere and another manifold that the resulting manifold is the same, with regard to M. Prove its topological and smooth structure, as M. sional manifolds can be built using a version of surgery As it turns out, all of the nonorientable two-dimen-

The correspondence comes from an$(n + 1)-$ dimensional version of the stereographic projection that is used for maps of the Earth’s polar regions.

With this goal in mind, suppose that Ihave specified some “standard” geometric structure$S$ for the ball in Rn to serve as a model of an exception- ally desirable structure. This could be one of the ones I have just defined or some other favorite. This leadsto a corresponding notion of the structure S for a com- pact manifold. Roughly speaking, one says that a geo-metric structure on a manifold is of the type S if every point in the manifold feels as though it belongs to the unit ball with the structure structure S on the ball to provide coordinate charts that S, that is, if one can use the respect the geometric structure on the manifold. To bemore precise, suppose that I am defining a coordinate system in a small neighborhood functionφ:$N \to R^{d}$. If I can always do this in such a N of x by means of a way that the imagethat the distance between any two pointsφ(N) lies inside the ball, and suchx and y in Nφ(y)equals the distance between their images, defined in terms of the structure S on the ball,φ(x) and then I will say that the manifold has structure of type In particular, a geometric structure is said to be Euclid-S. eanball is Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic, respectively., spherical, or hyperbolic when the structure on the For example, the sphere in any dimension has a spherical geometric structure (as it should!). As it turnsout, every two-dimensional manifold has a geometric structure that is either spherical, Euclidean, or hyper-bolic. Moreover, if it has a structure of one of these types, then it cannot have one of a different type. In particular, the sphere has a spherical structure, but not a Euclidean or hyperbolic structure. Meanwhile, the torus

402

in dimension 2 has a Euclidean geometric structure butonly a Euclidean one, and all of the other manifolds listed in figure 7 have hyperbolic geometric structures and only hyperbolic ones.William Thurston had the great insight to realize that three-dimensional manifolds might be classifiable using geometric structures. In particular, he made what was known as thesays, roughly speaking, that every three-dimensional geometrization conjecture, which manifold is made up of “nice” pieces: Every smooth three-dimensional manifold can be cut ina canonical fashion along a predetermined set of two dimensional spheres and one-holed tori so that each ofthe resulting parts has precisely one of a list of eight possible geometric structures. Euclidean, and hyperbolic ones. These plus the otherfive are, in a sense that can be made precise, those The eight possible structures include the spherical, that are maximally symmetric. The other five are associ-ated with various lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory), as are the listed three.Since its proof by Perelman, the geometrization conjecture has come to be known as the geometrization theorem. As I shall explain in a moment, this provides a satisfactory resolution of the three-dimensional part of the quest set out at the end of section 1. This isbecause a manifold with one of the eight geometric structures can be described in a canonical fashion using group theory. As a result, the geometrization theorem turns the classification issue for manifolds into a ques-tion that group theory can answer. What follows is an indication of how this comes about.Each of the eight geometric structures has an associated ture. For example, in the case of the spherical structure, model space which has the given geometric structhe model space is the three-dimensional sphere. For the Euclidean structure, the model space is the three-dimensional Euclidean space. For the hyperbolic structure, it is the hyperbola in the four-dimensional Euclid-ean space, where the coordinates(x, y, z, t) obey t2 =$1$+x2 + y2 + z2. \text{In all of the eight cases}, \text{the model space has a canonical group of self}-\text{maps that preserve the distance between any two pairs of points}. \text{In the Euclidean case}, \text{this group is the group of translations and rotations of the three}-\text{dimensional Euclidean space}. \text{In the spherical case}, \text{it is the group of rotations of thefour}-\text{dimensional Euclidean space}, \text{and in the hyperbolic case}, \text{it is the group of Lorentz} \text{transformations} \text{of four}-\text{dimensional Minkowski space}. \text{The associated IV}. \text{Branches of Mathematics group of self}-\text{maps is called thegiven geometric structure}. \text{isometry group for the The connection between manifolds and group theory arises because a certain set of discrete subgroups of the isometry group of any one of the eight model spaces determines a compact manifold with the correspond}-\text{ing geometric structure}. (A \text{subgroup is called discrete if every point in the subgroup is isolated}, \text{meaning that it belongs to a neighborhood that contains no other points from the subgroup}.) \text{This compact manifold is obtained as follows}. \text{Two points space are declared to be equivalentx andif there is an isom} - y \text{in the model etry} T , \text{belonging to the subgroup}, \text{such that} T x = y . \text{In other words}, \text{isometries from the subgroup}. \text{It is easy to check thatx is equivalent to all its images under this notion of equivalence is a genuine relation} [I.2 §2.3](/part - 01/language - and - grammar).

Given a point possible images under translations from the subgroupt in the real line, the are all the numbers of the form$t + 2nπ$, where n \text{is an} integer, so one regards two real numbers as equivalent if they differ by a multiple of 2π, and the equivalence class of$t is {t + 2nπ}$: n \in Z. One can associate with this equivalence class the point(x, y) = (\cos  t, \sin  t) in the circle, since adding a multiple of 2 not affect either its sine or its cosine.

In Even before Perelman’s work there was a tremendous order to discuss this evidence, a small digression isrequired to give some of the background. First, I need to bring in the notion of asphere. A link is the name given to a finite disjoint link in the three-dimensional

(Think of the knot as the copper in an insu-I also need the notion of surgery on a link. To this end, lated wire and view the solid tube as the copper plusthe surrounding insulation.) Notice that the boundary of any given component tube is really a copy of ourone-holed torus from figure 7. Therefore, removing any one of the tubes leaves a tubular-shaped missing region from the three-dimensional sphere whose boundary is a torus.Now, to define a surgery, imagine removing a knotted tube and then gluing it back in a different way. That is, imagine gluing the boundary of the tube to the boundary of the resulting missing region using an identifica-tion that is not the same as the original. For example, take the “unknot,” a standard round circle in a given plane, here viewed as living inside a coordinate chart of the three-dimensional sphere. Take out the solidtube around it, and then replace the tube by gluing the boundary in the “wrong” way, as follows. Consider the left most torus in figure 11 as the boundary of the complement of the tube in R3. Consider the middle torus as the inside of the tube. The “wrong” gluing identifies the circles marked “R” and “L” on the leftmost torus with their counterparts on the middle torus. The result-ing space is a three-dimensional manifold which turns out to be the product of the circle with the two-dimensional sphere.

Now consider the product manifold, points(x, y), where1 Snx\times is in one copy of (Sn)n. This is the set of pairs of+1 Sn and y is in another. This product manifold has dimension 2 A standard picture of Sn \times  Sn has two distinguish edn. copies of Sn inside it, one consisting of all points of the formsisting of all points(x, y) with(x, y)y = (1 with, 0, . . . )x =and the other con-(1,0, . . . ). Let us call the first copy SR \text{and the second one} SL. Of partic- ular interest here is the fact that precisely one point, the point((1 S$, 0 R, . . . )$, (\text{and SL}1, \text{intersect in}0, . . . )). By the way, in then = 1 case, the space S1 \times  S1 is the doughnut in figure 7. The one-dimensional spheres S and S inside it are the circles that are drawn in the leftmost diagram in figure 11.RIf you are with me so far, suppose now that an L advanced alien en route from Arcturus to the galactic center kidnaps you and drops you into some unknown, 2 n-dimensional manifold. You suspect that it is Sn\times Sn, but are not sure. One reason that you suspect this tobe the case is that you have found a pair ofn-dimen- sional spheres in it, one you callcall M . Unfortunately, they intersect in 2 MR and the other you N + 1 points, L where N > 0. You would be less nervous about things if you could find a pair of different spheres that intersect precisely once. So you wonder whether perhaps you can push intersection points.ML around a bit so as to remove the 2 N unwanted The surprise here is that the issue of removing intersection points in any dimension concerns only certain zero-, one-, and two-dimensional manifolds that live inside your 2 tion due to Hassler Whitney. In particular, Whitney dis-n-dimensional one. This is an old observa- \text{covered that in the} 2 n-dimensional manifold you must be able to find a disk of dimension two whose bound-ary loop lies half in$M^{L} \text{and half in} M^{R}$. This boundary loop must hit two of the intersection points (one whenit passes from M to M and one when it passes back again). The disk must also stick out orthogonally toand MR where it touches them. If its interior is disjoin(t L)R ML from both$M^{L} and M^{R}$, and if there are no points where

405

the disk comes back to intersect itself, then you canpush the part of M that is very near the disk along the L disk while stretching the remaining part to keep things from tearing. If you extend the disk a bit past$MR$, then you will have removed two of the intersection points when you have pushed past the end of the disk. Figure 12 is a schematic of this. This pushing operation(the Whitney trick) can be performed in any manifold of any dimension if you can find the required disk. The problem is to find the disk. Figure 13 is a drawing of across-sectional slice showing a “good” disk on the left and some badly chosen disks in the middle and on theright. If you have a badly chosen disk that nevertheless satisfies the required boundary conditions, thenyou might hope to find a tiny wiggle of its interior that makes it better. You would like the new disk to have noself-intersection points and you would like its interior to be disjoint from both direction that is parallel to the disk itself will help, for ML and MR. No wiggle along a any such wiggle only changes the position of the intersection point in the disk. Likewise, a wiggle in a direc-tion parallel to the offending ML or MR is useless since it only changes the position of the intersection pointin the latter space. Thus, 2$+ n \text{of the} 2n dimensions$ are useless when it comes to wiggling a disk. However, \text{there are} 2 n - (n + 2) = n - 2 \text{remaining dimensions to} work with, which is a positive number when 2 fact, when this is true a generic wiggle in any of these$n > 4$. In extra dimensions does the trick.Now, when 2 n = 4 (so n = 2) there are no extra dimensions, and, consequently, no small wiggle canmake a new disk without intersection points. So if a given candidate disk intersects$MR$, then the Whitney trick just trades the old pair of intersection points fora new collection. If the disk intersects either itself or Mpoints: that is, points where one part has come around L, then the new version of$M^{L} \text{has self} - intersection$ to intersect another.This failure of the Whitney trick is the bane of four-dimensional topology. Thus, a major lemma for Michael Freedman’s classification theorem about topological four-dimensional manifolds describes ubiquitous circumstances where a topologically (but not smoothly!) embedded disk can be found for use in the Whitney trick. 3 How Geometry Enters the Fray Much of our current understanding about smooth man-ifolds in dimensions 4 or less has come via what

might be called geometric techniques. The search for acanonical geometric structure on a given three-dimensional manifold is an example. Perelman’s proof of the geometrization theorem proceeds in this manner. The idea is to choose any convenient geometric structure on a given three-dimensional manifold and then con-tinuously deform it by some well-defined rule. If one views the deformation as a time-dependent process, then the goal is to design the deformation rule to makethe geometric structure ever more symmetric as time goes on. A rule introduced and much studied by Richard Hamilton and then used by Perelman specifies the time-derivative of the geometric structure at any given time in terms of certain of its properties at that time. It is a nonlinear version of the classical[I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). For those unfamiliar with the latter, the sim-heat equation plest version modifies functions on the real line and will now be described.

(Moduli spaces in topology are often algebraic geom-algebraic toreferred to asgive a geometric structure to the classifying spaces.) The basic idea is tototality of the objects we are trying to classify. If we can understand this geo-metric structure, then we obtain powerful insights into the geometry of the objects themselves. Further more, moduli spaces are rich geometric objects in their own right. They are “meaningful” spaces, in that any state-ment about their geometry has a “modular” interpretation, in terms of the original classification problem. As aresult, when one investigates them one can often reach much further than one can with other spaces. moduli spaces such as the moduli of elliptic curves [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) (which we discuss below) play a central role in a vari-ety of areas that have no immediate link to the geometry being classified, in particular in algebraic number theorythe study of moduli spaces has benefited tremendously[IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) and algebraic topology. Moreover, in recent years from interactions with physics (in par-ticular with string theory [IV.17 §2](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras)). These interactions have led to a variety of new questions and new techniques. 1 Warmup: The Moduli Spaceof Lines in the Plane Let us begin with a problem that looks rather simple, but that nevertheless illustrates many of the important ideas of moduli spaces.

problem is easily solved by assigning to each line essential parameter, or modulus, a quantity that we can L an calculate for each line and that will help us tell different lines apart. All we have to do is take standard Cartesian coordinatesθ(L) between the linex, y on the plane and measure the angle L and the x-axis, taken in coun- ter clockwise fashion. We find that the possible valuesofθ are those for which 0 ⩽ θ < π, and that for every suchofθ with theθ there is exactly one linex-axis. So as a set L, we have a complete that makes an angle solution to our classification problem: the set of lines L, known as the real projective line RP1, is in one-to-one correspondence with the half-open interval[0, π). classification problem. What does this entail? We haveHowever, we are seeking a geometric solution to the a natural notion of when two lines are near each other,which our solution should capture—in other words, the collection of lines has a natural topology [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces). So far, our solution does not reflect the fact that lines L for which the angle θ(L) is close to π are almost horizontal: they are therefore close to thewhichθ = 0) and to the lines L with θ(L) close to zero.x-axis (for We need to find some way of “wrapping around” the interval[0, π) so that π becomes close to 0. One way to do this is to take not the half-open interval“identify” the points 0 and[0, π) but the closed intervalπ. (This idea can easily be[0, π], and then to made formal by defining an appropriate relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar).) Ifπ and 0 are regarded as the equivalence same, then numbers close toclose to 0. This is a way of saying that if you attach theπ are close to numbers two ends of a line segment together, then, topologically speaking, you obtain a circle. gested by the following geometric construction of Consider the unit circle A more natural way of achieving the same end is sug- S1 ⊂ R2. To each point s \in RP(S1)1., there is an obvious way of assigning a line L(s): take the line that passes through have a family of lines parametrized bys and the origin. Thus, we S1, that is, a map (or function)in our set RP1 s. What is important about this is that we\to  L(s) that takes points in S1 to lines already know what it means for two points in S1 \text{to be} close to each other, and the map$s \to L(s) \text{is continu}-$ ous. However, this map is a two-to-one function rather than a bijection, sinces and -s always give the same line. To remedy this, we can identify eachcle S1 with its antipodal point -s. We then have a one-s in the cir- to-one correspondence between RP1 and the resulting quotient space [I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) (which again is topologically

a circle), and this correspondence is continuous in both directions. The key feature of the space RP1, considered as the moduli spacethe ways in which lines canof lines in the plane, is that it captures modulate, or vary continuously in families. But when do families of lines arise?A good example is provided by the following construction.

1.1 Other Families

The idea of families of lines leads to various other geo-metric structures on the space RP1, and not just its topological structure. For example, we have the notionof a differentiable family of lines in the plane, which is a family of lines for which the angles vary differen-tiably. (The same ideas apply if we replace “differentiable” by “measurable,” “$C \i\text{nf ty}$,” “real analytic,” etc.) To parametrize such a family appropriately, we would like RP1 to be a [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), \text{so that we can calculate derivatives of functions on it}. \text{Such astructure on} \text{differentiable} \text{manifold RP}1 \text{can be specified by using the angle functions function}θθ\text{gives us a coordinate for lines that are notand} φ\text{defined in the previous section}. \text{The too close to thex} - axis, and φ \text{gives us a coordinate for lines that are not too close to theculate derivatives of functions on RPy} - axis. \text{We can cal} - 1 \text{by writing them in terms of these coordinates}. \text{One can justify this dif}-\text{ferentiable structure on RP}1 \text{by checking that for any} 410 \text{differentiable} curve C ⊂ R2 \ 0 \text{the map} c \to L(c) \text{comes out as} \text{differentiable}. \text{This means that ifto thex} - axis, \text{then the function} x \to θ(L(x))L(c) \text{is not closeis} \text{differentiable} \text{at The functionsx} = xc\to , \text{and similarly for}θ(L(x)) and \to φ(L(x))φ \text{and theare calledy} - axis. pullbacks“\text{pulling back},”, \text{because they are the result of converting}, orθ and φ\text{from functions defined on RP}1 \text{to functions defined on We now can state the fundamental property of} C. RP1 as a differentiable space. A differentiable family of lines in R2 parametrized by a differentiable manifold tion from X \text{to RP}1, taking a point X is the same thing as a func-x to a line L(x), such that the pullbacksx \to  θ(L(x)) and x \to  φ(L(x)) of the functionsθ, φare differentiable functions. We say that RP1 (with its differentiable structure) is thelines inmoduli space R2. This means thatof (differentiably varying families of)RP1 carries the universal differentiable family of lineswe have assigned to each point of. From the very definition, RP1 a line in R2, and these lines vary differentiably as we vary the point. The above assertion says thatlines, parametrized by a spaceany differentiable family of X, is described by giv- ing a map f: X \to  RP1 and assigning to x \in  X the line L(f (x)).

1.2 Reformulation: Line Bundles

It is interesting to reformulate the notion of a (continu-ous or differentiable) family of lines as follows. Let X be a space and letpoints in X. For each pointx \to  L(x) be an assignment of lines tox \in  X, we place a copy of R^2$at$ X \times x; in other words, we consider the Cartesian product R2. We may now visualize the line L(x) as living in the copy of R2 that lies overx. This gives us a contin- uously varying collection of linesbyx \in  X, otherwise known as a line bundle L(x) parametrized over X. Moreover, this line bundle is embedded in the “trivial”vector bundle [IV.6 §5](/part-04/algebraic-topology)$X \times R^{2}$, which is the constant assignment that takes eachcase when$X$ \text{is RP}1 itself, we have a “tautological” line$x \text{to the plane} R^{2}$. In the bundle: to each point$s \in RP^{1}$, which we can think of as a line$L^{s} in R^{2}$, it assigns that very same line Ls. Proposition. For any topological space X there is a natural bijection between the following two sets: (i) the set of continuous functions$f$:$X \to RP^{1}$; and (ii)the trivial vector bundlethe set of line bundles on X X\times  that are contained in R2.

ing pullback of the tautological line bundle on This bijection sends a functionf \text{to the correspond} - RP1. That is, the functionx \to  L . (This is a pullback because it convertsf is mapped to the line bundle L from a function defined on$f$ (x) RP1 to a function defined on Thus, the space X.) RP1 carries the universal line bun- dle that sits in the triviala line bundle sitting in the trivial R2 bundle—any time we have R2 bundle, we can obtain it by pulling back the universal (tautological)example on RP1.

1.3 Invariants of Families

Associated with any continuous function circle S1 to itself is an integer known as itsf from thedegree. Roughly speaking, the degree oftimesf (x) goes around the circle whenf is the number ofx goes around once. (If it goes backwards degree is-n.) Another way to think of the degree is asn times, then we say that the the number of times a typical point in S1 is passed byf (x)as +1 if it is passed in the counter clockwise directionas x goes around the circle, where we count this$and$-1 if it is passed in the clockwise direction. Earlier, we showed that the circle$S^{1}$, which we obtained by identifying the endpoints of the closed interval[0, π], could be used to parametrize the mod- uli space RP1 of lines. Combining this with the notion of degree, we can draw some interesting conclusions.In particular, we can define the notion of winding numbersγ from the circle. Suppose that we are given a continuous function S1 into the plane R2 and suppose that it avoids 0. The image of this map will be a closed loop$C$(which may cross itself). This defines for us a map fromthen work out S1\text{to itself}: \text{first do} L(c), which belongs toγ to obtain a point RP1, and finallyc in C, use the parametrization of RP1 to associate with L(c) a point in S1 again. The degree of the resulting compos- ite map will behence C, winds around 0, so half this number is defined twice the number of times thatγ, and to be the winding number of More generally, given a family of lines inγ.

(We postpone the discussion of the final ingre-dient, the notion of families of Riemann surfaces, to section 2.2.) To do this, we must give a notion ofmorphism between Riemann surfaces: when should twoiso Riemann surfaces X and Ybe “identified,” or thought of as giving two equivalent realizations of the same underlying object of our classification? This issue was hidden in our toy example of classifying lines in theplane: there we simply identified two lines if and only if they were equal as lines in the plane. This naive option is not available to us with the more abstractly defined Riemann surfaces. If we considered Riemann surfaces realized concretely as subsets of some larger space—for example, as solution sets to algebraic equations in complex projective space—we could similarly choose to identify surfaces only if they were equal assubsets. However, this is too fine a classification for most applications: what we care about is the geometry of Riemann surfaces, and not incidental fea-intrinsic tures that result from the particular way we choose to realize them.At the other extreme, we might choose to ignore the extra geometric structure that makes a surface into a Riemann surface. That is, we could identify two Riemann surfaces X and Y if they are topologically equiva- lent, or homeomorphic (the “coffee mug is a doughnut”perspective). The classification of compact Riemann surfaces up to topological equivalence is captured by asingle positive integer, the genus$g$(“number of holes”) of the surface. Any surface of genus zero is homeomor-phic to the Riemann sphere CP1$≃ S^{2}$, any surface of genus 1 is homeomorphic to a torus$S1 \times S1$, and so on. Thus, in this case there is no issue of “modulation”—the classification is solved by giving a list of possible values of a single discrete invariant. as Riemann surfaces manifolds, then this classification is too crude: it com-However, if we are interested in Riemann surfaces rather than simply as topological pletely ignores the complex structure. We would nowlike to refine our classification to remedy this defect. To this end, we say that two Riemann surfaces(conformally, or holomorphically) equivalent X andif there is Y are

412

a topological equivalence between them that preserves the geometry, i.e., a homeomorphism that preserves the angles between curves, or takes holomorphic functionsto holomorphic functions, or takes rational functions to rational functions. (These conditions are all equiv-alent.) Note that we still have at our disposal our discrete invariant—the genus of a surface. However, as weshall see, this invariant is not fine enough to distinguish between all in equivalent Riemann surfaces. In fact, it ispossible to have families of in equivalent Riemann surfaces that are parametrized by(but we cannot make proper sense of this idea until we continuous parameters have said precisely what is meant by a family of Rie-mann surfaces). Thus, the next step is to fix our discrete invariant and to try to classify all the different isomor-phism classes of Riemann surfaces with the same genus by assembling them in a natural geometric fashion. uniformization theorem simply connected Riemann surface is holomorphically An important step toward this classification is the[V.34](/part-05/the-uniformization-theorem). This states that any isomorphic to one of the following three: the Rie-mann sphere CP1, the complex plane C, or the upper half-plane H (equivalently, the unit disk D). Since the universal covering space surface is a simply connected Riemann surface, the[III.93](/part-03/universal-covers) of any Riemann uniformization theorem provides an approach to clas-sifying arbitrary Riemann surfaces. For instance, any compact ply connected, and in fact homeomorphic to the Rie-[III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) Riemann surface of genus zero is simmann sphere, so the uniformization theorem already solves our classification problem in genus zero: up to equivalence, CP1 is the only Riemann surface of genus zero, and so in this case the topological and conformal classifications agree.

2.1 Moduli of Elliptic Curves

Next, we consider Riemann surfaces whose universal cover is C, which is the same as saying that they are quotients ofof C by Z, which means that we regard two complex C. For example, we can look at a quotient numbers This has the effect of “wrappingz and w as equivalent if Caround” into a cylin-z - w is an integer. der. Cylinders are not compact, but to get a compact surface we could take a quotient by Z2 instead: that is, we could regard ference is of the formz anda +wbi, whereas equivalent if their dif-a and b are both integers. Now C is wrapped around in two directions and the result is a torus with a complex (or, equiva-lently, conformal or algebraic) structure. This is a compact Riemann surface of genus 1. More generally, we

Thus, if someone hands us another genus-1 surface E^ , there may be no way to identify E with E^ , or there may be infinitely many ways: we can always compose a given isomorphism between them with a self-symmetry of E. As we will discuss later, automorphisms haunt almost every moduli problem, and are crucial when we consider the behavior of families. It is usually convenient to “rigidify” the situation somewhat, so that the pos-sible isomorphisms between different objects are less “floppy” and more uniquely determined. In the case of elliptic curves, distinguishing the pointby reducing the symmetry of E. Once we do that, theree achieves this is usually at most one way to identify two elliptic curves (one way, that is, that takes origin to origin). choice of a marked point) can be described by concrete“linear algebra data”: a lattice We see that Riemann surfaces of genus 1 (with the L ⊂ C, or rather the equiv- alence class consisting of all nonzero scalar multiples\lambda L of L. This is the ideal setting to study a classification, or moduli, problem. The next step is to find an explicit parametrization of the collection of all lattices, up to multiplication, and to decide in what sense we have obtained a geometric solution to the classification problem. follow a procedure used for all moduli problems: first parametrize lattices together with the choice of some In order to parametrize the collection of lattices, we additional structure, and then see what happens when we forget this choice. For every lattice basisω, ω \in L: that is, we represent L we choose a L as the set of all integer combinations1 2 aω1 + bω2. We do this in an parallelogram oriented fashion: we require that the spanned byω and ω is positively ori-fundamental ented.

(Note that the hexagonal lattice is also repre-sented by the point$ω = (e^{2}()^{π})^{{}i}^{/}^{3}$.) The square lattice, which corresponds to the elliptic curve formed by gluing the opposite sides of a square, has as its symmetries the group Z/4 Z of rotational symmetries of the square. The hexagonal lattice, which corresponds to the ellip-tic curve formed by gluing the opposite sides of a regular hexagon, has as its symmetries the group Z$/6Z of$ rotational symmetries of a hexagon.We see that the number of automorphisms of an elliptic curve jumps discontinuously at the special points$ω = \text{i and} ω = (e^{2}()^{π})^{{}i}^{/}^{6}$. This already suggests that some- thing might be wrong with M1$,1 \text{as a moduli space}$. Note that we avoided this problem with the moduli T of marked elliptic curves, since there are no auto- morphisms of an elliptic curve that also preserve the marking. Another place we might have observed this1$,^{1}$ problem with H$/ PSL (Z)$. We avoided the automorphism M1^,1 is when we passed to the quotientλ = −1 by quotienting by PSLthe two special points i and e2 2(Z) rather than SL2^πi^/6 are preserved by2(Z).

(To instance of the same phenomenon. If for every complex numberz you identify z with -z, then the result is to wrap the complex plane around into a cone with a sin-gularity at 0. The reason 0 is singled out is that it is preserved by the transform at io nz → −z. Here the angle would beto-one away from the singularity andπbecause the identification of points is two-π is half of 2π.) It is possible to massage these singularities away usingthe$j$-function, but they are indicating a basic difficulty. So why do automorphisms form an obstacle to the existence of “good” moduli spaces? We can demon-strate the difficulty by considering an interesting con-

tinuous family of marked elliptic curves parametrized by the circle S = S1. Let E(i)be the “square” elliptic curve that we considered earlier, based on the lattice of integer combinations of 1 and i. Next, for every between 0 and 1, let Et be a copy of E(i). Thus, we havet taken the constant, or “trivial,” family of elliptic curves over the closed unit interval[0, 1], \text{where every curve in} the family is E(i). Now we identify the elliptic curves at the two ends of this family, not in the obvious way, butby using the automorphism given by a 90◦ rotation, or multiplication by i. This means that we are looking atthe family of elliptic curves over the circle where each member of the family is a copy of the elliptic curvebut these copies twist by 90◦ as we go around the circle.E(i), family of elliptic curves by means of a map fromthe space It is easy to see that there is no way to capture this M . Since all of the members of the family$S^{1} to$ are isomorphic, each point of the circle should map tothe same point in1,1 M (the equivalence class of i in Hthe). \text{But the constant map trivial family} S1 \times 1(E,)1 \text{of elliptic curves over} S1 → {i} \in (M1(),){1}classifies S1, thati

Thus, there E(i) but are more families of elliptic curves than there are mapsto M ; the quotient space H$/ PSL (Z) \text{cannot handle}$ the complications caused by automorphisms. A variantof this construction applies to complex-analytic fami-1,1 2 lies with S1 replaced by C\times . This is a very general phe- nomenon in moduli problems: whenever objects have nontrivial automorphisms, we can imitate the construction above to get nontrivial families over an interesting parameter set, all of whose members are the same. As a result, they cannot be classified by a map to the set of all isomorphism classes.What do we do about this problem? One approach is to resign ourselves to having coarse moduli spaces, which have the right points and right geometry but do not quite classify arbitrary families. Another approachis the one that leads to$T$: we can fix markings of one kind or another, which “kill” all automorphisms.In other words, we choose enough extra structure on1,1 our objects so that there do not remain any (nontriv-ial) automorphisms that preserve all this decoration. In fact, one can be far more economical than pickinga basis of the lattice$L$and obtaining the infinite coveringto some congruence (for example, of$T1^{\}\\{}}$,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}1 of M1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}1: one can fix a basis of$L/2L)$.

For eachwould like to define a space M , called the modulig we space of curves of genusmann surfaces of genus gg, that classifies compact Rie-and tells us how they modu-$g$ late. Thus, the points of Mg should correspond to our objects, compact Riemann surfaces of genusbe more accurate, equivalence classes of such surfaces, g, or, to where two surfaces are considered to be equivalent if there is a complex-analytic isomorphism between them. In addition, we would likeit can to embody the structure of continuous fami-Mg to do the best lies of genus-M parametrizing “g surfaces. Likewise, there are spacesn-punctured” Riemann surfaces of genus surfaces, but Riemann surfaces together with a “deco-g, n g. This means we consider not “bare” Riemann ration” or “marking” byn distinct labeled points (punc- tures). Two of these are considered to be equivalent ifthere is a complex-analytic isomorphism between them that takes punctures to punctures and preserves labels. Since there are Riemann surfaces with automorphisms, we do not expect M to be able to classify all families of Riemann surfaces: that is, we will expect examples similar to the twisted square-lattice construction dis-$g$ cussed earlier. However, if we consider Riemann sur-faces with enough extra markings, then we will be able to obtain a moduli space in the strongest sense. Oneway to choose such markings is to consider M with nto mark generators of the fundamental group, leading large enough (for fixedg). \text{Another approach will be}g, n to the Teichmüller spaces Tg and Tg, n.

3.1 Digression: “Abstract Nonsense”

It is interesting to note that, while we have yet tosee why such a space exists, it follows from general, nongeometric principles—“abstract nonsense”—that it is completely and uniquely category theory [III.8](/part-03/categories) or determined, both as a topological space and as a com-plex manifold, by this characteristic property. In a very abstract way, every topological space M can be uniquely reconstructed from its set of points, the set of paths between these points, the set of surfaces spanning these paths, and so on. To put it differently, we can choice of a basepoint, choosing a path from1. Note that while the fundamental group of$xπto^{1}(X$, x)y, and the different choices are related byandπ1(X, y)may be identified by X depends on the conjugation by a loop. Thus, if we are willing to identify sets of gener-ators$A^{i}$, Biwhen they differ only by a conjugation, then we can ignore the choice of a basepoint.

It turns out that there isn \times  n matrices (the image no moduli space for this problem, even in the coarse sense, unless we consider only “nice enough” matrices: for example, matrices that consist of only a single Jordan block. This is a good example of a ubiquitous phenomenon in moduli problems: one is often forced to throw out some “bad” (unstable) objects in order tohave any chance of obtaining a moduli space. (See the paper by Mumford and Suominen (1972) for a detailed discussion.)

In particular, the moduli spaces of higher-genus surfaces are not described purely by linear algebra plus data about orientation, as is the case in genus 1. that the fundamental group Part of the blame for this complexity lies with the factΓg ≃ π1(X) (g > 1) \text{is no}longer Abelian, and in particular it is no longer equal tothe first homology group H(X, Z). A related problem is that X is no longer a group. A beautiful solution to this1 problem is given by the construction of the Jacobian Jac(X), which shares with elliptic curves the properties of being a torus (homeomorphic to$(S^{1}()^{2})^{g})$, an Abelian group, and a complex (in fact complex-algebraic) man-ifold. (The Jacobian of an elliptic curve is the elliptic curve itself.) The Jacobian captures the “Abelian” or“linear” aspects of the geometry of X. There is a mod- uli space Ag for such complex-algebraic tori (known as Abelian varieties er ties and linear algebraic description of the moduli of), which does share all of the nice pr op elliptic curves theorem—is that by assigning to each Riemann surface M1,1 = A1. The good news—the Torelli Xanalytic subset ofits Jacobian we embed A . The interesting Mg as a closed, complex-news—the Schottky problem—is that the image is quite complicated$g$ to characterize intrinsically. In fact, solutions to this problem have come from as far afield as the study of nonlinear partial differential equations!

3.4 Further Directions

In this section we give hints at some interesting questions about, and applications of, moduli spaces. Deformations and degenerations.topics in moduli spaces ask which objects are very near Two of the main to a given one, and what lies very far away. Deforma-tion theory is the calculus of moduli spaces: it describes their infinitesimal structure. In other words, given an object, deformation theory is concerned with describ-ing all its small perturbations (see Mazur (2004) for a beautiful discussion of this). At the other extreme, wecan ask what happens when our objects degenerate? Most moduli spaces, for example the moduli of curves, are not compact, so there are families “going off toinfinity.” It is important to find “meaningful” compactificatio ns of moduli spaces, which classify the possi-ble degenerations of our objects. Another advantage of

compactifying moduli spaces is that we can then calcu-late integrals over the completed space. This is crucial for the next item. Invariants from moduli spaces.cation of moduli spaces in geometry and topology is An important a pp li inspired by quantum field theory, where a particle, rather than following the “best” classical path between two points, follows all paths with varying probabilities(see mirror symmetry [IV.16 §2.2.4](/part-04/mirror-symmetry)). Classically, one calculates many topological invariants by picking a geo-metric structure (such as a metric) on a space, calculating some quantity using this structure, and finally prov-ing that the result of the calculation did not depend on the structure we chose. The new alternative is to lookat all such geometric structures, and integrate some quantity over the space of all choices. The result, ifwe can show convergence, will manifestly not depend on any choices. String theory has given rise to many important applications of this idea, in particular by giving a rich structure to the collection of integrals obtained in this way. Donaldson and Seiberg–witten theories use this philosophy to give topological invariants of four-manifolds. Gromov–Witten theory appliesit to the topology of symplectic manifolds [III.88](/part-03/symplectic-manifolds), and to counting problems in algebraic geometry, suchas, How many rational plane curves of degree 5 pass through fourteen points in general position? (Answer:87 304.) Modular forms.mathematics, the Langlands program, relates number One of the most profound ideas in theory to function theory (harmonic analysis) on very special moduli spaces, generalizing the moduli space of elliptic curves. These moduli spaces (Shimura vari-eties) are expressible as quotients of symmetric spaces (such asmodular forms H) by arithmetic groups (such as PSL[III.59](/part-03/modular-forms) and automorphic forms are2(Z)). special functions on these moduli spaces, describedby their interaction with the large symmetry groups of the spaces. This is an extremely exciting and activearea of mathematics, which counts among its recent triumphs the proof ofthe Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture (Wiles, Taylor–fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) and Wiles, Breuil–Conrad–Diamond–Taylor).

1 Introduction

It is a fundamental theme in mathematics that many objects, both mathematical and physical, have symmetries. The goal oferal, and representation theory in particular, is to study group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) theory in genthese symmetries. The difference between representa-tion theory and general group theory is that in representation theory one restricts one’s attention to symmetries ofto explain why this is sensible and how it influences ourvector spaces [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). I will attempt here study of groups, causing us to focus on groups with certain nice structures involving conjugacy classes. 2 Why Vector Spaces? The aim of representation theory is to understand how the externally internal as a collection of symmetries. In the other structure of a group controls the way it acts direction, it also studies what one can learn about a group’s internal structure by regarding it as a group of symmetries.

what we mean by “acts as a collection of symmetries.”The idea we are trying to capture is that if we are given We begin our discussion by making more precise a groupeach element G and an objectg of G some symmetry of X, then we can associate with X, which we callφ(g)of symmetries to work properly: that is,. For this to be sensible, we need the compositionφ(g)φ(h) (the result of applyingφ(h) and then φ(g)) should be the same symmetry asof X is a particular kind ofφ(gh). if permutation X is a set, then a symmetry[III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) of its elements. Let us denote by Aut mu tat i ons of X. Then an action(X)of Gthe group ofon Xis defined toall perbe a homomorphism from G to Aut(X). If we are given such a homomorphism, then we say that The image to have in mind is that$G$“does things” to G acts on X.Xand vividly by for getting about. This idea can often be expressed more convenientlyφin the notation: thus, instead of writingφ(g)(x)for the effect onx of the symmetry associated withas a permutation and writeggx, we simply think of. However, sometimes weg itself do need to talk aboutwish to compare two different actions ofφas well: for instance, we might G on X. Here is an example. Take as our object X a square in the plane, centered at the origin, and let its vertices be A, B, C, and D (see figure 1). A square has eight symmetries: four rotations by multiples of 90◦and four reflections. Letmetries; this group is often called G be the group consisting of these eight sym-D , or the dihedral group But it also acts on the set ofof order 8. By definition, vertices G \text{acts on the square}.8\text{of the square}: for instance, the action of the reflection through they-axis is to switch A with B and C with D. It might seem as though we have done very little here. After all, we defined much effort to associate a symmetry with each element G as a group of symmetries so it does not take oftations of the set$G$. However, we did not define$\\{A}$, B, C, D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, so we have at least done G as a group of permu- something. sets on whichwe can build sufficiently naturally from the square.To make this point clearer, let us look at some other G acts, which will include any set that For instance,$\\{A}$, B, C, D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, but on the set of edges G acts not only on the set of vertices{AB, BC, CD, DA} and on the set of cross-diagonals\\\\\\\\\\\. . \1, BD\\\\\\\\\\\\} \text{as well}. \text{Notice in the latter case that some of the elements of Gact in the same way}: \text{for example}, \text{a clockwise rotation through} 90 \text{does a counter clockwise rotation through} 90◦ \text{interchanges the two diagonals}, as◦. \text{If all the elements offaithful}.\text{Gact differently}, \text{then the action is called IV}. \text{Branches of Mathematics} A B D C Figure 1 A \text{square and its diagonals}. \text{through thecan be applied to the whole Cartesian plane Notice that the operations on the square} (“reflecty - axis,” “\text{rotate through} 90◦,” \text{and so on})R2.

Because of this, we say that When V1 is a vector space, we denote by GL2 G acts linearly on the vector spac(e1)2 (V ) the set R2. of invertible linear maps fromtor space Rn, this group is the familiar group GLV to V. If V is the vec-(R) of invertible when V = Cnnit is the group of invertible matrices with\times  nmatrices with real entries; similarly,$n$ complex entries. Definition.space V is a homomorphism from A representation of a group G to GLG(V )on a vector. a group as a collection of permutations, while a repre-sentation is the special case where these permutations In other words, a group action is a way of regarding are invertible linear maps. One sometimes sees repre-sentations referred to, for emphasis, as linear representations. In the representation ofdescribed above, the homomorphism from D8 on GRto GL2 that we(R) took the symmetry “clockwise rotation through 90 the matrix(0 1 )and the symmetry “reflection through$◦^{2}$” to the Given one representation of$y$-axis” to the matrix-1 0 (-0 11 0 )G. , \text{we can produce oth}- ers using natural constructions from linear algebra. For example, ifρ is the representation of G on R2 described above, then its morphism from determinant G to R* (the group of nonzero real[III.15](/part-03/determinants) det ρ is a homo- numbers under multiplication), since \det (ρ(gh)) = \det (ρ(g)ρ(h)) = \det (ρ(g))\det (ρ(h)),

IV.9. Representation Theory

by the multiplicative property of determinants. Thismakes detρ a one-dimensional representation, since each nonzero real number element “multiply byt” of GLt can be thought of as the(R). If ρ is the represen- tation ofthat rotations act as the identity and reflections act as D8 just discussed, then under det1 ρwe find multiplication by-1. The definition of “representation” is formally very similar to the definition of “action,” and indeed, since every linear automorphism of V is a permutation on the set of vectors inform a subset of the actions of V , the representations of G on V . But the set of G on V representations is in general a much more interesting object. We see here an instance of a general principle: if a set comes equipped with some extra structure (asa vector space comes with the ability to add elements together), then it is a mistake not to make use of that structure; and the more structure the better. In order to emphasize this point, and to place representations in a very favorable light, let us start by considering the general story of actions of groups on sets. Suppose, then, that X. For each x, the set of all elements of the form G is a group that acts on a setgx, asgto show that the orbits form a partition ofranges over G, is called the orbit of x. It is not hard X. Example.the set X of Let ordered pairs G be the dihedral groupof vertices of the square, of D8 acting on which there are sixteen. Then there are three orbits of G on X, namely \. . \1, BB, CC, DD\\}, {AB}, BA, BC, CB, CD, DC, DA, AD, and \. . \1, CA, BD, DB\\. one orbit. In other words, it is transitive if for everyx An action ofand y in XGyou can find an elementon X is called transitive if there is justg such thatgx = y. When an action is not transitive, we can con- sider the action of effectively breaks up the action into a collection of G on each orbit separately, which transitive actions on disjoint sets. So in order to studyall actions of Gon sets it suffices to study transitive actions; you can think of actions as “molecules” and transitive actions as the “atoms” into which they can be decomposed. We shall see that this idea of decomposing into objects that cannot be further decomposed is fundamental to representation theory. source of such actions comes from subgroups Given a subgroup What are the possible transitive actions? A rich H of G, a left coset of H is a set of H of G. the form{gh}: h \in H, which is commonly denoted byg Hleft cosets form a partition of. An elementary result in group theory is that the G (as do the right cosets, 421 \text{if you prefer them}). There is an obvious action ofthe set of left cosets of H, which we denote by G/HG: ifon gcoset^  is an element of(g^ g)H. G, then it sends the coset g H to the Given a transitive action ofx It turns out that every transitive action is of this form!\in  X and let H be the subgroup of G on a set XG, choose some consisting of all elements stabilizer ofxh.) Then one can check that the action ofsuch thatx hx = x. (This set is called the G on For example, the action of X is the same1 as that of D8 Gon the first orbit above ison the left cosets of Hx. isomorphic to the action on the left cosets of the two-element subgroup Hgenerated by a reflection of the square through its diagonal.

Ififnn is prime, then there are very few subgroups, whileis a power of 2 there are quite a few. So number theory is involved even if all we want to do is under-stand the subgroup structure of a group as simple as a cyclic group.With some relief we now turn our attention back to linear representations. We will see that, just as with actions on sets, one can decompose representations into “atomic” ones. But, by contrast with the case ofsets, these atomic representations (called “irreducible” representations, or sometimes simply “irreducibles”)turn out to exhibit quite beautiful regularities. The nice properties of representation theory come largely from the following fact. While elements of the symmetric group Sn can be multiplied together, ele- ments of GLas multiplied. (But beware: the sum of two elements of(V ), being matrices, can be added as well$GL$(V ) is not necessarily an element of GL(V ), because it may not be invertible. It is, however, an element of the endomorphism algebra End(V )$. When V = C^{n}$, End(V ) is just the familiar algebra of all$n \times n \text{matrices with}$ complex entries, both invertible and not.) sider the cyclic groupωTo see the difference it makes to be able to add, con-n = 1, we get a representation G = Z/n Z.

Thenpω is an element of End(V ), and one can check that it is actually aspace Vω of V . In fact, this subspace is an projection[III.50 §3.5](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) onto a sub-eigenspace [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions): it consists of all vectorsv such that ρ(1)v =ωvρ(r )v, which implies, since= ωr v.

not By the above remark, we can write irreducible, then there is a G-invariant subspace G = W ⊕ W^  with W.W^  also G-invariant. If either W or W^  has a further Gther, and so on. We have just seen this done for the-invariant subspace, then we can decompose it fur- cyclic group: in that case the irreducible representa-tions were the one-dimensional representationsχ . The irreducible representations are the basic build-ω ing blocks of arbitrary complex representations, justas the basic building blocks for actions on sets are the transitive actions. It raises the question of what the irre-ducible representations are, a question that has been answered for many important examples, but which is not yet solvable by any general procedure.To return to the difference between actions and representations, another important observation is that anyaction of a group Gon a finite set X can be linearized in the following sense. Iflook at the X [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis)has n elements, then we can L2(X) of all complex- valued functions defined ongiven by the “delta functions”hilbert space Xδ. \text{This has a natural basis}x, which send x to 1 and all other elements ofof G on X into an action of X to 0. Now we can turn the action G on the basis in an obvious way: we just define definition by linearity, since an arbitrary functiongδx to be δgx. We can extend thisf is a linear combination of the basis functionsus an action of G on L2(X), which can be defined by aδx. This gives simple formula: ifthe function defined byf is a function in(gf )(x) = Lf (g2(X)-1, thenx).

Thus, an action special matrix to every group element, namely a matrix with only 0 s and 1 s and precisely one 1 in each row and each column. (Such matrices are called matrices.) By contrast, a general representation assigns permutation an Now, even when arbitrary invertible matrix.X itself is a single orbit under the action of G, the above representation on L^2(X) can break up into pieces.

This array is called thetable of the group, and it contains all the important character information about representations of the group: it isour periodic table. The basic theorem of the subject is that this array is a square. Theorem (the character table is square).a finite group. Then the characters of the irreducible Let G be representations form an orthonormal basis of$K^{G}$.

is 1 whenχ = ψ and 0 otherwise. The fact that it is a basis implies in particular that there are exactlyas many irreducible representations as there are conjugacy classes inclasses of representations to G, and the map from isomorphism K that sends each ρ to its character is an injection. That is, an arbitrary rep-resentation is determined up to isomorphism by its$G$ character.The internal structure of a group G that controls how it can act on vector spaces is the structure of conju-gacy classes of elements of G. This is a much gentler structure than the set of all conjugacy classes ofgroups of G. For example, in the symmetric groupsub-S two permutations belong to the same conjugacy classif and only if they have the same cycle type. Therefore,$n$ in that group there is a bijection between conjugacy classes and partitions of$n$.5 count subgroups, conjugacy classes are much easier tohandle.

We do not have a general method for constructing them, a kind of “non-Abelian fourier transform.” This is the central problem of representation theory.Let us see how this problem can be solved for the group$D^{8}$. Over the course of this article, we have already encountered three irreducible representations of this group. The first is the “trivial” one-dimensional representation: the homomorphism takes every element of D to the identity. The second isρ:$D^{8} \to GL^{1} that$ the two-dimensional representation we wrote down inthe first section, \text{where each element of}8$D \text{acts on} R2$ in the obvious way. The determinant of this represen-tation is a one-dimensional representation that is8 not trivial: it sends the rotations to 1 and the reflections to-1. So we have constructed three rows of the character table above. There are five conjugacy classes inial, reflection through axis, reflection through diagonal,$D^{8} (triv-$ 90◦ rotation$, 180^{◦} rotation)$, so we know that there are just two more rows.The equality|G| = 8 = 22 + 1 + 1 + (\dim  V )2 +(are one dimensional.

The prototypical example is the space L2(S1) of square-integrable functions on the circle$S^{1}$. We can think of the circle as the unit circle in C, and thereby identify it with the group of rotations of the circle(since multiplication by eiθ rotates the circle by θ). This action linearizes to an action on$L^{2}(S^{1})$: if$f$ is a square- integrable function defined oncircle, then(w · f )(z)is defined to be S1 and wf (wbelongs to the-1 z). \text{That is}, w · f \text{does to wz what} f \text{does to} z. \text{space tions}: \text{the functions Classical Fourier analysis expands functions in the} L2(S1) \text{in terms of a basis of trigonometric func}-\text{zn for} n \in Z.

The SO(nn+-sphere is acted on by the group of rotations1). As usual, this can be converted into a rep- resentation of SO$(n + 1) \text{on the space} L^{2}(S^{n})$, which we would like to decompose into irreducible repre-sentations; equivalently, we would like to decompose L2(Sn) into a direct sum of minimal SO(n+1)-invariant subspaces. similar to the proof for finite groups.

If The general result that one can prove by this method G is a compact group that acts con- tinuously on a compact space permutationφ(g) of X is continuous, and also that X (in the sense that eachφ(g) varies continuously with g)$, then L^{2}(X) splits$ up into an orthogonal direct sum of finite-dimensional minimal ear iz ed action of$G$-invariant subspaces; equivalently, the lin-G on L2(X) splits up into an orthog- onal direct sum of irreducible representations, all of which are finite dimensional. The problem of finding a

Hilbert space basis of L2(X) then splits into two sub- problems: we must first determine the irreducible representations of X, and then determine how many times each of these G, a problem which is independent of irreducible representations occurs in When$G = S^{1}$(which we identified with SO$L^{2}(X)$. (2)) and X = S1 as well, we saw that these irreducible repre- sentations were one dimensional. Now let us look atthe action of the compact group SO$(3) on S^{2}$. It can be shown that the action of$G on L^{2}(S^{2}) \text{commutes with}$ the Laplacian, the differential operator\D\text{elta on} L2(S2) \text{defined by}Δ = ∂x∂2 2 + ∂y∂2 2 + ∂z∂2 2.

That is, g(Δf ) = Δ(gf ) for any g \in  G and any (sufficiently smooth) functionan eigenfunction for the Laplacian (which means thatf . In particular, if f isΔf = \lambda f for some λ \in  C), then for each g \in  SO(3) we have

\D\text{elta gf} = g\Delta f = g\lambda f = \lambda gf,

sogf is also an eigenfunction for Δ. Therefore, the space eigenvalue V\lambda of all eigenvectors for the Laplacian with\lambda is G-invariant. In fact, it turns out that ifducible representation. Further more, each irreducible V\lambda is nonzero then the action of G on V\lambda is an irre- representation of SOMore precisely, we have a Hilbert space direct sum,(3) arises exactly once in this way.L2(S2) =n-⩾ 0(V2)n(2 n +2 ),

(These eigenspaces are discussed further in spherical harmonics The nice feature that each irreducible representation[III.87](/part-03/spherical-harmonics).) appears at most once is rather special to the exam-ple$L^{2}(S^{n})$. (For an example where this does not hap- pen, recall that with the regular representation L2(G) \text{of a finite group occurs dim}ρ times in G each irreducible representation L2(G).) However, other featuresρ are more generic: for example, when a compact Liegroup acts differentiably on a space X, then the sum of all the G - \text{invariant subspaces of} L2(X) corresponding to a particular representation is always equal to the setof common eigenvectors of some family of commuting differential operators. (In the example above, there wasjust one operator, the Laplacian.)

Hypergeometric equations, Bessel equations, and many integrable systems arise in this way. the representation theory of compact groups and thatof finite groups. Given a compact group There is more to say about the similarities between G and an irreducible representation its trace (since it is finite dimensional) and therebyρ of G, we can again take define its characteron each conjugacy class. Finally, “the character table$χ^{ρ}$. Just as before, χρ is constant is square,” in the sense that the characters of the irre-ducible representations form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of all square-integrable functions that are conjugation invariant in this sense. (Now, though, the “square matrix” is infinite.) When$G = S^{1} \text{this is the}$ Fourier theorem$; whensection 2.$ Gis finite this is the theorem of 4 Noncompact Groups, Groups in Character i st i cp, and Lie Algebras The “character table is square” theorem focuses our attention on groups with nice conjugacy-class structure. What happens when we take such a group but relax the requirement that it be compact?A paradigmatic noncompact group is the real numbers R. Like$S^{1}$, R acts on itself in an obvious way (the real number$s \to s + t)$, so let us linearize that action in the usual wayt is associated with the translation and look for a decomposition of$L^{2}(R) into R - invariant$ subspaces.In this situation we have a continuous family of irreducible one-dimensional representations: for each real number\lambda we can define the functionχ by χ (x) =$e2$πi \lambda x . These functions are not square integrable, bu(tλ)\lambda despite this difficulty classical Fourier analysis tells usthat we can write an L2-function in terms of them. However, since the Fourier modes now vary in a con-tinuous family, we can no longer decompose a function as a sum: rather we must use an integral. First, we define the Fourier transform ˆf of f by the formulaf (λ)fˆ is then$= f (x)f (x)(e^{2})^{π}=^{i}^{λ}x df (λ)$ˆx. The desired decomposition of(e-2()π){i}\lambda x dλ. This, the Fourier inversion formulaof the functionsχ, tells us that. We can also think of it as some-f is a weighted integral thing like a decomposition of$\lambda L^{2}(R)$ as a “direct integral” (rather than direct sum) of the one-dimensional subspaces generated by the functions$χ^{λ}$. However,

we must treat this picture with due caution since the functionsχ \text{do not belong to} L2(R). This example indicates what we should expect in gen-\lambda eral.

Thus, for this class of examples, it gives us (conjecturally) the hoped-for “non Abelian Fourier transform.” 6 Coda: The Langlands Program And so we conclude by just hinting at statements.If G(k) is a reductive group, we want to describe an appropriate category of representations forleast the character table, which we may think of as a G(k), or at “semi simplification” of that category. jugacy classes in sent at i ons.

Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory inof elements LG(C).15 of However, these are not conjugacy classes LG(C), as before, but of homomorphisms from the Galois group ofk to LG. \text{The Langlands dual} was originally defined in a combinatorial manner, butthere is now a conceptual definition. A few examples of pairs(SL , PGL(G,)$.^{L}G) are (GL^{n}$, GLn)$, (S(O^{2}()^{n})^{+1}$, S(p2)n), and resentation theory as built out of the structure ofthe arithmetic of In this way the Langlands program describes the rep-$n^{n} k$. G and the conjectures, it is not quite correct as stated. For instance, one has to modify the Galois group Although this description indicates the flavor of16 in such a way that the correspondence is true for the group GL$(k) = k^{*}$. When k = R, we get the representation theory ofanalysis; on the other hand, when1 R* (\text{or its compact form} S1 k), which is Fourieris a p-adic local field, the representation theory of$k^{*} \text{is described by}$ local class field theory. We already see an extraordinary aspect of the Langlands program: it precisely unifies and generalizes harmonic analysis and number theory.The most compelling versions of the Langlands program are “equivalences of derived categories” between the category of representations and certain geomet-ric objects on the spaces of Langlands parameters. These conjectural statements are the hoped-for fourier transforms. Though much progress has been made, a large part of the Langlands program remains to be proved. For finite reductive groups, slightly weaker statements have been proved, mostly by Lusztig. As all but twenty-six of thefinite simple groups arise from reductive groups, and as the sporadic groups have had their character tables computed individually, this work already determines the character tables of all the finite simple groups. For groups over R, the work of Harish-Chandra and later authors again confirms the conjectures. But for other fields, only fragmentary theorems have been proved. There is much still to be done.

The key to applications such as this is theidea that finitely generated groups can usefully be regarded as geometric objects in their own right. Thisidea has its origins in the work of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) (1878) and Dehn (1905) but its full force was recog-nized and promoted by Gromov, starting in the 1980 s. It is the key idea that underpins the later sections ofthis article.

Likewise, β2 = γ2 = 1.

The aim of the rest of this section is to say in more detail what this means. we can deduce others: for example, bearing in mind thatβ2 To begin with, notice that from the facts we are given= γ2 = (βγ)3 = 1, we can show that(γβ)3 = (γβ)3(βγ)3 = 1

as well (where the last equality follows after repeat-edly canceling pairs of the formββ or γγ). We wish to convey the idea that inbetween the generators except those that follow fromΓΔ \text{there are no relationships} the facts above by this kind of argument.Now let us try to say this more formally. We define a set of generators for a groupΓ to be a subset S ⊂ Γ such that every element ofelements of S and their inverses. That is, every elementΓ is equal to some product of can be written in the formis an element of S \text{and each}(s1)εε1 (sε)2 is 1 or2 · · · (sε)n-n, where each1. We then callsii

we certainly did not mean this at the end of the last paragraph: a relation is not the identity element ofΓ but rather a string of symbols such asa(b-1 a)-1 bc that yields the identity inas generators in the setΓ when you interpret S. In order to be clear abouta, b, and c this, it is useful to define another group, known as thefree group F(S). with three generators, taking our set A typical element is a “word” in the elements of For concreteness we shall describe the free group$S \text{to be} \\{a}$, b, c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. \1. and their inverses, such as the expression$a(b^{-1a})^{-1bc}$ considered in the previous paragraph. However, wesometimes regard two words as the same: for instance, abcc-1 ac and abab-1 bc are the same because they become identical when we cancel out the inverse pairs$cc^{-1} and b^{-1b}$. More formally, we define two such words to befree group are the equivalent equivalence classes and say that the elements of the[I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar). To multiply words together, we just concatenate them: for instance, the product ofab-1 and bcca is ab-1 bcca, which we can shorten to“empty word.” This is the free group on three genera-acca. The identity is the torsa, b, and c. It should be clear how to generalize it to an arbitrary setthe set S = \\{a, b, c S, though we shall continue to discuss\\}. onproperty A more abstract way of characterizing the free groupa, b, and: ifc Gis to say that it has the followingis any group and φ is any function from universal S = \\{a, b, c\\} to G, then there is a unique homomor- phismandc toΦ φ(c)from.

So the unique-ness is obvious. The rough reason that this definition really does give rise to a well-defined homomorphism is that the only equations that are true in F(S) are ones that are true in all groups: in order forΦ not to be a homomorphism, one would need a relation to hold in F(S) that did not hold in G, but this is impossible. to prove that it is (isomorphic to) the “freest” groupwith generators Now let us return to our exampleα, β, and γthat satisfies the relationsΓΔ. \text{We would like}α2 = β2 = γ2 = (αβ)6 = (αγ)6 = (βγ)3 = 1.

Thus, we are trying tobuild the “freest” group with generatorsa, b, and c that satisfies the relations(ac)6 = (bc)3 = 1, which we denote bya2 = b2 = c G2 == (ab)a, b, c6 =|a2, b2$, c2$, (ab)6$, (ac)6$, (bc)3. to imitate the above discussion of the free group itself, except that now we say that two words are equivalent There are two ways of going about this task. One is if you can get from one to the other by inserting ordeleting not just inverse pairs but also one of the words $a^{2}$, b2$, c2$, (ab)6$, (ac)6$, or (bc)3. \text{For example}, ab2 c is equivalent tothe set of equivalence classes of words with the productac in this group. Gis then defined to be coming from concatenation.A neater way to obtain G is more conceptual and ex- ploits the universal property of the free group. Asis to be generated bya, b, and c, the universal prop-G erty of the free group F(S) tells us that there will have to be a unique homomorphism such thatΦ(a) = a, Φ(b) = b, andΦΦ(c)from = F(S)c.

This gives us a very flexible way of constructing a wide variety of groups. We might, for example, use a group presentation to encode a question from elsewhere in mathematics. We could then askabout the properties of the group thus defined, and see what they had to tell us about our original problem. 3 Why Study Finitely Presented Groups? Groups arise through out the whole of mathematics as groups of automorphisms. These are maps from an object to itself that preserve all of the defining structure: two examples are the invertible ear maps [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from a vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) tolinitself, and the homeomorphisms from aspace [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) to itself. Groups encapsulate the essence topological of symmetry and for this reason demand our attention. We are driven to understand their general nature, identify groups that deserve particular attention, and develop techniques for constructing new groups (fromold ones, or from new ideas). And, \text{reversing the process of abstraction}, \text{when given a group}, \text{we want to find concrete instances of it}. \text{For example}, \text{we mightlike to realize it as the group of automorphisms of some interesting object}, \text{with the aim of illuminating the nature of both the object and the group}.

For example, he gavea simple formula for associating with a knot diagram [III.44](/part-03/knot-polynomials) a finite presentation of a group. There was one relation for each crossing in the diagram and he argued that the resulting group would be isomorphic to Z if and only if the knot was the unknot: that is, if and onlyif it could be continuously deformed into a circle. It is extremely hard to tell by staring at a knot diagram whether it is actually the unknot, so this seems like auseful reduction until one realizes that it can be just as hard to tell whether a finitely presented group is iso-morphic to Z. For example, here is the presentation of Z that Dehn’s recipe associates with one of smallest possible pictures of the unknot, namely a diagram withjust four crossings:

$a1$, a2, a3, a4, a5 |(a - 1)1 a3(a - 4)1$, a2(a - 3)1a1$, a3(a - 4)1(a - 2)1$, a4(a - 5)1a4(a - 3)1$. Thus Dehn’s investigations led him to understand how difficult it is to extract information from a group presentation. In particular, he was the first to identify the fundamental role of the word problem, which we

436

alluded to earlier, and he was one of the first to begin to understand that there are fundamental problems associated with the challenge of developing algorithms that extract knowledge from well-defined objects such asgroup presentations. In his famous article of 1912 Dehn writes: The general discontinuous group is given byators andmrelations between them. ...

I have chosen to focus on amalgamated free products and HNN extensions partly There are many ways of combining groups that I because they lead to transparent solutions of the basic problems discussed below but more because of their primitive appeal and the way in which they arise naturally in the calculation of fundamental groups. Theyalso mark the beginning of arboreal group theory, which we will discuss later. If space allowed, I would goon to describe semidirect and wreath products, which are also indispensable tools of the group theorist.Before turning to some applications of HNN extensions and amalgamated free products, I want to returnto the Burnside problem, which asks if there exist finitely generated infinite groups all of whose ele-ments have a given finite order. This question generated important developments through out the twenti-eth century, particularly in Russia. It is appropriate to mention it here because it provides another illustration of the fact that it can be useful to study a universal object in order to solve a general question.

Given an exponentby considering themfree Burnside group, one clarifies the problem at hand Bn, m given by the presentation of allmth powers in the free groupa1, . . . , an | Rm$, where F(a1$, . . . , a Rm consistsn). It is clear that generators in which every element has order dividing$B^{n}$, m maps onto any group with at most nmgroup with all elements of the same finite order if and. Therefore, there exists a finitely generated infinite only if, for suitable values ofn and m, the group B is infinite. Thus, a question that takes the form, Doesthere exist a group such that ...?, becomes a questionn, m about just one group. nite whenthe exact range of values for which Novikov and Adian showed in 1968 thatn ⩾ 2 and m ⩾ 667 is odd.

5.4 An Answer to Hopf’s Question

A group G is called Hopfian if every surjective homomorphism from familiar groups have this property: for example, finite G to G is an isomorphism. Most groups obviously do, as do Zn (as you can prove using linear algebra) and free groups. So too do groups ofmatrices such as SL(Z), as we shall discuss in a moment. A simple example of a non-Hopfian group isthe group consisting of all infinite sequences of inte-$n$ gers (under pointwise addition), \text{since the function thattakes}(a , a , a , . . . ) to (a , a , a , . . . ) \text{is a surjective homomorphism that contains But is there a finitely presented example}? \text{The answer}1 2 3 2(31, 04, 0, . . . ) \text{in its kernel}. is yes, and Higman was the first to construct one. the following examples are due to Baumslag and Solitar. Letp ⩾ 2 be an integer and identify Z with the free group subgroupsa generated by a single generatorp Z and (p + 1)Z of Zare identified with thea.

(If you want to convince yourself how useful this lemma is, set$p = 3 \text{and try to}$ prove directly thatgroup Bjust defined.)c is not equal to the identity in the

5.5 A Group That Has No Faithful

Linear Representation

One can show that a finitely generated group G of matrices over any field isthat for each nontrivial element residually finiteg \in G , \text{which means there exists a} finite group Q and a homomorphism π: G \to  Q withπ(g)g \in  SL≠(Z1. For example, if you are given an element), then you can pick an integer m bigger than the absolute values of all the entries inn \times  nnmatrix) and consider the homomorphism fromg (which is an SLmodn(Zm). The image ofto SLn(Z/m Z)gthat reduces the matrix entriesin the finite group SL(Z/m Z)n

is clearly nontrivial.

Non-Hopfian groups are not residually finite, and hence are not isomorphic to a group of matrices overany field. One can see that the non-Hopfian group Bdefined above is not residually finite by considering what happens to the nontrivial elementc. We saw that there was a surjective homomorphismψ(c) = 1. Let c be an element such thatψ:ψBn \to (c B)with = c (which exists sincen ψ is a surjection). \text{If there were}n \text{a homomorphism}π(c) =1, then we would have infinitely many distinctπ from Bto a finite group Q with homomorphisms fromtionsπ ◦ψn; these are distinct because B to Q$, \text{namely the composi}-π ◦ψm(c ) = 1$ if$m > n and π ◦ ψn(cn) = π(c) = 1$. \text{This is a con}-n tradiction, since a homomorphism from a finitely gen-erated group to a finite group is determined by what it does to the generators, so there can only be finitely many such homomorphisms.

5.6 Infinite Simple Groups

Britton’s lemma actually tells us more than thatc ≠$1$: \text{the subgroup}Λ of B generated by t and c is in fact a free group on those generators. Thus we may formthe amalgamated free productΓ of two copies of B, denotedofΛ \text{with the isomorphism} B1 and B2, by gluing together the two copiesc \to  t , t \to  c . We have 1 2 1 2

Thus1 2 2Γ1 is an infinite group with no finite quotients. It follows that the quotient ofmaximal proper normal subgroup is also infinite (andΓ by any it is simple by maximality).\text{The simple group that we have constructed is infinite and finitely generated but it is not finitely presentable}.\text{Finitely presented infinite simple groups do exist}, \text{but they are much harder to construct}. 6 Higman’s \text{Theorem and} \text{Undecidability} \text{We have seen that there are uncountably many} (non - isomorphic) \text{finitely generated groups}. \text{But as there are only countably many finitely only countably many finitely generated groups can bepresented groups}, \text{subgroups of finitely presented groups}. \text{Which onesare they}? \text{a beautiful and deep theorem proved by Graham Hig}-\text{man in} 1961, \text{which says}, roughly, \text{that the groups that} A \text{complete answer to this question is provided by arise are all those that are} \text{algorithmically} describable.(\text{If you have no idea what this means}, \text{even roughly}, \text{then you might like to read halting problem} [V.20](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - halting - problem) \text{before continuing with thisthe insolubility of the section}.)A \text{set Sof words over a finite alphabet} A \text{is called recursively enumerable more formally}, \text{Turing machine}) \text{that can produce aif there is some algorithm} (\text{or complete list of the elements oflar interest is when} A \text{is just a singleton}, \text{in which case} S.

Higman’s theorem tells us that Q can be embedded in a finitely presented group, but no truly explicit embedding is known. ease with which it implies the celebrated undecidabil-ity results that were rightly regarded as watersheds The power of Higman’s theorem is illustrated by the of twentieth-century mathematics. In order to make this case convincingly, I shall give a complete proof(except that I shall assume some of the facts mentioned earlier) that there exist finitely presented groups with unsolvable word problems, and also that there are sequences of finitely presented groups among which one cannot decide isomorphism. We shall also see howthese group-theoretic results can be used to translate undecidability phenomena into topology.The basic seed of undecidability comes from the fact that there are recursively enumerable subsets S ⊂ N that are not recursive. Using this fact one can readily construct finitely generated groups with an unsolv-able word problem: given such a set of integers S we consider $J = a$, b, t | t(bnab-n)t-1 = bnab-n ∀n \in S . This is the HNN extension of the free group associated with the identity map L \to  L, where LF(a, b)is the subgroup generated by${bnab^{-}n}$:$n \in S$. Britton’s lemma tells us that the word $wm = t(bmab^{-}m)t^{-}1(bma^{-}1b^{-}m) equals 1$\in  J if and only if m \in  S, and by definition there is no algorithm to decide ifm \in S, \text{so we cannot} decide which of the unsolvable word problem.wm are relations. Thus J has an That there exist finitely presented groups for which the word problem is unsolvable is a much deeper fact, but with Higman’s embedding theorem at hand the

proof becomes almost trivial: Higman tells us that Jcan be embedded in a finitely presented groupΓ , and it is a relatively straightforward exercise to showthat if one cannot decide which words in the generators ofnot decide for arbitrary words in the generators of J represent the identity, then one can-Γ either. Once one has a finitely presented group with an unsolvable word problem, it is easy to translate unde-cid ability into all manner of other problems. For example, suppose thatΓ = A | Ris a finitely presented group with an unsolvable word problem, where\\{a , . . . , a \\} and no a equals the identity in Γ . For each A =$word1$ w made out of the letters i(nn)i A and their inverses, define a groupΓw to have presentation A, s, t | R, t-1(sia s-i)t(siws-i)$, i = 1$, . . . , n .i

In particular, it contains a copy ofΓ , and hence has an unsolvable word problem, whichw means that it cannot be a free group. Thus, since thereis no algorithm to decide whether$w = 1 in Γ$, \text{one can}- not decide which of the groups which others.$Γ^{w} \text{are isomorphic to}$ algorithm to determine whether or not a given finitely A variant of this argument shows that there is no presented group is trivial.

His basic idea was to show that ifthere were an algorithm to determine which triangulated 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, then one could use it to determine which finitely presented groups are trivial, which we know is impossible. In order to implement this idea one has to be careful to arrange that the4-manifolds associated with different presentations of the trivial group are homeomorphic: this is the delicate part of the argument. which compact three-dimensional manifolds are iso-Strikingly, there does exist an algorithm to decide morphic. This is an extremely deep theorem that reliesin particular on Perelman’s solution to thurston’s geometrization conjecture [IV.7 §2.4](/part-04/dierential-topology).

This geometry. difficult implication of the theorem, promised earlier, that a group can be finitely presented if and only if The constructions of K(P ) and M establish the more it is the fundamental group of a compact cell com-plex and of a compact 4-manifold. This result raises several natural questions. First, are there better, more informative, topological models for an arbitrary finitely presented groupsay about the classes of groups defined by the natu-Γ? And if not, then what can one ral constraints that arise when one tries to improve the model? For example, we would like to construct a lower-dimensional manifold with fundamental groupΓ , enabling us to exploit our physical insight into three- dimensional geometry. But it turns out that the fun-damental groups of compact three-dimensional manifolds are very special; this observation lies near the heart of a great deal of mathematics at the end ofthe twentieth century. Other interesting fields open up

when one asks which groups arise as the fundamen-tal groups of compact spaces satisfying curvature [III.13](/part-03/curvature) conditions, or constraints coming from complex geometry.A particularly rich set of constraints comes from the following question. Can one arrange for an arbitrary finitely presented group to be the fundamental group of a compact space (a complex or manifold, perhaps) whose universal cover isis a natural question from the point of view of topology contractible [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology)? This because a space with a contractible universal cover is, up to homotopy [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology), completely determined by its fundamental group. If the fundamental group isΓ , then such a space is called aits homotopy-invariant properties provide a rich array classifying space forΓ and of invariants for the group gross dependence that K(P ) Γhas on(getting away from the P rather than Γ ). If our earlier discussion of how hard it is to recognize Γdependence can actually be removed, then your skep-from P has left you very skeptical about whether this ticism is well-founded: there are many obstructions tothe construction of compact classifying spaces for an arbitrary finitely presented group; the study of them (under the generic namearea at the interface of modern group theory, topology, finiteness conditions) is a rich and homological algebra.One aspect of this area is the search for natural conditions that ensure the existence of compact classifying spaces (not necessarily manifolds). This is oneof several places where manifestations of nonpositive curvature play a fundamental role in modern group theory. More combinatorial conditions also arise. For example, Lyndon proved that for any presentation A | rwhere the single defining relationr \in  F(A)P ≡is not a nontrivial power, the universal cover of contractible.K(P ) is cerns questions of uniqueness and rigidity for classi-A neighboring and highly active area of research confying spaces. (Here, as is common, the wordis used to describe a situation in which requiring two rigidity objects to be equivalent in an apparently weak sense forces them to be equivalent in an apparently stronger sense.) For example, the (open) Borel conjecture asserts that if two compact manifolds have isomorphic funda-mental groups and contractible universal covers, then those manifolds must be homeomorphic.I have been talking mostly about realizing groups as fundamental groups, which led to certain free actions. That is, we could interpret the elements of the groupas symmetries of a topological space and none of these

IV. Branches of Mathematics

symmetries had any fixed points. Before moving on togeometric group theory I should point out that there are many situations in which the most illuminating actions of a group are not free: one instead allows wellunderstood stabilizers. (Theset of all symmetries in the group that leave that point stabilizer of a point is the fixed.) For example, the natural way in which to studyΓΔ is by its action on the triangulated plane, each vertex of which is left unmoved by twelve symmetries.A deeper illustration of the merits of seeking insight into algebraic structure through nonfree actions onsuitable topological spaces comes from the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees, which subsumes the theory of amalgamated free products and HNN exten-sions, whose potency we saw earlier. (This theory and its extensions often go under the heading ofgroup theory.) arboreal A tree is a connected graph that has no circuits in it. It is helpful to regard it as awhich each edge has length 1. The group actions that metric space [III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces) in one allows on trees are those that take edges to edges isometrically, never flipping an edge. If a groupΓ acts on a set X (in other words, if it can be regarded as a group of symmetries oforbit of a pointx \in  X is the set of all its images X), then thegx withgfree product\in  Γ . A group A^*Γ can be expressed as an amalgamated B if and only if it acts on a tree in such a way that there are two orbits of vertices, one orbit of Cedges, and stabilizers stabilizers of adjacent vertices and intersect in A, B, C (where A and BCare the, which is the edge stabilizer). HNN extensions correspond toactions with one orbit of vertices and one orbit of edges. Thus, amalgamated free products and HNN extensions appear asof Bass–Serre theory. These objects allow one to recover graphs of groups, which are the basic objects groups acting on trees from the quotient data of theaction, i.e., the quotient space (which is a graph) and the pattern of edge and vertex stabilizers. and instructive proof that any finite subgroup ofis conjugate to a subgroup of either An early benefit of Bass–Serre theory is a transparent A or B: given any set(A*)C BVpointof vertices in a tree, there is a unique vertex or mid-x minimizing max\\{d(x, v) | v \in  V \\}; one applies this observation withxprovides a fixed point for the action of the subgroup; Van orbit of the finite subgroup; and any point stabilizer is conjugate to a subgroup ofeither A or B. Arboreal group theory goes much deeper than this first application suggests. It is the basis for a decompo-sition theory of finitely presented groups from which

IV.10. Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory it emerges, for example, that there is an essentially canonical maximal splitting of an arbitrary finitely presented group as a graph of groups with cyclic edge stabilizers. This provides a striking parallel with the decomposition theory of 3-manifolds, a parallel that extends far beyond a mere analogy and accounts for much of the deepest work in geometric group theoryin the past ten years. If you want to learn more about this, search the literature formay also want to search for complexes of groups JSJ decompositions, which. You provide the appropriate higher-dimensional analogue for graphs of groups. 8 Geometric Group Theory Let us refresh the image ofby thinking again about the presentation K(P )in our mind’s eye P ≡ a, b |aba-1 b-1 of Z. \text{The complex} K(P ), as we saw earlier, is a torus. Now the torus can be defined as the quotientof the Euclidean plane R2 by the action of the group Z2 (where the point(m, n) \in  Z^2 acts as the translation(x, y) \to  (x + m, y + n)): in fact, R2, with an appropriate square tiling, is the universal cover of the torus. Ifwe look at the orbit of the point 0 under this action, it forms a copy oflarge-scale geometry of Z2, and one can thereby see the Z2 laid out for us. We can make the idea of the “geometry of Z2” precise by decreeing that edges of the tiling have length 1 and defining thegraph distance between vertices to be the length of the shortest path of edges connecting them.As this example shows, the construction of K(P ) involves the two main (intertwined) strands of geomet-ric group theory. In the first and more classical strand, one studies actions of groups on metric and topologi-cal spaces in order to elucidate the structures of both the space and the group (as with the action of Z2 on the plane in our example, or the action of the fundamental group of K(P ) on its universal cover in general). The quality of the insights that one obtains varies accord-ing to whether the action has or does not have certain desirable properties. The action of Z2 on R2 consists of isometries on a space with a fine geometric structure, and the quotient (the torus) is compact. Such actions are in many ways ideal, but sometimes one accepts weaker admission criteria in order to obtain a more diverse class of groups, and sometimes one demands even more structure in order to narrow the focus and study groups and spaces of an exceptional, but for that reason interesting, character. with the second. In the second strand, one regards This first strand of geometric group theory mingles

finitely generated groups as geometric objects in theirown right equipped with word metrics, which are defined as follows. Given a finite generating set S for a groupeach elementΓ, one defines theγ \in  Γ by an edge to each element of the Cayley graph of Γ by joining formγs or γs-1 with s \in  S (which is the same as the graph formed by the edges of the universal coveringof K(P )). The distance d (γ , γ ) between γ and γ is then the length of the shortest path fromedges have length 1. Equivalently, it is the length of the(S1)2 γ1 1 to γ2 \text{if all}2 shortest word in the free group onγ-1γ in Γ . S that is equal to 1 The word metric and the Cayley graph depend on the2 choice of generating set but their large-scale geometry does not. In order to make this idea precise, we introduce the notion of alence relation that identifies spaces that are similar onquasi-isometry. This is an equivaa large scale. Ifquasi-isometry from X and XYtoare two metric spaces, then a Y is a function φ: X \to Ywith the following two properties. First, there are pos-itive constantsc, C, \text{and such that cd}(x, x^ ) - ⩽d(φ(x), φ(x^ )) ⩽ Cd(x, x^ ) +: this says thatφ dis- torts sufficiently large distances by at most a constant factor. Second, there is a constant C^  such that for everyy \in  Y there is some x \in  X for which d(φ(x), y) ⩽ C^: this says thatevery element ofφis a “quasi-surjection” in the sense that Y is close to the image of an element of Consider for example the two spaces$X$. R2 and Z2, where the metric ondefined earlier. In this case the map Z2 is given by the graph distanceφ$: R2$\to  Z^2 that takes(x, y) to ( x!, y !) (where  x! denotes the largest integer less than or equal tox) is easily seen to be a quasi-isometry: if the Euclidean distance two points(x, y) and (x^ , y^ ) is at least 10, say, thend between the graph distance between will certainly lie between 1$(d xand 2!$, y !d). \text{Notice how lit} - and ( x^ !, y^ !) tle we care about the local structure of the two spaces:2 the map continuous.φ is a quasi-isometry despite not even being from X It is not hard to check that ifthat “quasi-inverts”X to Y , then there is a quasi-isometryφ, in the sense that everyφ is a quasi-isometryψ fromx Yin to X is at most a bounded distance fromin Y is at most a bounded distance fromψφ(x)φψ(y)and every. Oncey one has established this, it is easy to see that quasi-isometry is an equivalence relation. Returning to Cayley graphs and word metrics, it turns out that if you take two different sets of generators forthe same group, then the resulting Cayley graphs will be

444

quasi-isometric. Thus, any property of a Cayley graphthat is invariant under quasi-isometry will be a property not just of the graph but of the group itself. When dealing with such invariants we are free to think ofas a space (since we do not care which Cayley graph weΓ itself form), and we can replace it by any metric space thatis quasi-isometric to it, such as the universal cover of a closed Riemannian manifold with fundamental groupΓ (whose existence we discussed earlier). Then the toolsof analysis can be brought to bear on it. many people and often called the provides a crucial link between the two main strands A fundamental fact, discovered independently by Milnor–Švarc lemma, of geometric group theory. Let us call a metric space X a length space if the distance between each pair of points is the infimum of the lengths of paths joining them. The Milnor–Švarc lemma states that if a groupΓ acts “properly discontinuously” as a set of isometries of a length spaceΓis finitely generated and quasi-isometric to X, and if the quotient is compact, then X (for any choice of word metric).We have seen an example of this already: Z2 is quasiisometric to the Euclidean plane. Less obviously, the same is true ofelementα of Γ Γto the point of^Δ. (Consider the map that takes each Z2 nearest α(0).) manifold is quasi-isometric to the universal cover of The fundamental group of a compact RiemannianΔ that manifold. Therefore, from the point of view ofquasi-isometry invariants, the study of such manifolds is equivalent to the study of arbitrary finitely presented groups. In a moment we will discuss some nontrivial consequences of this equivalence. But first let usreflect on the fact that, when finitely generated groups are considered as metric objects in the framework oflarge-scale geometry, they present us with a new challenge: we should quasi-isometry. classify finitely generated groups up to less serves as a beacon in modern geometric group theory, one that has guided us toward many beauti-This is an impossible task, of course, but never the ful theorems, particularly under the general heading ofrigidity.

Fortunately, there is a much-studied definition that makes this idea precise. Given any group G and any subgroup H of G, the commutator [G, H] is the subgroup generated by all elements of the form$ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$, where g belongs to G and h belongs to H. If G is Abelian, then [G, H] contains just the identity. If G is not Abelian, thentains other elements besides the identity, but it may be[G, G] \text{forms a group} G1 \text{that con}- thattwo-step nilpotent group. In general, a[G, G1] is trivial.

This is a quite extraordinary fact: the Gromov’s theorem states that a group has polyno polynomial-growth condition is easily seen to be inde-pendent of the choice of word metric and to be an invariant of quasi-isometry. Thus the seemingly rigid and purely algebraic condition of having a nilpotent subgroup of finite index is in fact a quasi-isometry invariant, and therefore a flabby, robust characteristic of the group. orems have been established for many other classesof groups, including lattices in semisimple Lie groups In the past fifteen years quasi-isometric rigidity theand the fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds(where the classification up to quasi-isometry involves more than algebraic equivalences), as well as various classes defined in terms of their graph of group decompositions. In order to prove theorems of this type, one

IV.10. Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory must identify nontrivial invariants of quasi-isometry that allow one to distinguish and relate various classes of spaces. In many cases such invariants come fromthe development of suitable analogues of the tools of algebraic topology, modified so that they behave wellwith respect to quasi-isometries rather than continuous maps. 9 The Geometry of the Word Problem It is time to explain the comments I made earlier about the geometry inherent in the basic decision problems of combinatorial group theory. I shall concentrate exclusively on the geometry of the word problem. mate connection between the highly geometric study Gromov’s filling theorem describes a startlingly intiof disks with minimal area in[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and the study of word problems, which riemannian geometry seems to belong more to algebra and logic. On the geometric side, the basic object of study is the isoperimetric function nian manifold M . Given any contractible closed path of Fill M (l) of a complete Rieman- lengthby that path. The largest such area, over all closed pathsl, there is a disk of minimal area that is bounded of length metric function is the smallest function of which it isl, is defined to be Fill M(l).

Correspondingly, Hn (\text{and quo}- tients of them by groups of isometries) are quadratic and linear, respectively. In a moment we shall discuss what types of isoperimetric functions arise when one considers other geometries (more precisely, compact Riemannian manifolds). To state the filling theorem we need to think about the algebraic side as well. Here, we identify a function that measures the complexity of a direct attack on the word problem for an arbitrary finitely presented groupΓ = A | R . If we wish to know whether a word w equals the identity ininsight into the nature ofΓ and do not have any furtherΓ , then there is not much we can do other than repeatedly insert or remove the given relations r\in R. 445 \text{In this group prove this}?

This contraction can be given a more topological character if we turn our Cayley graph into a two-dimensional complex by filling in each small loop with a face.

9.1 What Are the Dehn Functions?

We have seen that the complexity of word problems is related to the study of isoperimetric problems in Riemannian and combinatorial geometry.

(It With this picture in mind, one might move a little makes little sense to specify the thinness constantδ since it will change when one changes generating set.)The answer is Gromov’s hyperbolic groups. This is a fascinating class of groups that has many equivalent definitions and arises in many contexts. For example, we have already met it as the class of groups that have linear Dehn functions. (It is not at all obvious that these two definitions are equivalent.)Gromov’s great insight is that because the thin-triangles condition encapsulates so much of the essenceof the large-scale geometry of negatively curved manifolds, hyperbolic groups share many of the rich proper-ties enjoyed by the groups that act nicely by isometries on such spaces. Thus, for example, hyperbolic groups have only finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups, contain no copy of Z2, and (after accounting for torsion) have compact classifying spaces. Their conjugacy problems can be solved in less than quadratic time, and Sela showed that one can even solve the isomorphism problem among torsion-free hyperbolic groups. In addition to their many fascinating properties and natural definition, a further source of interest in hyperbolic groups is the fact that in a precise sta-tistical sense, a random finitely presented group will be hyperbolic.Spaces of negative and nonpositive curvature have played a central role in many branches of mathematics in the last twenty years. There is no room even tobegin to justify this assertion here but it does guide us in where to look for natural enlargements of the classof hyperbolic groups: we want nonpositively curved groups, defined by requiring that their Cayley graphs enjoy a key geometric feature that cocompact groupsof isometries inherit from simply connected spaces of nonpositive curvature (“CATtrast to the hyperbolic case, the class of groups that one(0)spaces”). But in con obtains varies considerably when one perturbs the definition, and delineating the resulting classes and their(rich) properties has been the subject of much research.

Remarkably, this vague question has a convinc-immediate neighbors of free ing answer.One of the great triumphs of arboreal group theory is the proof that there is a finite description of the set Hom finitely generated group(G, F) of homomorphisms from an arbitrary G to a free group F . The basic building blocks in this description are what Sela calls limit groups. One of the many ways of defining a limit group Lis that for each finite subset X ⊂ L there should exist a homomorphism to a finitely generated free group that is injective on X . first-order logic group in a precise sense. To see how first-order logic Limit groups can also be defined as those whose[IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory) resembles that of a free can be used to say something nontrivial about a group, consider the sentence

A group with this property isx commutes with y ≠ 1, and commutative transitivey commutes with z, then: if xhave this property but a direct product of non-abelian commutes with z. Free groups and Abelian groups free groups, for example, does not.It is a simple exercise to show that free Abelian groups are limit groups. But if one restricts attentionto groups that have precisely the same first-order logic as free groups, one gets a smaller class consisting onlyof hyperbolic groups. The groups in this class are the subject of intense scrutiny at the moment. They all have negatively curved two-dimensional classifying spaces, built from graphs and hyperbolic surfaces in a hierar-chical manner.

I have mentioned$g^{g}$ them here in order to make the point that, beyond thesearch for knowledge about natural classes of groups, there are certain “gems” in group theory that merit adeep and penetrating study in their own right.

But so it must be, for as Higman’s theorem assures us, the challenges, joys, and frustrations of finitely presented groups can never be exhausted.

1 Introduction

Much of analysis tends to revolve around the study of general classes of[III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties). The functions are often real-valued or complex-functions [I.2 §2.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar) and operators valued, but may take values in other sets, such as avector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or a manifold [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). An operator is itself a function, but at a “second level,”because its domain and range are themselves spaces of functions: that is, an operator takes a function (or per-haps more than one function) as its input and returns a transformed function as its output. Harmonic analysis

focuses in particular on thesuch functions, and how these quantitative properties quantitative properties of change when various operators are applied to them.1 are two important examples. First, a function is saidto be What is a “quantitative property” of a function? here uniformly bounded if there is some real number M such that |f (x)| ⩽ M for every x.

In such cases, how does one think about a function? The able harmonic analysisanalysis1. Strictly speaking, this sentence describes the field of, which is primarily concerned with how real- or complex-. There is another field called abstract harmonic real-varivalued functions (often on very general domains) can be studied using symmetries such as translations or rotations (for instance, via the Fourier transform and its relatives); this field is of course related toreal-variable harmonic analysis, but is perhaps closer in spirit to representation theory and functional analysis, and will not be discussed here.

answer is to focus on its deduced from them: even if the solution of a differen-properties and see what can be tial equation cannot be described by a useful formula, one may well be able to establish certain basic facts about it and be able to derive interesting consequences from those facts. Some examples of properties that onemight look at are measurability, boundedness, continuity, differentiabili ty, smoothness, analyticity, integra-bility, or quick decay at infinity. One is thus led to consider interesting general classes of functions: to form such a class one chooses a property and takes the setof all functions with that property. Generally speaking, analysis is much more concerned with these general classes of functions than with individual functions. (See also This approach can in fact be useful even when one function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces).) is analyzing a single function that is very structured and has an explicit formula. It is not always easy, oreven possible, to exploit this structure and formula in a purely algebraic manner, and then one must rely (atleast in part) on more analytical tools instead. A typical example is the Airy function\infty Ai$(x) =−$\infty(ei)(xξ+ ξ 3 ) dξ. Although this is defined explicitly as a certain integral, if one wants to answer such basic questions as whether Aiintegral goes to zero as(x) is always a convergent integral, and whether thisx → ±\infty, it is easiest to proceed using the tools of harmonic analysis. In this case, onecan use a technique known as the principle of stationary phase although there is the rather surprising fact that the Airyto answer both these questions affirmatively, function decays almost exponentially fast asbut only polynomially fast as$x$ → −$\i\text{nf ty}$. x → +\infty, ticularly concerned not just with qualitative proper-ties like the ones mentioned earlier, but also with Harmonic analysis, as a subfield of analysis, is par quantitative bounds instance, instead of merely knowing that a function that relate to those properties. For fit is. That is, what is theis bounded, one may wish to know smallest M ⩾how0 such that bounded|ber is known as thef (x)| ⩽ M for all (or almost all)sup norm or Lx\infty -norm\in  R; this num-off , and is denoted square integrable one can quantify this by intro duc in gf L\infty  . Or instead of assuming that f is theone can quantify L2-norm f Lp2 th-power integrability for 0= ( |f (x)|2 dx()1()/){2}; more generally$< p < \i\text{nf ty}$ via themost of the other qualitative properties mentioned$L^{p} - norm (f^{L})^{p} = ( |f (x)|^{p} dx()^{1})^{/}p$. Similarly, above can be quantified by a variety of norms [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces), 450 \text{which assign a nonnegative number} (or+\infty) to any given function and which provide some quantitative measure of one characteristic of that function. besides being of importance in pure harmonic analysis, quantitative estimates involving these norms are also usefulin applied mathematics, for instance in performing an error analysis of some numerical algorithm.Functions tend to have infinitely many degrees of freedom, and it is thus unsurprising that the numberof norms one can place on a function is infinite as well: there are many ways of quantifying how “large” a func-tion is. These norms can often differ quite dramatically from each other. For instance, if a function large for just a few values, so that its graph has tall, f is very thin “spikes,” then it will have a very large L \infty - norm, but|f (x)| dx, its L1-norm, may well be quite small. Conversely, ifthen it is possible forf has a very broad and spread-out graph,|f (x)| dx to be very large even iflarge|f (x)L1|-norm but a smallis small for every L\infty x-norm. Similar examples: such a function has a can be constructed to show that thetimes behaves very differently from either the L2 - \text{norm some} - L1 - normor the L\infty -norm. However, it turns out that the L2-norm lies “between” these two norms, in the sense that if one controls both the L1-norm and the L\infty -norm, then one also automatically controls thereason is that if the L\infty -norm is not too large then one L2-norm. Intuitively, the eliminates all the spiky functions, and if the L1 - \text{norm is}small then one eliminates most of the broad functions; the remaining functions end up being well-behaved in the intermediate L2-norm. More quantitatively, we have the inequality(f L)2 ⩽ (f1()L()/){1}2 (f1()L)/ \infty2, \text{which follows easily from the trivial algebraic fact thatif}|f (x)| ⩽ M, then |f (x)|2 ⩽ M |f (x)|. \text{This inequality} \text{is a special case ofis one of the fundamental inequalities in harmonich}ölder’s inequality [V.19](/part - 05/inequalities), \text{which analysis}. \text{The idea that control of two} “extreme” \text{norms automatically implies further control on} “intermediate” \text{norms can be generalized tremendously and leadsto very powerful and convenient methods known as interpolation The study of a single function and all its norms}, \text{which is another basic tool in this area}. \text{eventually gets somewhat tiresome}, though. \text{Nearly allfields of mathematics become a lot more interesting when one considers not just objects}, \text{but also between objects}. \text{In our case}, \text{the objects in question maps are functions}, and, \text{as was mentioned in the introduc} - tion, \text{a map that takes functions to functions is usually IV}. \text{Branches of Mathematics referred to as ancalled a transform operator}[III.91](/part - 03/transforms).) Operators may seem like. (In some contexts it is also fairly complicated mathematical objects—their inputsand outputs are functions, which in turn have inputs and outputs that are usually numbers—but they are infact a very natural concept since there are many situations where one wants to transform functions. For example, differentiation can be thought of as an operator, which takes a function This operator has a well-known (partial) inverse, f to its derivative df /inte-dx. gration, which takesf to the function Fthat is defined by the formula

$F(x) =^{−}∞^{x} f (y)dy$.

A less intuitive, but particularly important, exampleis the fourier transform [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform). This takesf to a function ˆf , given by the formula\inftyf (x)ˆ=−\infty (e-2()π){i}xy f (y)dy.

It is also of interest to consider operators that taketwo or more inputs. Two particularly common examples are theg are two functions, then their pointwise product pointwise product and convolution. If f andf g is defined in the obvious way:

$(f g)(x) = f (x)g(x)$.

The convolution, denoted$f^{*} g$, is defined as follows: $f^{*} g(x) =^{−}$\infty$\i\text{nf ty} f (y)g(x - y) dy$. This is just a very small sample of interesting opera-tors that one might look at. The original purpose of harmonic analysis was to understand the operators that were connected to Fourier analysis, real analysis, and complex analysis. Nowadays, however, the subject has grown considerably, and the methods of harmonic analysis have been brought to bear on a much broader set of operators. For example, they have been particularly fruitful in understanding the solutions of vari-ous linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, since the solution of any such equation can be viewed as an operator applied to the initial conditions. Theyare also very useful in analytic and combinatorial number theory, when one is faced with understanding the oscillation present in various expressions such as exponential sums. Harmonic analysis has also been appliedto analyze operators that arise in geometric measure theory, probability theory, ergodic theory, numerical analysis, and differential geometry.A primary concern of harmonic analysis is to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about

IV.11. Harmonic Analysis

the effects of these operators on generic functions.A typical example of a quantitative estimate is the inequality

$f^{*} g^{L} \i\text{nf ty} ⩽ (f^{L})^{2} (g^{L})^{2}$,

which is true for all$f$, g \in L2. This result, which is a special case ofjust writes out the definition of Young’s inequality$f$, is easy to prove: one$^{*} g(x) \text{and applies}$ the cauchy–schwarz inequality [V.19](/part - 05/inequalities). As a consequence, one can draw the qualitative conclusion thatthe convolution of two functions in$L^{2} \text{is always con}-$ tinuous. Let us briefly sketch the argument, since it is an instructive one.A fundamental fact about functions in$L^{2} \text{is that any}$ such function(in the$L^{2}$-norm) by a function  ̃f can be approximated arbitrarily wellf that is continuous and compactly supported$f$ ̃ takes the value zero every where outside some inter-. (The second condition means that val$f$ ̃ and  ̃[-M, M]g be approximations of this kind. It is an exercise.) Given any two functions f and g in L2, let in real analysis to prove that  ̃$f^{*} g$ ̃ is continuous, and it follows easily from the inequality above that  ̃close tof* g in the L\infty -norm, since f* g ̃ is $f^{*} g - f$ ̃$^{*} g$ ̃$= f^{*} (g - g) ̃$+ (f - f ) ̃$^{*} g$. ̃ Therefore, in the L\infty -norm by continuous functions. A standardf* g can be approximated arbitrarily well result in basic real analysis (that a uniform limit of con-tinuous functions is continuous) now tells us that$f^{*} g$ is continuous. occurs frequently in harmonic analysis. First, one iden-Notice the general structure of this argument, which tifies a “simple” class of functions for which one caneasily prove the result one wants. Next, one proves that every function in a much wider class can be approximated in a suitable sense by simple functions. Finally, one uses this information to deduce that the result holds for functions in the wider class as well. In our case, the simple functions were the continuous func-tions of finite support, the wider class consisted of square-integrable functions, and the suitable sense of approximation was closeness in the$L^{2} - norm$. tive and quantitative analysis of operators in the next We shall give some further examples of qu al it a section. 2 Example: Fourier Summation To illustrate the interplay between quantitative and qualitative results, we shall now sketch some of the

basic theory of summation of Fourier series, which his-torically was one of the main motivations for studying harmonic analysis.In this section, we shall consider functionsf that are periodicf (x + 2π)\text{with period} 2 = f (x) \text{for all}π: that is, functions such thatx. An example of such a func- tion isf (x) = 3 + \sin (x) - 2 cos(3 x). A function like this, which can be written as a finite linear combina-tion of functions of the form sin(nx) and cos(nx), is called a trigonometric polynomial. The word “polynomial” is used here because any such function can beexpressed as a polynomial in sin(x) and cos(x), or alternatively, and somewhat more conveniently, as apolynomial in ei$x and (e^{-i})^{x}$. That is, it can be written asficients$N^{n}=−(c^{N} c^{n}e$: inx-Nfor some⩽ n ⩽ NN)and some choice of coef-. If we know that f can be expressed in this form, then we can work out the coefficient ncn quite easily: it is given by the formula

$c^{n} = 21π^{0}^{2}^{π} f (x)(e^{-i})^{n}x dx$.

can say something similar about a much wider class offunctions—if, that is, we now allow It is a remarkable and very important fact that weinfinite linear combinations. Suppose thatalso continuous (or, more generally, thatf is a periodic function that isf is absolutely integrable, meaning that the integral of|f (x)| between 0 and 2 ficientsπf (n)ˆ is finite). We can then define theoff , using exactly the formula we had Fourier coef- above for$c^{n}$:

This takes a function N the Dirichlet summationf to the function SN fthat is defined by the formula

SN f (x) =n=−N N f (n)ˆ einx.

The question we would like to answer is whether converges tof as N → $\i\text{nf ty}$. The answer turns out to SN f be surprisingly complicated: not only does it depend

452

on the assumptions that one places on the function but it also depends critically on how one defines “con-f , vergence.” For example, if we assume thatf is con- tinuous and ask for the convergence to be uniform, then the answer is very definitely no: there are examples of continuous functions even converge pointwise toff. However, if we ask forfor which SN f does not a weaker form of convergence, the answer is yes: will necessarily converge tof in the Lp topology for SN f any 0< p < \infty , and even though it does not have to converge pointwise, it will converge where, meaning that the set ofx for which almost every-SN f (x) does not converge toone assumes only thatx has measuref is absolutely integrable, then[III.55](/part-03/measures) zero. If instead it is possible for the partial sums SNf to diverge at every single point Lp topology for everyx, as well as being divergent in thep such that 0 < p ⩽ \infty . The proofs of all of these results ultimately rely on very quantitative results in harmonic analysis, and in particular on various Lp -type estimates on the Dirichlet sum SN f (x), as well as estimates connected with the closely related function sup maximal operator|S f (x)|. , which takes f to the discuss a simpler result, in which the Dirichlet summa-tion operators As these results are a little tricky to prove, let us first N>S0 \text{are replaced by the}NFejér summation operators age of the first FN.

It is not hard to show that ifso does FN f . However, by averaging the SN f converges to SN f we allowf , then cancellations to take place that sometimes make it pos-sible for F f to converge to f even when S f does not. Indeed, here is a sketch of a proof thattof whenever N fis continuous and periodic—which, as$(F^{N})^{N}f converges$ we have seen, is far from true of In its basic structure, the argument is similar to the$S^{N} f$. one we used when showing that the convolution oftwo functions in L2 is continuous.

In reassembling the estimates fromthe individual components, one can use crude tools such as the triangle inequality or more refined tools, for instance those relying on some sort of orthogonality, or perhaps a clever algorithm that groups the com-ponents into manageable clusters. The main drawback of the decomposition method (other than an aesthetic one) is that it tends to give bounds that are not quite optimal; however, in many cases one is content with anestimate that differs from the best possible one by a multiplicative constant.To give a simple example of the method of decomposition, let us consider the Fourier transform ˆfunction$f$: R$\to C$, defined (for suitably nice functionsf (ξ) of af ) by the formulaf (ξ)ˆ$=^{R} f (x)(e^{-2}()^{π})^{{}i}^{x}ξ dx$.

In other words, what happens Lp is not contained in eitherf lies in L1 ordirectly. However, let us take a function$L2$, one cannot use either of the above two resultsf \in  Lp and consider what the difficulty is.

attempt to quantify the elusive phenomenon oftion Another basic theme in harmonic analysis is the. Intuitively, if an expression oscillates wildly, then oscil la we expect its average value to be relatively small in magnitude, since the positive and negative parts, or inthe complex case the parts with a wide range of different arguments, will cancel out. For instance, if a 2 periodic functionf is smooth, then for large n theπ-

This assertion can eas-f (x) is not enough to ily be proved rigorously by repeated integration byparts. Generalizations of this phenomenon include the so-called principle of stationary phase, which among other things allows one to obtain precise control onthe Airy function Ai(x) discussed earlier. It also yields the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates thedecay and smoothness of a function to the decay and smoothness of its Fourier transform.A somewhat different manifestation of oscillation lies in the principle that if one has a sequence of func-tions that oscillate in different ways, then their sum should be significantly smaller than the bound that follows from the triangle inequality. Again, this is the result of cancellation that is simply not noticed by the triangle inequality. For instance, the Plancherel theo-rem in Fourier analysis implies, among other things, that a trigonometric polynomial$L^{2} - norm o(f^{N})^{n}=−^{N} c^{n}(e^{i})^{n}x \text{has an}$ 2$π^{N}^{2}^{1}^{/}^{2}^{N}^{1}^{/}^{2}$ 2$π^{0}^{n}=−^{N} c^{n}(e^{i})^{n}x =^{n}=−^{N} |c^{n}|^{2}$. This bound (which can also be proved by direct calcu-lation) is smaller than the upper bound of N |c | that would be obtained if we simply applied the trian-gle inequality to the functions$c (e^{i})^{n}x$. \text{This identity can}n=−N n be viewed as a special case of the Pythagorean theo-rem, together with the observation that the harmonics$n$ einx are all orthogonal to each other with respect to the inner product [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis)

$f$, g = 21π0 2 π f (x)g(x) dx.

This concept of orthogonality has been generalized ina number of ways. For instance, there is a more general and robust concept of “almost orthogonality,” which roughly speaking means that the inner products of acollection of functions are small but not necessarily 0.

The difficulty one faces in trying to describe the subject of PDEs starts with its very definition. Is it a unified area of mathematics, devoted to the study of a clearly defined set of objects (in the way that algebraic geometry studies solutions of polynomial equations or topology studies manifolds, for example), or is it rather a collection ofseparate fields, such as general relativity, several complex variables, or hydrodynamics, each one vast in its own right and centered on a particular, very difficult, equation or class of equations? I will attempt to argue

below that, even though there are fundamental difficul-ties in formulating a general theory of PDEs, one can nevertheless find a remarkable unity between various branches of mathematics and physics that are centeredon individual PDEs or classes of PDEs. In particular, certain ideas and methods in PDEs have turned out to be extraordinarily effective across the boundaries of these separate fields. It is thus no surprise that the most successful book ever written about PDEs did not mention PDEs in its title: it was Methods of Mathematical Physics by As it is impossible to do full justice to such a huge courant [VI.83](/part-06/richard-courant-18881972) and hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943). \text{subject in such limited space} I \text{have been forced to leaveout many topics and relevant details}; \text{in particular}, I \text{have said very little about the fundamental issue ofbreakdown of solutions}, \text{and there is no discussion of the main open problems in PDEs}.

(We will use this shorthand through out the article.) Two other funda-mental examples (also described in [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) are the heat equation and the wave equation:

view they are not important, since ifa solution of (3), for example, thenv(t$, xu(t, x^{1}$, x, x2, x, x3)) is=u(t, xc = 1. Thus, when one is studying the equations one1/c, x2/c, x3/c)satisfies the same equation with1 2 3 can set these constants to be 1. Both equations arecalled evolution equations because they are supposed to describe the change of a particular physical objectas the time parametert varies.

The first is the schrödinger equation [III.83](/part-03/the-schrdinger-equation), i$\partial u + k\Delta u = 0$, (4)t

whereu is a function from R \times  R3 to C. This equation describes the quantum evolution of a massive particle,$k = /2m$, where >0 is Planck’s constant andm is the mass of the particle. As with the heat equation, onecan setk to equal 1 after a simple change of variables. Though the equation is formally very similar to the heat equation, it has very different qualitative behavior. this illustrates an important general point about PDEs: that small changes in the form of an equation can lead tovery different properties of solutions. A further example is the Klein–Gordon equation

$-\partial^{2}u + c^{2}\Delta u - m(c^{2})^{2}u = 0$. (5)t

This is the relativistic counterpart to the Schrödinger equation: the parameter tat i on of mass andmc2 mhas the physical interpreta-has the physical interpre- tion of rest energy (reflecting Einstein’s famous equa-tion E = mc2). One can normalize the constants c andmc^2/ so that they both equal 1 by applying a suitable change of variables to time and space.Though all five equations mentioned above first appeared in connection with specific physical phenom-ena, such as heat transfer for (2) and propagation of electromagnetic waves for (3), they have, miraculously, a range of relevance far beyond their original applica-tions. In particular there is no reason to restrict their study to three space dimensions: it is very easy to

Laplacian Our basic constant-coefficient linear operators, theΔand the d’Alembertian , are formally similar in many respects. The Laplacian is fundamen-tally associated with the geometry of euclidean space [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) R3 and the d’Alembertian is similarly associated with the geometry of R1$+3$. This means that the Laplacian commutes with minkowski space[I.3 §6.8](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) all the rigid motions of the Euclidean space R3, while the d’Alembertian commutes with the corresponding class of Poincaré transformations of Minkowski spacetime. In the former case this simply means that invari-ance applies to all transformations of R3 that preserve the Euclidean distances between points. In the case of the wave equation, the Euclidean distance has tobe replaced by the spacetime distance between points (which would be called ti vi ty): if P = (t, x , x , xevents) andin the language of rela-Q(s, y , y , y ), then the distance between them is given by the formula1 2 3 1 2 3

Finally, \text{nonlinear equations such as} (7) \text{can often still be written in the form} (8), but the operator P is now a nonlinear differential operator. For instance, the relevant operator for (7) is given by the formula $P[u] =^{2} \partial^{i} (1 + |\partial u1 |^{2}()^{1}()^{/})^{{}2} \partial^{i}u$, whereare clearly not linear. However, because they are ulti-$|\partial u|^{2} = (\partial^{1}u)^{i}=^{1}^{2}+(\partial^{2}u)^{2}$. Operators such as these mately constructed from algebraic operations and par-tial derivatives, both of which are “local” operations, we observe the important fact that P is at least still a “local” operator.

Under determined equations typically have infinitely many solutions for any given set of prescribed data; conversely, over determined equations tend to have no solutions at all, unless some additional compatibility conditions are imposed on the prescribed data.Observe also that the Cauchy–Riemann operator$P$ has the following remarkable property:

$P^{2}[u] = P[P[u]] = \Delta \1eltau(u^{1})^{2}$.

Thus P can be viewed as a square root of the two- dimensional LaplacianΔ. One can define a similar type

Moreover, the start-ing point of a quantum field theory [IV.17 §2.1.4](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras) is always a classical field theory, which is described by

systems of PDEs. This is the case, for example, in the standard model of weak and strong interactions, which is based on the so-called Yang–Mills–Higgs field theory.If we also include the ordinary differential equations of classical mechanics, which can be viewed as one-dimensional PDEs, we see that essentially all of physics is described by differential equations. As examples of PDEs underlying some of our most basic physical theo-ries we refer to the articles that discuss the euler and navier–stokes equations [III.23](/part-03/the-euler-and-navierstokes-equations), the heat equation the einstein equations[III.36](/part-03/the-heat-equation), the schrödinger equation[IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations).

The mathematical theory dealing with these types of issues is called control theory. cannot possibly have complete information about thestate of the system at any given time. Instead, one When dealing with complex physical systems, one often makes certain randomness assumptions about various factors that influence it. This leads to the very important class of equations called stochastic differential equations the equation involve a(SDEs), where one or more components ofrandom variable [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) of some sort.

A general dis-stochastic processes [IV.24 §6](/part-04/stochastic-processes).The plan for the rest of this article is as follows. In section 2 I shall describe some of the basic notions and achievements of the general theory of PDEs. The main point I want to make here is that, in contrast with ordinary differential equations, for which a gen-eral theory is both possible and useful, partial differential equations do not lend themselves to a useful gen-eral theoretical treatment because of some important obstructions that I shall try to describe. One is thus forced to discuss special classes of equations such as elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic, and dispersive equations. In section 3 I will try to argue that, despite the impossi-bility of developing a useful general theory that encompasses all, or most, of the important examples, there is nevertheless an impressive unifying body of concepts and methods for dealing with various basic equations, and this gives PDEs the feel of a well-defined area of mathematics. In section 4 I develop this further by try-ing to identify some common features in the derivation of the main equations that are dealt with in the subject.An additional source of unity for PDEs is the central role played by the issues of regularity and breakdown of solutions, which is discussed only briefly here. In thefinal section we shall discuss some of the main goals that can be identified as driving the subject. 2 General Equations One might expect, after looking at other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry or topology, thatthere was a very general theory of PDEs that could be specialized to various specific cases. As I shall argue below, this point of view is seriously flawed and very much out of fashion. It does, however, have important merits, which I hope to illustrate in this section. I shall avoid giving formal definitions and focus instead on representative examples. The reader who wants more precise definitions can consult the online version of this article. systems of PDEs. The simplest distinction, which wehave already made, is between scalar equations, such For simplicity we shall look mostly at determined as (1)–(5), which consist of only one equation and one unknown, and systems of equations, such as (12) and (13). Another simple but important concept is that of the derivative that appears in the equation; this concept isorder of a PDE, which is defined to be the highest

analogous to that of the instance, the five basic equations (1)–(5) listed earlier degree of a polynomial. For are second order in space, although some (such as (2)or (4)) are only first order in time. Equations (12) and (13), as well as the Maxwell equations, are first order.1 nonlinear equations, with the linear equations being divided further into constant-coefficient and variable-We have seen that PDEs can be divided into linear and coefficient equations. One can also divide nonlinear PDEs into several further classes depending on the “strength” of the nonlinearity. At one end of the scale, a semilinear equation is one in which all the nonlinear components of the equation have strictly lower order than the linear components. For instance, equation (15)is semilinear, because the nonlinear component eu is of zero order, i.e., it contains no derivatives, whereasthe linear component\Delta u is of second order. These S

equations are close enough to being linear that they canoften be effectively viewed as perturbations of a linear equation. A more strongly nonlinear class of equationsis that of quasilinear equations, in which the highestorder derivatives ofa linear manner but the coefficients attached to thoseu appear in the equation only in derivatives may depend in some nonlinear manner onlower-order derivatives. For instance, the second-order equation (7) is quasilinear, because if one uses the product rule to expand the equation, then it takes the quasilinear form F11(\partial1 u, \partial2 u)\partial2 1 u + F12(\partial1 u, \partial2 u)\partial1\partial2 u + F22(\partial1 u, \partial2 u)\partial2 2 u = 0 \text{for some explicit algebraic functions}$F11$, F12, F22 \text{of the} lower-\text{order derivatives oftions can still sometimes be analyzed by perturb at i veu}. \text{While quasilinear equa} - techniques, \text{this is generally more difficult to accom}-\text{plish than it is for an analogous semilinear equation}. Finally, \text{we haveno linearity properties whatsoever}. A \text{typical example isfully nonlinear equations}, \text{which exhibit the Monge}–Ampè\text{re equation}$\det (D2 u) = F(x, u, Du)$,

where$u$: Rn \to  R is the unknown function, Du is the gradient Hessian matrix[I.3 §5.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) ofof$u$, andu, DF2 u:$=R^{n}(\partial \1imes^{i}\partial R^{j}u)\times^{1}(R^{⩽}()^{n})^{{}i}$, j^⩽\ton Ris theis a given function.

to the complex geometry of[III.6](/part-03/calabiyau-manifolds). Fully nonlinear equations are among the most calabi–yau manifolds difficult and least well-understood of all PDEs. Remark. Most of the basic equations of physics, such as the Einstein equations, are quasilinear. However, fully nonlinear equations arise in the theory of characteristics of linear PDEs, which we discuss below, andalso in geometry.

2.1 First-Order Scalar Equations

It turns out that first-order scalar PDEs in any num-ber of dimensions can be reduced to systems of firstorder ODEs. As a simple illustration of this impor-tant fact consider the following equation in two space dimensions: a1(x1$, x2)\partial1 u(x1$, x2)+a2(x1$, x2)\partial2 u(x1$, x2)= f (x1$, x2)$, (17) wherex = (x(a1)1, x, a2)2,\in f \text{Rare given real functions in the variables}2. \text{We associate with} (17) \text{the first} - order 2$\times 2 system$ d$x1 (s) = a1(x1(s)$, x2(s)),⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬$d$ s$(18) dd$ xs2 = a2(x1(s)$, x2(s))$.⎪⎪⎪⎭ To simplify matters, let us assume that Suppose now that$x(s) = (x^{1}(s)$, x2(s))f =is a solution0.$of (18)$, and let us consider how$u(x^{1}(s)$, x^2(s)) varies ass varies. By the chain rule we know that$dd$ s u = ∂^1 udds ddxs^1 + ∂^2 uddxs^2 , and equations (17) and (18) imply that this equals zero(by our assumption that$f = 0)$. In other words, any solution$u = u(x^{1}$, x2) of (17) with f = 0 is con- stant along any parametrized curve of the form$(x^{1}(s)$, x2(s))$\text{that satisfies} (18)$.$x(s) =$ which are called(17), then we can find all solutions to (17). I say “in prin-Thus, in principle, if we know the solutions to (18), characteristic curves for the equation ciple” because, in general, the nonlinear system (18) isnot so easy to solve. Nevertheless, ODEs are simpler to deal with, and the fundamental theorem of ODEs, whichwe will discuss later in this section, allows us to solve (18) at least locally and for a small interval in The fact thatu is constant along characteristic curvess. allows us to obtain important qualitative information even when we cannot find explicit solutions. For exam-ple, suppose that the coefficients a1, a2 \text{are smooth} (\text{or IV}.12. \text{Partial Differential Equations real analytic}) \text{and that the initial data is smooth} (\text{or realanalytic}) \text{every where on the set Hwhere it is defined}, \text{except at some pointthe solutionu remains smooth} (\text{or real analytic}) atx0 \text{where it is discontinuous}. \text{Then all points except along the} \text{characteristic} curveΓ \text{that starts at}(18) \text{that satisfies the initial condition} x0, or, in other words, along the solution tox(0) = x .

We see here the simplest manifestation of an impor- later: singularities of solutions to PDEs propagate along characteristics (or, more generally, hypersurfaces). cientsbut also on One can generalize equation (17) to allow the coeffi-$a1$, a2 u, and: f to depend not only on x = (x1$, x2)a1(x$, u(x))∂1 u(x)+a2(x, u(x))∂2 u(x) = f (x, u(x)).(19) \text{The associated} \text{characteristic} \text{system becomes}⎫$dd$ xs1 (s) = a1(x(s), u(s, x(s))),⎪⎪⎪⎬$(20) dd$ xs^2 (s) = a^2(x(s), u(s, x(s))).⎪⎪⎪⎭ As a special example of (19) consider the scalar equation in two space dimensions,\partial t u + u\partial x u = 0$, u(0, x) = u0(x)$, (21) \text{which is called thea}1(x, u(x)) = 1 \text{and Burgers equationa}2(x, u(x)) =. \text{Here we have setu}(x).

For any given solution curve(s, x(s)) we haveu(dof (21) and any characteristic/ds)u(s, x(s)) = 0. Thus, in principle, knowing the solutions to (22) should allow usto determine the solutions to (21). However, this argument seems worryingly circular, sincein (22).u itself appears sider the IVP for (21): that is, look for solutions that satisfy To see how this difficulty can be circumvented, con- u(0$, x) = u (x)$. \text{Consider an associated char}- \text{acteristic curve Then}, \text{sinceu is constant along the curve}, \text{we must havex}(s)0 \text{such that}, initially, x(0) = x0.u(s, x(s))\text{that dx}/ds==uu0(x(x0)).

This blow-up phenomenon occurs for anyu . Remark.linear equation (17) and the quasilinear equation (19).There is an important difference between the The characteristics of the first depend only on the coef-ficients$a1(x)$, a2(x), while the characteristics of the second depend explicitly on a particular solution the equation.

Briefly, we can constructa solutionu to (24) based only on the knowledge of the solutions the bi characteristic curves(x(t), p(t))of the nonlinear PDE$. Onceto (25)$, which are called again, singularities can only propagate along bichar-acteristic curves (or hypersurfaces). As in the case of

464

the Burgers equation, singularities will occur for moreor less any smooth data. Thus, a classical, continuously differentiable solution can only be constructed locally in time. Both Hamilton–Jacobi equations and Hamiltonian systems play a fundamental role in clas-sical mechanics as well as in the theory of the propagation of singularities in linear PDEs. The deep con-nection between Hamiltonian systems and first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations played an important rolein the introduction of the Schrödinger equation into quantum mechanics.

2.2 The Initial Value Problem for ODEs

Before we can continue with our general presentation of PDEs we need first to discuss, for the sake of com-parison, the IVP for ODEs. Let us start with a first-order

ODE\partial xu(x) = f (x, u(x)) (26) \text{subject to the initial condition}$u(x0) = u0$. (27) \text{Let us also assume for simplicity that} (26) \text{is a scalar equation and thatu}, \text{such as} f (x, u)f=\text{is a well}-\text{behaved function ofu}3 - u + 1 + \sin x. \text{From the initialx and}$datainto (26)$. \text{If we now differentiate the equation} (26) withu0 \text{we can determine} \partial x u(x0) \text{by substituting} x0 \text{respect toequationx and apply the chain rule}, \text{we derive the}\partial2 xu(x) = \partial x f (x, u(x)) + \partial uf (x, u(x))\partial x u(x), which for the example just defined works out to be$\cos x + 3u^{2}(x)\partial u(x) - \partial u(x)$. Hence, xx\partial x 2 u(x0) = \partial xf (x0, u0) + \partial uf (x0, u0)∂x u0, and sincefind that∂∂2 xu(xu(x0)) can also be explicitly calculated has already been determined we from the initial datathe functionx fand its first partial derivatives. Taking0$u^{0}$. This calculation also involves higher derivatives of the equation (26) we can recur-sively determine$\partial^{3}u(x )$, as well as all other higher derivatives of de term i neu(x)u with the help of the Taylor seriesatxx0. Therefore, one can in principle0 u(x) =k^⩾0 k1!$\partia(l^{x})^{k}u(x^{0})(x - x^{0})^{k} = u(x^{0}) + \partial^{x} u(x^{0})(x - x^{0})+$2!1$\partial x 2(x0)(x - x0)2 + · · ·$.

We say “in principle” because there is no guarantee thatthe series converges. There is, however, a very important theorem, called the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theoremlytic, as is certainly the case for our function, which asserts that if the functionf is real ana-f (x, u) =u3 - u + 1 + \sin  x, then there will be some neighbor- hood J of x0 where the Taylor series converges to a real-analytic solutionto show that the solution thus obtained is the uniqueu of the equation. It is then easy solution to (26) that satisfies the initial condition (27).To summarize: iff is a well-behaved function, then the initial value problem for ODEs has a solution, at leastin some time interval, and that solution is unique. The same result does not always hold if we consider a more general equation of the form a(x$, u(x))\partial^{x}u = f (x, u(x))$, u(x^0) = u^0. (28) Indeed, the recursive argument outlined above breaks down in the case of the scalar equation(x - x )∂ u =f (x, u)determine for the simple reason that we cannot even∂ u(x ) from the initial condition u((x0)x ) =uu0. A similar problem occurs for the equation)∂ u = f (x, u()x)0. An obvious condition that allows us(u0 - to extend our previous recursive argument to (28) is toinsist that0 x a(x , u ) ≠ 0. Otherwise, we say that the IVP (28) \text{is characteristic}0 0 . \text{If both}a and f are also real ana- lytic, the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem applies againand we obtain a unique, real-analytic solution of (28) in a small neighborhood ofsystem,$x0$. In the case of an N \times  NA(x$, u(x))\partial x u = F(x, u(x))$, u(x0) = u0$, A = A(x$, u) is an N \times  N matrix, and the non character- istic condition becomes

$\det A(x^{0}$, u0) ≠ 0. (29)

2.3 The Initial Value Problem for PDEs

In the one-dimensional situation one specifies initial conditions at a point. The natural higher-dimensional may not be analytic, but it does have continuous first derivatives.2. Since we are not assuming that3. Since A is invertible we can multiply both sides of the equation A and F are analytic, the solution by the inverse matrix$A^{-1}$.

analogue is to specify them on hypersurfaces H ⊂ Rd, that is,(d - 1)-dimensional subsets (or, to be more pre- cise, submanifolds). For a general equation of orderk, that is, one that involves ify the values ofuand of its firstk derivatives, we need to spec-k - 1 derivatives in the direction normal to H. For example, in the case of the second-order wave equation (3) and the initial hyper planet = 0 we need to specify initial data for u and\partial u.t \text{obtaining a solution}, \text{it is important that the data If we wish to use initial data of this kind to start should not be degenerate}.

The values of0 uand the firstk - 1 normal derivatives on this inter- section are given by the initial data, and the problemof determining the other partial derivatives is a problem in linear algebra (because everything is infinitesi-mally small). To say that the system is non characteristic atx0 is to say that this linear algebra problem can be uniquely solved, which is the case provided that acertain matrix is invertible. This is the nondegeneracy condition referred to earlier.To illustrate the idea, let us look at first-order equations in two space dimensions. In this caseΓ , and since k - 1 = 0 we must specify the restriction H is a curve$of$ u to Γ ⊂ R2 but we do not have to worry about any derivatives. Thus, we are trying to solve the system $a^{1}(x$, u(x))∂1 u(x) + a2(x, u(x))∂2 u(x)= f (x, u(x))$, u|^{Γ} = u^{0}$, (30)

This is the case, in particular, for the laplace equationΔu = f . Consider also the minimal surface equation (7) written in the form

withh12(∂u)h11(∂u)= h21=(∂u)1 += −(∂2 u)∂2 u∂, h22 u. It is easy to check(∂u) = 1 + (∂1 u)2, that the quadratic form associated with the symmetric matrixhij(∂u)is positive definite for every1 2∂u. Indeed, hij(\partial u)ξiξj= (1 + |\partial u|2)-1/2(|ξ|2 - (1 + |\partial u|2)-1(ξ · \partial u)2) > 0. Thus, even though (36) is not linear, we see that all surfaces in R2 are non characteristic. Example. Consider the wave equation$u = f in R1^{+}d$. All hypersurfaces of the formψ(t, x) = 0 \text{for which}(\partial tψ)2 =i=d 1(\partial iψ)2 (37)

Remark.(17) we have seen how knowledge of characteristics In the case of the first-order scalar equations can be used to find, implicitly, general solutions. Wehave also seen that singularities propagate only along characteristics. In the case of second-order equations the characteristics are not sufficient to solve the equa-tions, but they continue to provide important information, such as how the singularities propagate.

In particular, if there are no such characteristic hyper-surfaces, then any solution of the equation must be smooth (or real analytic) at every point ofthanp. V other Remarks. (i) The heuristic principle mentioned above is invalid, in general, at large scales. Indeed, as we haveshown in the case of the Burgers equation, solutions to nonlinear evolution equations can develop new sin-gularities whatever the smoothness of the initial conditions.

A first limitation becomes immediately apparent when we consider the wave equation$u = 0$. A fundamental feature of this equation is propagation, which means, roughly speaking, that if atfinite speed of some timeset, then the same must be true at all later times.t a solution u is zero outside some bounded However, analytic functions cannot have this property unless they are identically zero (see some fundamental mathematical definitions it is impossible to discuss the wave equation properly[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)).

The different behavior of the Laplace and wave equa-tions mentioned above illustrates the fundamental difference between ODEs and PDEs and the illusory generality of the CK theorem. Given that these two equations are so important in geometric and physical applications, it is of great interest to find the broadest classesof equations with which they share their main properties.

We say that the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation is well-posed.

This problem is well-posed for all continu-ous functions\partial D fdefined on\partial D with zero mean aver- age. A typical problem of general theory is to classify all well-posed BVPs for a given elliptic system.As a consequence of our propagation-of-singularities principle, we deduce, heuristically at least, the follow-ing general fact: Classical solutions of elliptic equations with smooth(or real-analytic) coefficients in a regular domain D are smooth (or real analytic) in the interior ofthe degree of smoothness of the boundary conditions. D, whatever6 the IVP is well-posed. In that sense, they provide the natural class of equations for which one can prove Hyperbolic equations are, essentially, those for which a result similar to the local existence theorem for ODEs. More precisely, for each sufficiently regular set of initial conditions there is a unique solution. We can well-posed.

However, it fails to be well-posed for timelike hypersurfaces, for which there may be no solution with prescribed, nonanalytic, Cauchy data. hyperbolicity. Roughly speaking, hyperbolic equations are at the opposite end of the spectrum from ellip-It is more difficult to give algebraic conditions for tic equations: whereas elliptic equations have no char-acteristic hypersurfaces, hyperbolic equations have as many as possible passing through any given point. Oneof the most useful classes of hyperbolic equations, which includes most of the important known examples, consists of equations of the form $A^{0}(t$, x, u)∂tu +i=d 1 Ai(t, x, u)∂iu = F(t, x, u)$, u|H = u0$, (42) \text{where all the coefficients}$A0$, A1, . . . , Ad are symmetric N \times  N matrices and H is given by ψ(t, x) = 0. Such a system is well-posed provided that the matrix A0(t, x, u)∂tψ(t, x) +i=d 1 Ai(t, x, u)∂iψ(t, x) (43) is positive definite. A system (42) that satisfies these conditions is called symmetric hyperbolic. In the particular case whenψ(t$, x) = t, \text{the condition} (43) becomes$(A0ξ, ξ) ⩾ c|ξ|2 ∀ξ \in  RN.

The following is a fundamental result in the theoryof general hyperbolic equations. It is called the local existence and uniqueness of solutions for symmetric hyperbolic systems.

Remarks.essential, just as it was for the general propagation-(i) The local character of the theorem is of-singularities principle discussed earlier, since the result cannot be globalized in the particular case ofthe Burgers equation (21), which fits trivially into the framework of general nonlinear symmetric hyperbolic systems. A precise version of the theorem above gives a lower bound on how large D can be. (ii) The proof of the theorem is based on a variation ofthe Picard iteration method that we encountered earlier for ODEs. One starts by takinghood of$H$. Then one defines functions(u(()0){)} = uu0 \text{in a neighbor} - recursively(n)

as follows:

$A^{0}(t$, x, u((n-1)))∂tu(n) +i=d 1 Ai(t, x, u((n-1)))∂iu(n)= F(t, x, u((n-1)))$, u^{(}n)|H = u^{0}$.

Notice that at each stage of the iteration we have to solve a linear equation. Linearization is an extremely important tool in studying nonlinear PDEs. We can almost never understand their behavior without lineariz-ing them around important special solutions. Thus, almost invariably, hard problems in nonlinear Pdes reduce to understanding specific problems in linear PDEs. (iii) To implement the Picard iteration method we needto get precise estimates concerning$u \text{in terms ofu}^{(}(n^{-1})^{)}$. This step requires energy type a priori esti-^(n) mates, which we will discuss in section 3.3.

The Lewy operator is intimately connected to the tangential Cauchy–Riemann equations on the Heisenberg group in C2. It was discovered in the study of the restriction of the two-dimensional analogue of the Cauchy–riemann operator P to a quadric in C^2. This example was the starting point for the theory ofgoal is to characterize linear equations that are locally local solvability, whose solvable. The theory of Cauchy–Riemann manifolds—which has its origin in the study of restrictions of the Cauchy–Riemann equations (in higher dimensions)to real hypersurfaces, each of which comes with an associated “tangential Cauchy–Riemann complex”—is another extremely rich source of examples of inter-esting linear PDEs, which do not fit into the standard classification.

2.6.2 Unique Continuation

This concerns various ill-posed problems where solu-tions may not always exist, but one still has uniqueness. A fundamental example is that oftinuation: two holomorphic functions on a connected analytic condomainor an interval) must necessarily agree every where on D that agree on a nondiscrete set (such as a disk D. This fact can be viewed as a unique continuation resultfor the Cauchy–Riemann equations (12). Another example in a similar spirit is Holmgren’s theorem, which asserts that solutions to a linear PDE (9) that has real-analytic coefficients and data are unique, even in the class of smooth functions. More generally, the study of

472

ill-posed problems (such as the wave equation with pre-scribed data on a timelike surface rather than a spacelike one) arises naturally in connection with control theory.

2.6.3 Spectral Theory

There is no way I can even begin to give an accountof this theory, which is of fundamental importance not only to quantum mechanics and other physical theories, but also to geometry and analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Just as a matrix A can often be analyzed through itsby the tools of linear algebra, one can learn much about eigenvalues and eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) a linear differential operator P and its associated PDE by understanding that operator’se i gen functions with the help of tools from spectrum functional[III.86](/part-03/the-spectrum) and analysisis the eigenvalue problem[IV.15](/part-04/operator-algebras). A typical problem in spectral theoryin R$d$:

$-\Delta u(x) + V (x)u(x) = \lambda u(x)$.

A function being bounded in theu that is localized in space (for example, by L2(Rd)-norm) and that satisfies this equation is mapped by the linear operator$-\Delta + V$ to the function with eigenvalue\lambda uλ.: we say thatu is an eigenfunctionφ(t, x)solution of the Schrödinger equation Suppose that we have an eigenfunction$= (e^{-i})^{λ}tu(x)$. It is easy to check thatu and letφ is a$i$∂ φ + Δφ - V φ = 0. (47)t

Moreover, it has a very special form. Such solutions arecalled bound states of the physical system described by (47). The eigenvalues correspond to the quantum energy levels of the sys-λ, which form a discrete set, tem. They are very sensitive to the choice of potential V . The inverse spectral problemis also important: can one determine the potential V from knowledge of the corresponding eigenvalues? The eigenvalue problem can be studied in considerable generality by replacing the operator-Δ + V with other elliptic operators. For instance, in geometry it is important to study the eigen-value problem for the Laplace–Beltrami operator, which is the natural generalization of the Laplace operator from Rn to general[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). When the manifold has some arithmetic structure (for instance, if it is the quotient of the upper half-plane by riemannian manifolds a discrete arithmetic group), this problem is of major importance in number theory, leading, for instance, tothe theory of Hecke–Maas forms. A famous problem in differential geometry (“can you hear the shape of

IV. Branches of Mathematics

a drum?”) is to characterize the metric on a compact surface from the spectral properties of the associated Laplace–Beltrami operator.

2.6.4 Scattering Theory

This theory formalizes the intuition from quantum mechanics that a potential which is small or localizedis largely unable to “trap” a quantum particle, which is therefore likely to escape to infinity in a manner resem-bling that of a free particle. In the case of equation (47), solutions that scatter are those that behave freely ast → $\i\text{nf ty}$. That is, they behave like solutions to the free Schrödinger equation i$\partial ψ + \Deltaψ = 0$. A \text{typical prob} - t

lem in scattering theory is to show that, ifto zero sufficiently fast as|x| → $\i\text{nf ty}$, all solutions, except V (x) tends the bound states, scatter ast → $\i\text{nf ty}$.

2.7 Conclusions

In the analytic case, the CK theorem allows us to solvethe IVP locally for very general classes of PDEs. We have a general theory of characteristic hypersurfaces of PDEs and a good general understanding of how they relateto propagation of singularities. We can also distinguish in considerable generality the fundamental classes ofelliptic and hyperbolic equations and can define general parabolic and dispersive equations. The IVP for a large class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems can besolved locally in time, for sufficiently smooth initial conditions. Similar local-in-time results hold for gen-eral classes of nonlinear parabolic and dispersive equations. For linear equations a lot more can be done. We have satisfactory results concerning the regularity of solutions for elliptic and parabolic equations and a good understanding of the propagation of singular-ities for a large class of hyperbolic equations. Some aspects of spectral theory and scattering theory and problems of unique continuation can also be studiedin considerable generality. passage from local to global. Important global featuresof special equations are too subtle to fit into a general The main defect of the general theory concerns the scheme. Rather, each important PDE requires special treatment. This is particularly true for nonlinear equations: the long-term behavior of solutions is very sen-sitive to the special features of the equation at hand. Moreover, general points of view may obscure, through unnecessary technical complications, the main proper-ties of the important special cases. A useful general framework is one that provides a simple and elegant

IV.12. Partial Differential Equations

treatment of a particular phenomenon, as is the case for symmetric hyperbolic systems and the phenomenon of local well-posedness and finite speed of propaga-tion. However, it turns out that symmetric hyperbolic systems are simply too general for the study of more refined questions about the important examples of hyperbolic equations. 3 General Ideas As one turns away from the general theory, one maybe inclined to accept the pragmatic point of view described earlier, according to which PDEs is not areal subject but is rather a collection of subjects such as hydrodynamics, general relativity, several complex variables, elasticity, etc., each organized around a special equation. However, this rather widespread view-point has its own serious drawbacks. Even though specific equations have specific properties, the tools thatare used to derive them are intimately related. In fact, there is an impressive body of knowledge relevant to all important equations, or at least large classes of them.Lack of space does not allow me to do anything more than enumerate them below.9

3.1 Well-Posedness

As is clear from the previous section, well-posed problems are at the heart of the modern theory of PDEs.Recall that these are problems that admit unique solutions for given smooth initial or boundary conditions, and that the corresponding solutions have to depend continuously on the data. It is this condition that leadsto the classification of PDEs into elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and dispersive equations. The first step inthe study of a nonlinear evolution equation is a proof of a local-in-time existence and uniqueness theorem, simi-lar to the one for ODEs. Ill-posedness, the counterpart of well-posedness, is also important in many applications. The Cauchy problem for the wave equation (3), withdata on the timelike hypersurface$z = 0$, \text{is a typical} example. Ill-posed problems appear naturally in con-trol theory, as we have mentioned, and also in inverse scattering. important functional analytic tools connected to Hilbert space meth-ods, compactness, the implicit function theorems, etc. I also fail to9. I fail to mention in the few examples given above some of the mention the importance of probabilistic methods and the develop-ment of topological methods for dealing with global properties of elliptic PDEs.

3.2 Explicit Representations and Fundamental

Solutions

Our basic equations (2)–(5) can be solved explicitly. For example, the solution to the IVP for the heat equationin R1$+d$, that is, the problem of finding a functionu that satisfies$+-\partial^{t}u + \Delta u = 0$, u(0, x) = u0(x),$for$ t ⩾ 0, is given byu(t, x) =^R^d E^d(t, x - y)u^0(y) dy

It is easy to see that ˆequationu(t, ξ)\text{satisfies the differential} ∂tu(t, ξ)ˆ$= −ξ^{2}u(t$, ξ)$,ˆu(ˆ 0$, ξ) = uˆ0(ξ). This can be solved by a simple integration, which results in the formula ˆu(t$, ξ) = u$ˆ$(ξ)(e^{-t}()^{|})^{{}ξ}^{|}^{2}$. Thus, with in10. That is, any function that is smooth and has compact support R1$+d$.

the help of the inverse Fourier transform, we derive aformula foru(t, x): u(t$, x) = (2π()^{-1})^{−}∞^{+}∞ (e^{i})^{x}ξ (e^{-t}()^{|})^{{}ξ}^{|}^{2} u$ˆ0(ξ) dξ. Similar formulas can be derived for our other basic evo-lution equations. For example, in the case of the wave equation-\partial2 u + \Delta u = 0 \text{in three dimensions}, subjectt

(49) After some work, one can reexpress formula (49) in theform u(t$, x) = \partial t (4πt)-1^{(}|x)-y^{|} = t u0(y) da(y)$, (50) where da is the area element of the sphere |x-y | = t of radius formula$t$. \text{By contrast with} (49), the integration here iscentered at x. This is the well-known Kirchhoff with respect to the physical variablest and x only. It is instructive to compare these two formulas. Using the Plancherel identity it is very easy to deduce from (49) the L2 bound|u(t$, x)|2 dx ⩽ C (u0()2){L}2 ( R 3 )$, \text{while the possibility of obtaining such a bound from} R3 (50) \text{seems unlikely since the formula involves a deriva} - tive. \text{On the other hand}, (50) \text{is perfect for giving us information about the domain of influence}. Indeed, \text{we can see immediately from the formula that ifoutside the ball} B = {|x - x | ⩽ a}, then uu(t, x)0 is zerois zero outside the balla (Ba)+(|t)| for any time0 t. This fact does not seem at all transparent in the Fourier-based formula (49). The fact that different representations of solutions have different, even opposite, strengths and weaknesses has important consequences for con-structing approximate solutions, or parametrices, for more complicated equations, such as linear equations with variable coefficients or nonlinear wave equations.There are two possible types of constructions: those in physical space, which mimic the physical-space for-mula (50), and those in Fourier space, \text{which mimic the formula} (49).

3.3 A Priori Estimates

Most equations cannot be solved explicitly. However, if we are interested in qualitative information about a solution, then it is not necessary to derive it from anexact formula. But how else, one might wonder, can we

extract such information? A priori estimates are a very important technique for doing this. maximum principle simplest example of the first type is the following iden-The best-known examples are, and monotonicity arguments energy estimates. The, the tity (which is a very simple example of a so-called Bochner-type identity): The left-hand side is shorthand for R d |\partial2 u(x)|2 dx = R d |\Delta u(x)|2 dx.|\partial i\partial ju(x)|2 dx$R$ d1⩽i, j⩽d

and the identity holds for all functions twice continuously differentiable and tend to zero asu that are|x| → \infty. This formula can be justified fairly simply by integrating by parts. As a consequence of the bochner identity, we obtain the a priori estimate that ifu is a smooth solution to the Poisson equation (6) with square-integrable dataf, and if it tends to zero at infinity, then the square integral of its second derivatives isbounded: Thus we obtain the qualitative fact that, on average(in a mean-square sense), R$d |\partial^{2}u(x)|^{2} dx ⩽^{R}^{d}u|f (x)$has “two more degrees$|^{2} dx < \i\text{nf ty}$.

Such identities playa major role in the theory of geometric PDEs on these manifolds.Energy-type identities and estimates also exist for parabolic, dispersive, and hyperbolic PDEs. For in-stance, they play a fundamental role in demonstrating the local existence, uniqueness, and finite speedof propagation for hyperbolic PDEs with smooth initial data. Energy estimates become particularly powerful when combined with inequalities such as the Sobolev embedding inequality , which allows one to convert version, is that the1 11. A crucial fact, about which one can read more in the online$< p < \i\text{nf ty}$, or Hölder-type norms. The first case corresponds L2-norms in (51) can be replaced by Lp-norms, to Schauder estimates Calderon–Zygmund estimates. Both are extremely important in the study of, while the second corresponds to regularity properties for solutions to second-order elliptic PDEs.

The following theorem is the simplest manifestation of it.

The history of how this choice was made is a fascinating one.

In particular, the Dirichlet normv belongs to this space. In fact, Riemann chosev Dris finite when X =C2(D) ̄ (a similar space but designed for twice continuously differentiable functions). This bold but flawed attempt was followed by a penetrating criticism by weierstrass does not have to achieve its minimum in either[VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), who showed that the functional$C2(D)$ ̄ or$C^{1}(D)$ ̄ . However, Riemann’s basic idea was revived, and it eventually triumphed after a long and inspir-ing process that involved defining appropriate function spaces, introducing the notion of generalized solutions, and developing a regularity theory for them. (The precise formulation of the Dirichlet principle also requires the definition of sobolev spaces [III.29 §2.4](/part-03/function-spaces).) been vastly extended so that it can be applied to a large class of linear Let us briefly summarize the method, which has since13 and nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. It is based on two steps. In the first step one applies a minimization procedure. Although, as Weierstrass discovered, the natural function spaces may not contain functions that achieve the minimum, one canuse such a procedure to find a generalized solution instead. This may not seem very interesting, since wewere looking for a function that solves the Dirichlet problem (or one of the other problems to which themethod can be applied). But this is where the second step comes in: it is sometimes possible to show that the generalized solution must in fact be a classical solu-tion (that is, an appropriately smooth function) after all. This is the “regularity theory” mentioned earlier.In some situations, however, the generalized solution may turn out to have singularities and therefore notbe regular. Then the challenge is to understand the

nature of these singularities and to prove realistic ti al regularity results. For instance, it is sometimes pos-parsible to prove that the generalized solution is smooth every where apart from in a small “exceptional set.”Though generalized solutions are at their most effective for elliptic problems, their range of applicability encompasses all PDEs. For example, we have already seen that the fundamental solutions to the basic linear equations have to be interpreted as distributions, which are examples of generalized solutions. successful for nonlinear evolution problems, such assystems of conservation laws in one space dimension.The notion of generalized solutions has also proved An excellent example is provided by the Burgers equa-tion (21). As we have seen, solutions to$\partial u + u\partial u =$ 0 develop singularities in finite time no matter howsmooth the initial conditions are. It is natural to ask$t^{x}$ whether solutions continue to make sense, as general-ized solutions, even beyond the time when these singularities form. A natural notion of generalized solutionis a function$u$ \text{such that}(∂tu + u∂x u)φ = 0

for every smooth function bounded set, since one can make sense of the integral R1+1 φ \text{that is zero outside a} even whening this by parts (the first term with respect touis not a differentiable function. Integrat-t and the second with respect to formulation: x) one obtains the following It can be shown that, under additional conditions called R1+1 u\partial tφ + 1(2 R()1)+1 u2\partial xφ = 0 ∀φ \in C0 \i\text{nf ty} ((R1)+1). entropy conditions admits a unique generalized solution that is, the IVP for the Burgers equation global: that is, valid for everyt \in  R. Today we have a satis- factory theory of global solutions to a large class of hyperbolic systems of one-dimensional “conservation laws.” These systems, for which the above-mentioned theory applies, are called strictly hyperbolic. the question of what constitutes a good concept ofa generalized solution, though fundamental, is far For more complicated nonlinear evolution equations, murkier. For higher-dimensional evolution equations the first concept of a weak solution was introduced by Leray. Let us call a generalized solution not prove any type of uniqueness for it. This unsatisfac-weak if one cantory situation may be temporary, i.e., the result of our technical inabilities, or unavoidable, in the sense that the concept itself is flawed. Leray was able to produce, by a compactness method, a weak solution of the IVP

IV.12. Partial Differential Equations

for the advantage of the compactness method (and its mod-navier–stokes equations [III.23](/part-03/the-euler-and-navierstokes-equations). The great ern extensions, which can, in some cases, cleverly cir-cumvent lack of compactness) is that it produces global solutions for all data. This is particularly important for supercritical or critical nonlinear evolution equations, which we will discuss later. For these we expect clas-sical solutions to develop singularities in a finite time. The problem, however, is that one has very little con-trol over such solutions. In particular, we do not know how to prove their uniqueness.14 Similar types of solutions were later introduced for other important non-linear evolution equations. In most of the interesting cases of supercritical evolution equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, the usefulness of the types of weak solutions discovered so far remains undecided.

3.6 Microlocal Analysis, Parametrices, and

para differential Calculus

One of the fundamental difficulties of hyperbolic and dispersive equations is the interplay between geometric properties, which concern the physical space, and other properties, intimately tied to oscillations, that arebest seen in Fourier space. Microlocal analysis is a general still-developing philosophy according to which one isolates the main difficulties by careful localizations in physical space or Fourier space or both. An important application of this point of view is the construction of parametrices for linear hyperbolic equations and their use in proving results about the propagation of singu-larities. Parametrices, as we have already mentioned, are approximate solutions of linear equations with vari-able coefficients, with error terms that are smoother. Thelocal analysis to nonlinear equations.

3.7 Scaling Properties of Nonlinear Equations

A PDE is said to have arescales a solution in an appropriate way, one obtains scaling property if, whenever one another solution. Essentially, all basic nonlinear equa-tions have well-defined scaling properties. Take, for example, the Burgers equation (21),\partial tu + u\partial xu = 0. If other researchers after him, he was unable to prove uniqueness ofhis weak solution, he managed to show that it must coincide with a14. Leray was very concerned about this point. Though, like all classical one as long as the latter does not develop singularities.

uu is a solution of this equation, then so is the function defined byu (t, x) = u(\lambda t, \lambda x). Similarly, if u is a solution of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation in R$d^{λ}$,λ$i$∂ u + Δu + c|u|2 u = 0, (54)t

4.1 Variational Equations

There is a general and extremely effective method for generating equations with prescribed symmetries that plays a fundamental role in both physics and geometry.One starts with a scalar quantity, called a Lagrangian, such as $L[φ] =^{\mu}$,ν3=0 mμν ∂μφ∂νφ - V (φ)$, (55) with$φa real-valued function defined on R1$+3 and V$ some real function of$φ^{3}$. Here ∂ denotes the partial derivatives with respectφ such as, for example, V (φ) = to the coordinates as earlier, denotes the 4\mu x^μ, μ\times =4 diagonal matrix with diago-0, 1, 2, 3, and m^μν = m^μν, nal entries(-1, 1, 1, 1), associated with the Minkowski diagletting16. This is done by starting with the Minkowski metric(-1 c/c→$\i\text{nf ty}$2, 1.,1,1), where c corresponds to the velocity of light, andm =

metric. We associate with L[φ] the so-called action integral: S[φ] =R 3 +1 L[φ].

Notice that both L[φ] and S[φ] are invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. In other words, if$T$: R1+3 \to  (R1)+3 is a function that does not change the metric and we define a new function byψ(t$, x) = φ(T (t, x))$, then L[φ] = L[ψ] and S[φ] =S[ψ].

From this we wish to deduce that the derivative of We shall consider a function S at φ, in some appropriate sense, is zero,φ that minimizes the and hence to deduce other properties aboutφis a function that lives in an infinite-dimensionalφ.

In view of the action principle and the arbitrariness ofφ ̇ we infer that$φ \text{must satisfy equation} (56)$. Thus (56) is indeed the Euler–Lagrange equation associated withthe Lagrangian$L[φ] = m^{\mu}\nu\partial φ\partial φ - V (φ)$. One can similarly show that the Maxwell equations$\mu^{\nu}$ of ele ct ro magnetism—along with their beautiful exten-sions to the Yang–Mills equations, wave maps, and the Einstein equations of general relativity—are also variational. That is, they too can be derived from a Lagrangian.

sponds a conservation law for the associated Euler–Lagrange PDE. Examples of such conservation laws are the familiar laws of conservation of energy, conservation ofmomentum, and conservation of angular momentum, all of which have important physical meaning. (The one-parameter group of symmetries for energy, for example, is just translations in time.) In the case of equation(56), the law of conservation of energy takes the form

$E(t) = E(0)$, (57)

We say that the energy identity (57) ismeans that it leads to an absolute bound on all solu-coercive, which tions with finite initial energy.

4.2 The Issue of Criticality

For the most basic evolution equations of mathematical physics, there are typically no better a priori estimates known than those provided by the energy. Taking into account the scaling properties of the corresponding equations as well, one is led to the very important classification of our basic equations, mentioned earlier, intosee how this is done, consider again the nonlinear subcritical, critical, and supercritical equations. To scalar equationbe(1/(p + 1))|φ|^pφ^+^1-. Recall that the energy integral is V^ (φ) = 0, and take V (φ) to$\text{given by} (58)$. If we assign to the spacetime variables the dimension of length, have dimension L-1 and therefore L, then the spacetime derivatives has the dimension ofsides of the equation$L^{-2}$. To be able to balance the left- and right-handφ = |φ|p^-1φ, we need to assign a length scale toφ; we find this to be$L2^{/}(1^{-}p)$. Thus the energy integral, $E(t) =^{R}^{d}(2^{-1}|\partialφ|^{2} + |φ(|^{p})^{+1}) dx$,

has the dimension responding to the volume element d$L^{c}$, c = d-2+(4/(1 x-p))= d, withx1 dxd2 cor-· · · ds ub critical$x^{d}$, which scales likeif c < 0, critical Ld. We say that the equation isif c = 0, and supercritical$if$ c > 0. Thus, for example, φ - φ5 = 0 is critical in dimensiond = 3. The same sort of dimensional analy- sis can be done for all our other basic equations. an evolutionary PDE is said to be regular if all smooth finite-energy initial conditions lead to global smooth solutions. It is conjectured that all subcritical equations are regular, but one expects supercritical equa-tions to develop singularities. Critical equations are important borderline cases. The heuristic reason for this is that the nonlinearity tends to produce singu-larities while the coercive estimates prevent it. In subcritical equations the coercive estimates are stronger, while for supercritical equations it is the nonlinearity that is stronger. However, there may be other, more subtle a priori estimates that are not accounted for byour crude heuristic argument. Thus, some supercritical equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, maystill be regular.

4.3 Other Equations

Many other familiar equations can be derived fromthe variational ones described above by the following procedures.

4.3.1 Symmetry Reductions

Sometimes a PDE is very hard to solve but becomes much easier if one places additional symmetry constraints on solutions. For example, if the PDE is rota-tion invariant and we look just for rotation-invariant solutionsas functions ofu(t, x)t , then we can regard these solutions and r = |x|, effectively reducing the dimension of the problem. By this procedure of symmetry reductionis much simpler than the original one. Another, some-one can then derive a new PDE that what more general, way of obtaining simpler equationsis to look for solutions that satisfy some further property. For instance, one can assume that they are stationary (that is, that they do not depend on the time vari-able), spherically symmetric, self-similar (which means thatu(t$, x) \text{depends only on} x/t^{a})$, or traveling waves (which means thatu(t, x) depends only on x - vt for some fixed velocity vector obtained by such reductions have a variational struc-v).

For this reason, simplified model problems are also essential If it is well chosen, a model equation can lead to in the day-to-day work of the rigorous researcher into PDEs, who tests ideas on carefully selected model problems. It is crucial to emphasize that good results con-cerning the basic physical equations are rare; a very large percentage of important rigorous work in PDEsdeals with simplified equations selected, for technical reasons, to isolate and focus our attention on some specific difficulties present in the basic equations. sive equations These are in fact not variational, and therefore do In the above discussion we have not mentioned diffu-19 such as the Navier–Stokes equations. not quite fit into the above description.

Diffusive equations can often be interpreted as the gradient flow for an associ-ated elliptic variational problem. They can be used to construct nontrivial stationary solutions to the corre-sponding stationary systems, in the limit ast → $\i\text{nf ty}$, or to produce foliations with remarkable properties, such as one that was used recently in the proof of a famous conjecture of Penrose. As we have already mentioned, this idea has recently found an extraordinary applica-tion in the work of Perelman, who has used Ricci flow to settle the three-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. One such as energy, are not conserved and may in fact decrease in time.These are typically of parabolic type.19. That is, equations where some of the basic physical quantities,

of his main new ideas was to interpret Ricci flow as agradient flow.

4.4 Regularity or Breakdown

An additional source of unity for the subject of PDEsis the central role played by the problem of regularity or breakdown of solutions to the basic equations. It is intimately tied to the fundamental mathematical ques-tion of understanding what we actually mean by solutions and, from a physical point of view, to the issue of understanding the limits of validity of the corresponding physical theories. Thus, in the case of the burgers equation, for example, the problem of singularities can be tackled by extending our concept of solutions to accommodate shock waves, which are solutions that are discontinuous across certain curves in the In this case one can define a function space of general-(t, x)-space. ized solutions in which the IVP has unique, global solutions. Though the situation for more realistic physical systems is far less clear and far from being satisfactorily solved, the generally held opinion is that shock-wave-type singularities can be accommodated without breaking the boundaries of the physical theory at hand. The situation for singularities in general relativity isradically different. The singularities one expects there are such that no continuation of solutions is possible without altering the physical theory itself. The prevailing opinion here is that only a gravitational quantum field theory could achieve this. 5 General Conclusions What, then, is the modern theory of PDEs? As a first approximation, one could say that it is the pursuit ofthe following main goals. (i)equations of mathematical physics.Understand the problem of evolution for the basic The most pressing issue in this regard is to understand the local21 (with respect to time) smooth solutions of thewhen and how basic equations develop singularities criterion for distinguishing between regular theories.

thatical equations are not subcritical equations are regular and that supercrit-. Indeed, many subcritical equations have been proved to be regular even though welack a general procedure for establishing regularity results of this kind. The situation with supercritical equations is far more subtle. To start with, an equation that we now call supercritical22 may in fact turn out to be critical, or even subcritical, upon the discov-ery of additional a priori estimates. Thus an important question concerning the issue of criticality, and conse-quently that of singular behavior, is: are there other, stronger, local a priori bounds that cannot be derived from Noether’s principle? The discovery of such a bound would be a major event in both mathematics and physics. ties in our basic evolution equations is unavoidable, we Once we understand that the presence of singular i have to face the question of whether they can some-how be accommodated by a more general concept of what a solution is or whether their structure is suchthat the equation itself, indeed the physical theory that it underlies, becomes meaning less. An acceptable concept of a generalized solution should, of course, preserve the deterministic nature of the equations: inother words, it should be uniquely determined from its Cauchy data.Finally, once an acceptable concept of generalized solutions is found, we would like to use it to deter-mine some important qualitative features, such as longterm asymptotic behavior. One can formulate a limit-less number of such questions, the answers to which will vary from equation to equation. (ii)range of validity of various approximations.Understand in a rigorous mathematical fashion the The equations obtained by various limiting procedures or phe-no meno logical assumptions can of course be studied in their own right, as the examples that we have referred to above are. However, they present us with additional problems to do with the mechanics of howthey are derived from equations that we regard as more fundamental. It is entirely possible, for exam-ple, that the dynamics of a derived system of equations leads to behavior assumptions made in its derivation that is in compatible with the. Alternatively, a particular simplifying assumption, such as spherical sym-metry in general relativity or zero vorticity for compressible fluids, may turn out to be unstable at large coercive estimate available.22. What we call supercritical depends on the strongest a priori

These and other similar situations lead to important dilemmas: should we persist in studying the approximate equations even when, in many cases, we face formidable mathematical difficulties (some which may turn out to be quite pathological and are per-haps related to the nature of the approximation), \text{or should we abandon them in favor of the original system or a more suitable approximation}? \text{Whatever one mayfeel about this in any specific situation}, \text{it is clear that the problem of understanding}, rigorously, \text{the range of validity of various} \text{approximations} \text{is one of the fundamental goals in PDEs}.

However, it was Einstein’s profound insightpoincaré to elevate this invariance to the status of funda-mental physical principle, despite its in compatibility with what we now usually callwhich corresponds to takingc → $\i\text{nf ty}$ Galilean relativity in (3). A sur-, prising consequence of Lorentz invariance is that thenotion of simultaneity is not absolute but depends on the observer: given two distinct events that occur at(t$, x, y, z) and (t, x^ , y^ , z^ )$, it is easy to find a Lorentz transformation such that the transformed events nolonger have the samet-coordinate. ential equations known as theple It follows from a celebrated result in partial differ-, applied to (4), that \text{electromagnetic} \text{disturbances instrong Huygens princi vacuum propagate with speedtify as the speed of light}. \text{In view of Lorentz invariance}, c, \text{which we thus iden}- \text{this statement is independent of the frame}!

(6) The Lorentz transformations constitute precisely the symmetry group of the geometry defined by (5). Einstein’s principle of relativity could now be understood as the principle that the fundamental equations of physics must refer to space-time only through geometric quantities: that is, quantities that can be defined purely in terms of the metric. For example, from this point of view the reason that the notion of absolute simultaneity is not allowed is that it depends on a privileged hyperplane through any given point of R3+1. \text{But there are Lorentz} \text{transformations} \text{that preserve the metric and send this hyperplane to another one through the given point}, \text{so nothing in the metric can pick out one particular hyperplane}. \text{Note that if a physi}-\text{cal theory makes use of geometric quantities only}, \text{then it is automatically invariant under Lorentz} \text{transformations}: \text{this observation renders many complicated calculations unnecessary}. \text{Note that nonzero vectors the inner product Let us explore this geometric point of view further}.· , · \text{into three types}, calledv\text{are naturally classified bytimelike}0, , vnull, v =, and0, \text{or space li kev}, v, \text{according to whether}> 0, respectively.

Indeed, even Einstein initially rejected Minkowski space-time, pre-ferring to retain the independent reality of a definite “space,” albeit a space with a relative notion of simul-taneity. Only as a result of his search for general relativity did he realize that this view is fundamentally untenable. We shall return to this in section 3. 2 Relativistic Dynamics and the unification of Energy, Momentum, and Stress Besides the space-time concept and its geometriza-tion, the principle of relativity led to a profound rearrangement and unification of the fundamental con-cepts of dynamics: mass, energy, and momentum. Einstein’s celebrated relation between mass and energy inthe rest frame,

$E0 = mc2$, (8)

is the best-known expression of one aspect of this unifi-cation. This relation arises naturally when one attempts

to generalize Newton’s second law$m(dv/dt) = f \text{to a}$ relation between 4-vectors in Minkowski space. fields standing it, let us look at continuous media. Now, General relativity has to be formulated in terms ofrather than particles. As a first step toward under instead of particles we consider fic at i on of dynamical concepts encompasses what ismatter fields; the uniknown asied by the so-called stress, and its complete expression is embod-stress–energy–momentum tensor T . This tensor is fundamental to general relativity, so wehave no choice but to familiarize ourselves with it. It will be the key to the form of the Einstein equations (1)as well as to the object on their right-hand side. For each point$q \in (R3)+1$, the stress–energy–momentum tensor field T gives us a map T$: R4$ q \times (R4)q \to R (9)

By (R4)q we mean the$\text{often identify} R4 with R4$ q, but it will be important to dis- tinguish between the two when considering arbitrary coordinates in section 3.2.) Bilinear maps of the form (9) are known as covariant 2-tensors. known as agiven by If the only matter present is described by what isperfect fluid, then the components of$T are T00 = (ρ + p)u0u0 - p$, (T0)i = (ρ + p)uiu0$, Tij = (ρ + p)uiuj + pδij$,

Finally, observe that Tij with stress. These notions are clearly frame-T (u, u) = ρc2. This is the field-theoretic version of the famous equation (8).In general, T is derived from the totality of all the matter fields by constitutive functions that dependon the nature of the matter fields and their interactions. We need not worry here about such things. But, regard less of the nature of the matter fields involved, we always postulate that the following equations are satisfied:

$-\partial^{0}(T^{0})^{α} +^{3} \partial^{i}T^{i}α = 0$.i=1 486 \text{defining stein summation convention}$\nabla0 = −\partial0$, \nablai = ∂i, under which summation, and introducing the Ein- is implicit when an index appears both upstairs and downstairs, we may rewrite this as

3.1 The Equivalence Principle

Einstein understood as early as 1907 that the most pro-found aspect of the gravitational force could not be described within the relativity principle as he had for-mulated it in 1905. This aspect is what he called the equivalence principle. ciple is that of the “test particle” with velocitya fixed gravitational field The easiest setting in which to understand this prin-φ. In this case, we have thatv(t) in the classical gravitational force is given by$f = −m \nabla φ$, and we may rewrite Newton’s second law$m(dv/dt) =f as$

d$v= −∇φ$. (12) d$t$

IV. Branches of Mathematics

Notice that the mass gravitational field accelerates all objects at a given posi-$m$has dropped out! Thus, the tion in the same way. This explains the fact, recorded already in late antiquity by Ioannes Philoponus and popularized in Western Europe by Galileo, that thetime it takes objects to fall from a given height is independent of their weight.It was Einstein who first interpreted this property as a sort of covariance with respect to transformations toinstance, in the case of a constant gravitational field, noninertial, that is to say accelerated, frames. For which corresponds to the case$φ(z) = f z$, \text{we can pass} to the accelerated frame

$z$ ̃$= z +^{1}^{2}f t^{2}$

and write (12) as

d$v = 0$. (13)

Similarly, one can reverse the argument to “simulate” a gravitational field when none is present by expressingd$t$ (13) in an accelerated frame.

3.2 Vectors, Tensors, and Equations in

General Coordinates

Exactly what the equivalence principle means in gen-eral is somewhat obscure and has been the subject of debate ever since Einstein introduced it. Neverthe-less, the above considerations suggest that, even in the absence of gravity, it would be useful to know how various objects and equations appear when expressedin arbitrary coordinate systems. That is to say, let us change from our Minkowski coordinates$x^{0}$, x1$, x2$, x3 to the most general coordinate system, which we shall write a$\bar{s}x^{\mu}^ ̄ = x$ ̄$\mu^ ̄(x0$, x1, x2$, x3)$, wher\bar{e}\mu \text{ranges over} 0, 1, 2, 3.Expressing scalar functions in arbitrary coordinates poses no problem. But what about vector fields? Ifis a vector field expressed in Minkowski coordinates$v$ as coordinate$\bar{s}(v^{0}$, v1$, vx2$, v^ ̄^μ?3), how do we express v in our new allytor field One has to think a bit about what a vector field actu-is. The correct point of view is to consider a vec-$v$as a first-order differential operator defined (using Einstein’s summation convention) byvμ∂ f . So we seek vμ^ ̄ such that v(f ) = vμ^ ̄∂ fv(f )for all= functions\mu f. The chain rule then gives us our answer:$\mu^ ̄v^{\mu}^ ̄ = \partial \1artialxx$ ̄ ̄$\mu^{\nu} v^{\nu}$. (14)

mentum tensor What about tensors, such as the stress–energy–mo-T? In view of the definition (9), \text{we seek IV}.13. \text{General Relativity and the Einstein Equations} T\mu^ ̄^ ̄\nu \text{such that} T (u, v) = T\mu^ ̄^ ̄\nuu\mu^ ̄v^ ̄\nu, (15) \text{where the numbers respect to the coordinate}\bar{s}u\mu^ ̄ \text{are the components ofx}\mu^ ̄ \text{as we have just calculatedu with them above}. (\text{Note that these components depend onthe pointq}. \text{This is why it is now essential to distinguish} R4$q$ from R4.) Again, \text{the chain rule gives us the answer}: T^ ̄\mu \nu^ ̄ = T\mu\nu \partial x\partial\bar{x}$\nu^ ̄\nu \partial x\partial x ̄$\mu\mu^ ̄. Classically, we write  T = T\mu^ ̄\nu^ ̄\bar{d}x\mu^ ̄\bar{d}x\nu^ ̄ = T\mu\nu dx\mu dx\nu. One can interpret the above as a shorthand notation for(15), but it also tells us how to compute$T$ from Tμ^ ̄^ ̄ν μν

by formally applying the chain rule to $\bar{d}x^{\mu}^ ̄$. sides There is another covariant symmetric 2-tensor be-T that is relevant here. This is the Minkowski met- ric itself. Indeed, the classical form of the minkowski metric (5) corresponds to the representation

η\mu\nu dx\mu dx\nu,

where chain rule.ημ^ ̄ν^ ̄ is computed by formal application of the tion such as (10) into general coordinates, then the components of It is clear that if one tries to transform an equa-η and their derivatives will appear in the equations. Einstein (always thinking “algebraically”) was seeking laws of motion for both matter and the gravitational field that would have the same form in all coordinate systems. As he understood it, this meantthat all objects that appear should transform as tensors and should be considered a priori “unknown.” Hereferred to this principle as “general covariance.” This suggests that metric 2-tensor. Let us call this 2-tensorη should be replaced by an unknowng. One can ofsym- course try to write down an equation for the “unknown”$g$that forces it to be the “known” Minkowski metricη. Thus, “general covariance” per se does not force one toabandonη. But in view of the fact that g and T have the same number of components, it was a natural stepto considerg as the embodiment of the gravitational field and to try to look for an equation that related and T directly. In this way, the framework of generalg relativity was born.

3.3 Lorentzian Geometry

The profound insight of replacing the fixed Minkowskiη with a dynamic g brought Einstein to what we now callalizes Minkowski geometry following the blueprint of Lorentzian geometry. Lorentzian geometry gener riemann [VI.49]. That is, we replace the Minkowski metricη by a general mapg$: R4$ q \times  (R4)q \to  R.

In other words, we replace2-tensor, which is expressed in arbitrary coordinatesη by a symmetric covariantx^\mu byg^μν dx^\mu dx^ν.

Moreover, we require that at each pointear formg(· , ·) can be diagonalized to the Minkowskiq the bilin-$form (6)$. Loosely speaking, a Lorentzian metric is onethat “looks locally like the Minkowski metric,” just as a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) looks locally like the Euclidean metric. Just as with the Minkowski metric, the bilinear form gas permits us to classify nonzero vectors timelike, null, or spacelike and to define proper timesvq at a point q \text{of world linesthe formula} (7), but with$γ(s) = (x0γ$ ̇(s), x, γ$̇ \text{replaced by}1$(s)$, x^{2}(s)$, xg3(s))x ̇\mu x ̇byν . It is in this sense that we can speak of the geometryμν$of$ g. In view of Minkowski’s formulation of the special relativity principle as the statement that the equationsof physics refer to space-time only through geometric quantities associated with the Minkowski metric, itis natural to look for a generalization of this principle, and indeed a suitable version immediately suggests itself. It is the principle thatrefer to the space-time coordinates only via geometric the equations of physics quantities naturally associated withg. “test particles,” as formulated geometrically for the We saw earlier that the kinematic constraint on Minkowski metric, was that dthis makes sense for an arbitrary Lorentzian metric.γ/dsshould be timelike; But how does one formulate differential equations? For instance, how does one formulate an analogue of (10) that refers only to$g$? natural geometric concepts suitable for the task had It turned out that in the Riemannian case, a set of already been developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by Riemann, Bianchi, Christoffel, Ricci, and Levi-Civita. These carry over directly to the Lorentzian case.

bols One begins by defining the so-calledΓμνλ \text{by Christoffel sym}Γμνλ =1 2 gλρ(∂\mu gρν + ∂νgμρ - ∂ρgμν ). Here, the numbersgμν are the components of the “inverse metric” oftion to the equation$g$: that is, they are the unique solu-$g^{\mu}\nu g = δ^{\mu}$, where, as usual,δμ λ = 1 if λ = \mu and 0 otherwise. (It turns out thatνλ\lambda gμν is very useful for the calculational gymnastics that are typical of tensor analysis when it exploits the einstein summation convention.) One can then define a differential operator$\nabla^{\mu} called$ a connection, which acts on vector fields by \nabla\mu vν = ∂\mu vν + Γμλν vλ (16) and on covariant 2-tensors by \nabla\lambda T\mu\nu = \partial\lambda T\mu\nu - Γλ\muσ Tσ \nu - Γλ\nuσ T\muσ. (17) The left-hand sides of (16) and (17) define tensors that can be expressed in any coordinate system by a formal application of the chain rule. With the help of this differential operator, one could now write the analogue of equations (10) for an arbi-trary metric g as \nabla\mu T\mu\nu = 0, (18)

wherewithg.\nablaμ = gμν\nablaν refers to the connection associated If we consider a limit as the matter field becomes concentrated at a point, or rather as the stress–energy–momentum tensor T is nonzero only on a world line, then this curve will be aμν geodesic of g: that is, a curve that locally maximizes the proper time defined byg. These are the analogues of straight timelike lines in Minkowski space. In this limit, the motion of thematter does not depend on the nature of the stressenergy–momentum tensor, but only on the geometry of the metric that defines geodesics. Thus, all objects fall in the same way. These considerations give a concrete realization to the equivalence principle in general relativity. Finally, it is important to remark that for a general metric vation laws (11) for “total energy” and “total momen-g, the identity (18) does not imply global conser- tum.” Such laws hold only ifg has symmetries. The fact that the fundamental conservation laws survive ingeneral only at the infinitesimal level is an important insight into the nature of these principles in physics.

3.4 Curvature and the Einstein Equations

It remains, then, to give a set of equations for the metric gwe expect these equations to be second order, and wethat relate it to T . In anticipation of a Newtonian limit, expect them to implement “general covariance” in the simplest way possible: they should refer to no other structure butg itself and T . tensorial objects that are invariantly associated with One can define the Again, Riemannian geometry provides ready-made Riemann curvature tensor$g$.Rμνλρ dx\mu dxν dx\lambda dxρ

with components given by

 R\mu\nuλρ = g\muσ (\partialρΓ\nuλσ - \partialλΓ\nuρσ + Γ\nuλτ Γτρσ - Γ\nuρτ Γτλσ ). One can also define the Ricci curvature

 R\mu\nu dx\mu dx\nu,

a covariant symmetric 2-tensor with components givenby R\mu\nu = gλρR\mu\nuλρ,

and the scalar curvature

$R = g^{\mu}\nuR^{\mu}\nu$.

Ifsurface ing were the induced (Riemannian) metric on a 2-R3, then R would just be twice the Gauss curvatureof as complicated tensorial generalizations of Gauss K. The above expressions should be thought curvature to several dimensions. the Einstein equations (1) is provided by the following constraint that Einstein demanded: whatever the equa-The final piece of the puzzle for the formulation of tion relating the metric and the stress–energy–momentum tensor of matter, (18) (the infinitesimal conser-vation of stress–energy–momentum) should hold as a consequence the so-called. Now, it turns out that for Bianchi identities imply thatany metricg,\nabla^μ(R^μν -^1^2 g^μνR) = 0. (19)

It is thus natural to postulate a linear relation between T and the tensor R -1 g R. The formμν R -1 μνg R2=μν8πGc-4 T (20)μν2 μνμν

Such coordinates always exist locally and they are tradi-tionally called harmonic coordinates, although the term wave coordinates would perhaps be more appropriate. The Einstein equation can then be written as a system

ggμν = Nμν ({gαβ}$, {\partial^{γ} g^{α}β})$,

wherein the N∂γ μνgαβis a nonlinear expression that is quadratic. In view of the Lorentzian signature of the metric, the above system constitutes what is knownas a second-order nonlinear (but quasilinear) hyperbolic system At this point, it is instructive to make a compari-. son with the Maxwell equations. Suppose we are given an electric field Minkowski space. A 4$E$and a magnetic field-potential is a vector field Bdefined on A such that(Here Ei = −=∂1, andi A0 - c-1∂tis totally antisymmetric, i.e., it Ai$, \text{and Bi} = 3 j$, k=1 ijk∂j Ak. transforms to its negative under permutation of anytwo indices.)

the Maxwell equations can be written

 A\mu = −c-2\partia(lt)2 A\mu + \partia(li)2 A\mu = 0, i

from which the wave properties are completely man-ifest. The gauge-symmetric point of view lived on to later twentieth century glory: thewhich are a nonlinear generalization of the Maxwell Yang–Mills equations, equations with a similar gauge symmetry, are the cen-tral part of the so-called standard model for particle physics.The hyperbolicity property of the Einstein equations has two important repercussions. The first is that there should exist gravitational waves. This was noted by Einstein at least as early as 1918, essentially as a result ofa linearized version of the considerations in the above discussion. The second is that there is ainitial value problem [IV.12 §2.4](/part-04/analysis) for the einstein well-posed equations (1) with the domain-of-dependence prop-erty, when these are coupled with appropriate matter equations. In particular, this is true in the vacuum case (21). \text{The proper conceptual framework to formulate the latter problem took a long time to get right}, \text{and was only completely understood through work of Choquet}-\text{Bruhat and Geroch in the} 1950 s and 1960 s, \text{based on the fundamental concept of global hyperbolicity could associate a unique solution} (\text{in the vacuum case}, \text{due to Leray}. Well-\text{posedness means that one a Lorentzian} 4 - manifold(M, g) satisfying (21)) \text{with a} suitable notion of initial data. Of course, “initial data”does not mean “data at time$t =$0,” since the concept of t = 0 is not geometric. Instead, the data take the form of some Riemannian 3-manifold covariant 2-tensor K. The triple(Σ,(Σ, g) ̄g, K) ̄with a symmetric has to satisfy the so-called notion, the fundamental problem of general relativity, Einstein constraint equations. But with this despite its revolutionary conceptual structure, is thor-oughly classical: to determine the relation of the solution to initial data, that is to say, to determine the future from knowledge of the “present.” This is the problemof dynamics. 4 The Dynamics of General Relativity In this final section we give a taste of our current math-ematical understanding of the dynamics of the Einstein equations.

4.1 Stability of Minkowski Space and the

Nonlinearity of Gravitational Radiation

In any physical theory in which one can formulate the problem of dynamics, the most basic question is the

IV.13. General Relativity and the Einstein Equations stability of the trivial solution. In other words, if wemake a small change to the “initial conditions,” will the resulting change to the solution be small as well? In thecase of general relativity, this is the question of stability of the Minkowski space-time R3$+1$. This fundamen- tal result was proven for the vacuum equations (21) in1993 by Christodoulou and Klainerman. it possible to formulate theation The proof of the stability of Minkowski space made rigorously. Gravitational radiation is yet to belaws of gravitational rad i observed directly, but it has been inferred, originally by Hulse and Taylor, from the energy loss of a binary system. This work gave them the only Nobel prize (1993) directly associated with the Einstein equations!The blueprint for the mathematical formulation of the radiation problem is based on work of Bondi and later Penrose. One associates with the space-time(M, g) an ideal boundary “at infinity,” known asdenoted$I^{+}$. Physically, the points ofnull infinity I+ correspond and to observers who are far away from the isolated self-gravitating system but who are receiving its signals. Gravitational radiation can be identified with certain tensors defined on I+ from rescaled boundary limits of various geometric quantities. As Christodoulou was todiscover, the laws of gravitational radiation are themselves nonlinear, and the nonlinearity is potentially relevant for observation.

4.2 Black Holes

Perhaps no prediction of general relativity is better known today than that of black holes.The story of black holes begins with the so-called Schwarzschild metric:

- 1 - 2 rm dt2 + 1 - 2 rm-1 dr2+ r2(dθ2 + \sin2 θ dφ2). (22) \text{The parametera solution of the vacuum Einstein equations} (21) \text{thatm here is a positive constant}. \text{This is was found in} 1916. \text{The original} \text{interpretation} of (22) \text{was that it modeled the gravitational field in a vacuum region outside a star}. \text{That is to say}, (22) \text{was considered only in some coordinate rangeand the metric was matched atr} > Rr = R0, \text{for anto a} “static” inte- R0 > 2 m, rior metric satisfying the coupled Einstein–Euler sys-tem in the coordinate range$r$ ⩽ R .

By a simple change of coordinates, one can easily extend the metric reg-ularly as a solution of (21) beyond r = 2 m. \text{That is}, there exists a manifold M that contains both a regionr >ular (null) hypersurface2 m and a region 0 < r <H+. The metric element (22)2 m, separated by a reg- is valid every where except on$H^{+}$, where it must be rewritten in regular coordinates.It turns out that the hypersurface$H^{+} \text{can be char}-$ acterized by an exceptional global property: it defines the boundary of the region of space-time that can send signals to null infinity$I^{+}$, or, in the physical interpreta- tion, to distant observers. In general, the set of points that cannot send signals to null infinity$I^{+} \text{is known}$ as the0< r <black hole2 m is the black hole region ofregion of space-time. Thus, the region M, and H+ is known as the These issues took a long time to be sorted out, event horizon. partly because the language of global Lorentzian geom-etry was developed long after the original formulation of the Einstein equations. The global geometry ofthe extended space-time$M$was clarified by Synge in around 1950 and finally by Kruskal in 1960. The name“black hole” is due to the imaginative physicist John Wheeler. From their beginnings as a theoretical curios-ity, black holes have become part of the accepted astrophysical explanation for a wide variety of phenomena, and in particular are thought to represent the end-state for the gravitational collapse of many stars.

4.3 Space-Time Singularities

A second natural problem poses itself in relation tothe Schwarzschild metric (22), now considered in the region happens at$r <r2 = m$0?of the extended space-time$M$: what scalar geometric invariant, it follows that, unlike the situation A computation reveals that as RμνλρRμνλρ blows up. Since this expression is ar \to  0, the Kretchmann$at$ r = 2 m, the space-time is not regularly extendable beyond 0. Moreover, timelike geodesics (freely falling observers in the test particle approximation) entering the black hole region reach$r =$0 in finite proper time, so they are “incomplete” in the sense that they cannot be continued indefinitely. They thus “observe” the breakdown of the geometry of the space-time metric. Moreover, macroscopic observers approaching$r = 0$ are torn apart by the gravitational “tidal forces.”

as well as reaction chemistry, population dynamics, and economics. Computer simulations and visualizations play an important role in the development of the theory; they have changed our views about what should be considered typical, rather than special and atypical. There are two main branches of dynamical systems: continuous and discrete. The main focus of this paperwill be holomorphic dynamics, which concerns discrete dynamical systems of a special kind. These systems are obtained by taking a[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)$f$defined on the complex numbers and apply-holomorphic function ing it repeatedly. An important example is whenf is a quadratic polynomial.

By neglecting the influence of other planets, Newton was able to solve the two-body problem exhe derived the laws formulated by Johannes Kepler, which describe how each planet moves in an elliptic orbit around the sun. However, the jump to N > 2 makes an enormous difference to the complication ofthe problem: except in very special cases, the system of equations can no longer be solved explicitly (see the three-body problem ton’s equations are of great practical importance when[V.33](/part-05/the-three-body-problem)).

And this is true: if the sequence does indeed converge toward that zero, and0 does so extremely quickly, basically doubling the num-ber of correct digits in each step. This rapid convergence makes Newton’s method very useful for numerical computations.

1.2 Continuous Dynamical Systems

We can think of atem of first-order differential equations, which deter-continuous dynamical system as a sysmine how the system evolves in time. A solution iscalled an orbit or trajectory, and is parametrized by a numbert, which one usually thinks of as time, that takes real values and varies continuously: hence thename “continuous” dynamical system. A periodic orbit of period T is a solution that repeats itself after time T, but not earlier.

The differential equationx^ (t) = −x(t) \text{is of sec}- ond order, but it is nevertheless a continuous dynamical system because it is equivalent to the system oftwo first-order differential equations$x^ (t) = x (t) andx^{2}(t) = −x^{1}(t)$. In a similar way, the system of differ-1 2 ential equations of theinto standard form by introducing new variables.

Thus, th(ei)2 i 3 N-body problem is a good example of a continuous dynamical system. ofthe form In general, if we have a dynamical system consistingn equations, then we can write the ith equation inxi^ (t) = fi(x1(t), . . . , xn(t)), or alternatively we can write all the equations at oncein the form$x^ (t) = f (x(t))$, where x(t) is the vec- torfrom$(x R^{1}(t)$, . . . , xn to Rn.

Poincaré \text{introduced the so}-\text{called restricted three}-\text{body problem}, \text{where the third body is assumed to have an infinitely small mass}: \text{it does not influence the motion of the other two bodies but it is} 495 \text{influenced by them}. Poincaré’s \text{work became the pre}-\text{lude to topological dynamics}, \text{which focuses on topological properties of solutions to dynamical systems andtakes a qualitative approach to them}. tem. A \text{periodic orbit is called Of special interest is the long}-\text{term behavior of a sys}-\text{stable if all orbits through points sufficiently close to it stay close to it at all future times}. \text{It is called} \text{asymptotically} \text{stable if all sufficiently close orbits approach it as time tends to infinity}. \text{Let us illustrate this by two linear examples in discrete dynamics}. \text{For the real function} F(x) = −x, \text{all points} \text{have a periodic orbit}: 0 \text{has period} 1 \text{and all other} xhave period 2. Every orbit is stable, but none is asymp-totically stable. The real function G(x) =1 x \text{has only}\text{one periodic orbit}, namely 0. \text{Sincehas period} 1, \text{and we call it a fixed point} G(0) =. \text{If you take}20, \text{this orbit any number and repeatedly divide it} 2, \text{then the result}-\text{ing sequence will approach} 0, \text{so the fixed point} 0 is \text{asymptotically} stable. \text{One of the methods introduced by Poincar}é \text{during his study of the three}-\text{body problem was a reduction from a continuous dynamical system}, \text{in dimensionn}, say, \text{to an associated discrete dynamical system}, \text{a map}-\text{ping in dimensionn} - 1. \text{The idea is as follows}.

For any point inΣthat is sufficiently close tox0, one0 can follow its orbit around and see where it next inter-sectsΣ. This defines a transformation, known as the Poincaré map, which takes the original point to the next point of intersection of its orbit withlows from the fact that dynamical systems have uniqueΣ.

1.5 Chaotic Behavior

The notion ofhas been used in different settings, and there is no sin-chaotic dynamics arose in the 1970 s. It gle definition that covers all uses of the term. However, the property that best characterizes chaos is the phe-nomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Poincaré was the first to observe sensitivity to initial conditions in his treatment of the three-body problem. Instead of describing his observations let us look at a much simpler example from discrete dynamics.Take as a dynamical space X the half-open unit inter- valber and reduces it modulo 1. That is,[0, 1), and let F be the function that doubles a num-F(x) = 2 x when0\text{be a number in}⩽ x <1 2 and F(x)X \text{and let its iterates be} = 2 x - 1 whe(n1)2 ⩽ x <x = 1.

In practical applications this is never the case. For instance, when applying a mathematical model to perform weather forecasts, onedoes not know the initial conditions exactly, and this is why reliable long-term forecasting is impossible.

strange attractors Sensitivity is also important in the notion of so-called. A set A is called an attractor if all orbits that start innearby points get closer and closer to A stay in A and if all orbits through A. In continuous systems, some simple sets that can be attractors are equilibrium points, periodic orbits (limit cycles), and surfaces such as a torus. In contrast to these examples, strange attractors have both complicated geometry and complicated dynamics: the geometry isdynamics sensitive. We shall see examples of fractals fractal and the later on. tractor The best-known strange attractor is the. In the early 1960 s, the meteorologist Edward N.Lorenz at Lorenz studied a three-dimensional continuous dynam-ical system that gave a simplified model of heat flow. While doing so, he noticed that if he restarted his com-puter with its initial conditions chosen as the output of an earlier calculation, then the trajectory started todiverge from the one he had previously observed. The explanation he found was that the computer used more precision in its internal calculations than it showed in its output. For this reason, it was not immediately apparent that the initial conditions were in fact very slightly different from before. Because the system was sensitive, this tiny difference eventually made a much bigger difference. He coined the poetic phrase “the but-terfly effect” to describe this phenomenon, suggesting that a small disturbance such as a butterfly flickering itswings could in time have a dramatic effect on the longterm evolution of the weather and trigger a to rna do thousands of miles away. Computer simulations of the Lorenz system indicate that solutions are attracted toa complicated set that “looks like” a strange attractor. The question of whether it actually was one remained open for a long time. It is not obvious how trustworthy computer simulations are when one is studying sensitive systems, since the computer rounds off the numbers in each step. In 1998 Warwick Tucker gavea computer-assisted proof that the Lorenz attractor is in fact a strange attractor. He usedmetic, where numbers are represented by intervals and interval a ri th estimates can be made precise. For topological reasons, sensitivity to initial conditions is possible for continuous dynamical systems only when the dimension is at least 3. For discrete systems where the mapmust be at least 2. However, for noninjective mappings, F is injective, the dimension sensitivity can occur for one-dimensional systems, aswe saw with the example given earlier. This is one of

the reasons that discrete one-dimensional dynamical systems have been intensively studied.

1.6 Structural Stability

Two dynamical systems are said to be equivalent if there is a homeomorphism (a continuous topologically map with continuous inverse) that maps the orbits of one system onto the orbits of the other, and vice versa.Roughly speaking, this means that there is a continuous change of variables that turns one system into theother. tem given by the real quadratic polynomial4 x(As an example, consider the discrete dynamical sys-1 - x). Suppose we were to make the substitution F(x) =y = −4 x + 2. How could we describe the system in\text{terms of}4 x(1 - x)y, which means that? Well, if we applyy F= −, then we change4 x+2 changes F(x)x to to-4 F(x) + 2 = −16 x(1 - x) + 2. But - 16 x(1 - x) + 2 = 16 x2 - 16 x + 2= (-4 x + 2)2 - 2 = y2 - 2.

functions? One answer arose in 1879, when Why might one be interested in iterating rational cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) had the idea of trying to find roots of complex polynomials by extending Newton’s method, which we discussed in the introduction, from real numbers tocomplex numbers. Given any polynomial P , the corre- sponding Newton function given by the formula NP \text{is a rational function}$, NP (z) = z - PP (z)^ (z) = z P^ (z)P^ (z)- P (z)$. To apply Newton’s method, one iterates this rational function. The study of the iteration of rational functions flourished at the beginning of the twentieth century, thanks in particular to work of Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia (who independently obtained many of the same results). \text{Part of their work concerned the studyof the local behavior of functions in the neighborhoods of a fixed point}. \text{But they were also concerned about global dynamical properties and were inspired by the theory of so}-\text{called li shed by Paul Montel}.

The dynamics of the simplest quadratic polynomial,$Q (z) = z2$, plays a fundamental role in the under- standing of the dynamics of any quadratic polyno-mial. Moreover, the dynamical behavior of0 Q can be analyzed and understood completely.Ifz = r ei^θ, then z2 = r2 e2 i^θ, so squaring a complex number squares its modulus and doubles its argument.Therefore, the unit circle (the set of complex numbers of modulus 1) is mapped byof radiusr < 1 is mapped onto a circle closer to the Q0 to itself, while a circle origin, and a circle of radius$r > 1 \text{is mapped onto a}$ circle farther away.

In order to deter- mine which ones, we first notice that the only possi-bility outside the unit circle is the fixed point at the origin, since all other points, when you repeatedly square them, either get steadily closer and closer to the ori-gin, or get steadily farther and farther away. So now let us look at the unit circle, and consider the pointe2$π^{i}^{θ}^{0}$, with modified argumentθ . If this point is peri- odic with period that is,(2 k - 1)θ kmust be an integer. Because of this,, we must have (20)kθ0 = θ0(mod 1): it is convenient to parametrize a point on the unit circleby its modified argument.

as we shall see later, critical orbits play an essential role in the analysis of the global dynamics. In the fam-ily of polynomials F the parameter \lambda is equal to the multiplier of the fixed point at the origin of$\lambda F^{λ}$, which sometimes makes this family more convenient.

2.4 The Riemann Sphere

To understand further the dynamics of polynomials it is best to regard them as a special case of rational functions. Since a rational function can sometimes be infinite, the natural space to consider is not the com-plex plane C but the extended complex plane, which is the complex plane together with the point “space is denoted ˆC= C ∪ {$\i\text{nf ty}$}. A \text{geometrical picture}\infty.” This (see figure 1) is obtained by identifying the extended complex plane with the Riemann sphere. This is simply the unit sphere\\{(x1}$, x2$, x3)$:\\$(x2)1 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 = 1 \text{in three}-\text{dimensional space}. Given a number complex plane, the straight line joiningz to the northz in the pole N = (0, 0, 1) intersects this sphere in exactly one place (apart from N itself). This place is the point in the sphere that is associated with bigger|z| is, the closer the associated point is toz. Notice that the N. We therefore regard Let us now think of N as corresponding to the point Q (z) = z2 as a function from\infty . ˆC to ˆC. We have seen that 0 is a super-attracting fixed0 point ofwell? The classification we gave in terms of multipliers$Q^{0}$. What about \infty, which is a fixed point as does not work attion is to “move”\infty \infty to 0. If one wishes to understand the, but a standard trick in this situa- behavior of a function look instead at the function fwith a fixed point atg(z) = 1/f (1/z)\infty , one can, which has a fixed point at 0 (since 11$/$\infty$= 0)$. When f (z) = z2, g(z)/f (1 is also/0) =z12/f (, so\infty \infty ) =is also a super-attracting fixed point of$Q^{0}.

For all such polynoit follows that the plane is split into two disjoint setswith qualitatively different dynamics, one consisting of points that are attracted to\infty  and the other consist- ing of points that are not.

2.6 Properties of Julia Sets

In this section we shall list several common properties of Julia sets. The proofs of these, which are beyond the scope of this article, mostly depend on the theory of normal families. • The Julia set is the set of points for which the system displays sensitivity to initial conditions, i.e., the chaotic subset of the dynamical system.

502

• The repelling orbits belong to the Julia set and form a dense subset of the set. That is, any point in the Julia set can be approximated arbitrarily wellby a repelling point. This is the definition originally used by Julia. (Of course, the name “Julia set”was used only later.) • For any point"\infty z in the Julia set, the set of iterated-k preimages the Julia set. This property is used when one isk=1 F (z) forms a dense subset of• making computer pictures of Julia sets.In fact, for any point zin ˆC (with at most one or two exceptions), the closure of the set of iterated preimages contains the Julia set. • For any pointhood U of z, the iterated imagesz in the Julia set and any neighbor-Fk(U ) cover all of ˆThis property demonstrates an extreme sensitivity C except at most one or two exceptional points.zz• to initial conditions.Ifpletely invariant (that is,Ω is a union of Fatou components that is com-F(Ω) = Ω = F-1(Ω)), then the boundary ofset.

Compare also with figure 2, where the attracting basins ofof such completely invariant sets.(Q3()c)0 and (Ac)0(\infty ) are examples• The Julia set is either connected or consists of un- countably many connected components. An exam-ple of the latter is shown in figure 6. •The Julia set is typically a fractal: when one zooms in on it, one finds that the complication of the setis repeated at all scales. It is also self-similar, in the following sense: for any noncritical pointz in the Julia set, any sufficiently small neighborhood ofz \text{is mapped bijectively onto} F(Uz), a neighbor-Uz hood ofin F(U )F(z)look alike..

More generally, for all monic polynomials P (i.e., poly- nomials with leading coefficient 1) there is a unique holomorphic change of variablesφP that converts P into the function sense thatφ (P (z))z \to = zφd (z)\text{for large enough}d, and has the propertyz, in the PP$503 thatwritten$(φPψ(z)/z)$. \to 1 as z →$\infty. \text{The inverse of} φP is P

2.7.2 Potentials

As we have noted already, if one repeatedly squares a complex numberit will escape to infinity. The larger the modulus ofz of modulus greater than 1, thenz, the faster the iterates will tend to infinity. If insteadof squaring, one applies a monic polynomial P of degree that the iteratesd, then for large enoughz, P (z)$, P^{2}(z)$, . . . ztend to infinity. Itit is again true follows from the formula$φ (P^{k}(z)) = φ (z()^{d})^{k}$. Therefore, the speed at whichφP (P (z)) = φP (z)d that the iterates tend to infinity depends not onon P |φ (z)|: the larger the value of P |φ (z)|, the faster|z| but the convergence. For this reason, the level sets of$P^{P} |φ |$, P

A set which is compact, totally disconnected, and with no isolated points iscalled a cantor set [III.17](/part-03/dimension), since such a set is homeomorphic to Cantor’s middle-thirds set. Note that in thiscase$K = J$. For Qwe have the following dichotomy: the Julia setcc J is connected if 0 has a bounded orbit, cc

connected. To understand what this means, imagine a set that is shaped like a comb. From any point in this set to any other point there is a continuous path that lies in the set, but it is possible for the two points to be very close and for the shortest path to be very long.This happens, for example, if the two points are the ends of neighboring teeth of the comb. A connected set X is called locally connected if every point has arbi- trarily small connected neighborhoods. It is possible tobuild comb-like sets (with infinitely many teeth) that contain points for which all connected neighborhoods have to be large. The filled Julia sets in the examples in figures 2–5 are locally connected, but there are examples of filled Julia sets that are not locally connected.When K is locally connected, then all external rays P

These regions will be separated by their boundaries, which together form the so-called$c$-values: that is, values of bifurcation set. This consists of “unstable”c for which there are other values arbitrarily nearby that give rise to qualitatively different dynamical behavior. In other words, a parameter bat i on ofc belongs to the bifurcation set if a small pertur-ccan make an important difference to the dynamics. setthe filled Julia set Recall the dichotomy that we stated earlier: the Julia Jc is connected if the critical point 0 belongs to Kc and is totally disconnected if 0 belongs to the attracting basin$A (\i\text{nf ty} )$.

We have therefore made a start toward ourc belongs goal, but the division of the plane into M and C . \1 is very coarse, and it does not obviously give us the complete understanding we are looking for. ∂Mhas a number of “holes” (in fact, infinitely many). The The important set is in fact not, which is illustrated in figure 7. Notice that this set M, but its boundary Mandelbrot set itself is obtained by filling in all these holes.

The “holes” arethe bounded components. set of a polynomial. It is easy to define the filled Juliaset, and the Julia set is then defined as its boundary.This definition is similar to the definition of the Julia The Julia set provides a lot of structure in the dynam-ical plane, thez-plane. The Mandelbrot set is similarly easy to define, and its boundary provides a lot of struc-ture in thec-plane. Remarkably, even though each Julia506 Figure 7 \text{The boundary}\partial M of the Mandelbrot set. set concerns just one dynamical system, while the Man-delbrot set concerns an entire family of systems, there are close analogies between them, as will become clear. and quadratic polynomials in particular was carried out in the early 1980 s by Adrien Douady and John H.Pioneering work on holomorphic dynamics in general Hubbard. They introduced the name “Mandelbrot set”and proved several results about it. In particular, they defined a sort of Böttcher map, denoted byΦM, for the Mandelbrot set, which is a map from the complement of the Mandelbrot set to the complement of the closed unit disk. The definition ofΦMis actually quite simple: for each cfor the parameter let ΦM (c) equal φc. However, Douady and Hubbard didc (c), where φc is the Böttcher map more than merely define holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse.$Φ^{M}$: they proved that it is a just as we did with the Böttcher map. For instance, Once we haveΦMwe can make further definitions, we can define a Mandelbrot set by setting potential GG(c)on the complement of the= g (c) = \log  |Φ (c)|.

Therefore, the center of a hyperbolic component cannot be structurally stable, sincethe critical orbit of the center-polynomial is finite, but it is infinite for all nearby polynomials. However, if weremove from the complex plane not just∂M but also all the centers of hyperbolic components, then we obtainthe splitting we have been looking for: any connected component of the remaining set forms a structurally stable region.

2.10 Newton’s Method Revisited

Let us return briefly to Newton’s method for polyno-mials. Consider any polynomial$P \text{of degree} d ⩾ 2 that$ has only simple roots. Then the Newton functiona rational function of degreed, and each simple root of NP is Pis a super-attracting fixed point of N . For quadratic P

polynomials the number of roots ofthe number of critical points of$N (since 2P \text{coincides withd} - 2 = 2P$

For polynomials of degree d > 2 there are more critical points than the roots can account for. polynomials with two distinct roots r\text{Cayley considered Newton}’s \text{method for quadratic}). \text{He showed that the function} \mu(z)P (z)==(z(z--r r)/(z1)(z--ront(o2)2), which maps the root\infty , provides a change of variables that turnsr1 onto 0 and the root1 r2$509$ Nsphere ˆP into the quadratic polynomial C. When one translates the dynamics of Q0 on the Riemann Q to the dynamics of Newton’s method one finds that theunit circle corresponds to the bisector of$r^{1} and (r^{2})^{0}and$ that all points in the half-plane containing$r$, i = 1,2, \text{i are therefore attracted to}ri \text{under iteration by} NP. Cayley announced that he would write about Newton’s iteration for cubic polynomials. However, it tookabout a hundred years before any such paper appeared. For a cubic polynomial Newton function$N$has three super-attracting fixed P with three simple roots the P

points, each of which gives rise to an attracting basin.The Julia set of NP is the common boundary of these three basins, and is therefore a complicated fractal set.Moreover, N has an extra critical point since 2 d-2 = 4 P$for$ d = 3. The extra critical point may be attracted to one of the roots under iteration, or it can have its own independent behavior. In order to catch the behavior of all cubic polynomials under Newton’s iteration (exceptthe one with one root of multiplicity three) it is sufficient to consider the one-parameter family of polyno-mials$P (z) = (z - 1)(z -^{1} - λ)(z -^{1} + λ)$. The extra critical point for the corresponding Newton function N then turns out to be at the origin. Suppose that w(eλ()2){2} associate three colors, for instance red, blue, and green, with the three roots 1,λ1 +λ,1 -λ. We can then color the\lambda as follows. A parameter value-plane, which is the parameter plane in this context,2 2 \lambda is colored red, blue, or green if the critical point 0 is attracted under iteration byany of the three roots, then we color with a fourth color, N\lambda to the root of that color. If it is not attracted to yellow, say. The universality of the Mandelbrot set is thereby demonstrated: in theyellow copies of it, which one can explain by showingλ-plane one can observe that families of suitably restricted iterates ofquadratic-like.$N^{λ} are$ 3 Concluding Remarks We have illustrated several results in holomorphic dy-namics through examples, including the transferring of definitions and results from the dynamical planesto the parameter plane. The structures of the filled Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set are partly under-stood through analysis of their complements, linked together via the Böttcher mapstions that are used for changing variables in$φ^{c} and Φ^{M}$.

Weis IV.15 Operator Algebras Nigel Higson and John Roe 1 The Beginnings of Operator Theory We can ask two basic questions about any equation, or system of equations: is there a solution, and, ifthere is, is it unique? Experience with finite systems of linear equations indicates that the two questions are interconnected. Consider for instance the equations 2$x + 3y - 5z = a$, x - 2 y + z = b,$3$ x + y - 4 z = c.

Notice that the left-hand side of the third equation isthe sum of the left-hand sides of the first two. As a result, no solution to the system exists unless But ifa + b = c, then any solution of the first two$a + b = c$. equations is also a solution of the third; and in anylinear system involving more unknowns than equations, solutions, when they exist, are never unique. Inthe present case, if(x, y, z) is a solution, then so is(x + t, y + t, z + t), for any t. Thus the same phe- nomenon (a linear relation among the equations) that

The general theorem illustrated by our particular numerical example aboveis that the number of linear conditions that the$i^{j} f mustj$

satisfy if a solution is to exist is equal to the number ofarbitrary constants appearing in the general solution when a solution does exist. To use a more technical vocabulary, the dimension of the kernel [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of the matrix cokernel. In the example, these numbers are both 1.K = {kji} is equal to the dimension of its [VI.66](/part-06/ivar-fredholm-18661927) made a study of A little more than a hundred years ago, integral equations of the type fredholm

 u(y) - k(y$, x)u(x) dx = f (y)$.

These arose from questions in theoretical physics, andthe problem was to solve for the functionu in terms of the function limit of finite sums, Fredholm’s equation is an infinite-f . Since an integral can be thought of as a dimensional counterpart of the finite-dimensional lin-ear systems considered above, in which vectors with nat infinitely many different points components are replaced by functions with valuesx. (Strictly speaking, Fredholm’s equation is analogous to a matrix equationof the typeu-Ku = f rather than Ku = f . The altered form of the left-hand side has no effect on the overall behavior of the matrix equation, but it does considerably alter the behavior of the integral equation. As weshall see, Fredholm was fortunate to work with a class of equations whose behavior mirrors that of matrix equations very closely.) A very simple example is

$u(y) -^{0}^{1} u(x) dx = f (y)$.

To solve this equation, it helps to observe that the quan-1 tityis a constant0 u(x) d. Thus in the homogeneous case (x, when thought of as a function off ≡ 0), y ,

So in this example the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the0 cokernel are both 1. Fredholm set out on a systematic exploration of the analogy between matrix theory and integral equations that this example suggests. He was able to prove that, for equations of his type, the dimen-sions of the kernel and of the cokernel are always finite and equal. [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), who made a detailed study of the Fredholm’s work sparked the imagination of hilbert integral operatorsin the special case where the real-valued function that transformu(y) into k(y, x)u(x) dxk, is symmetric, meaning thatk(x$, y) = k(y, x)$. The finite-dimensional counterpart of Hilbert’s theory is thetheory of real symmetric matrices. Now if K is such a matrix, then a standard result from linear algebra asserts that there is an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) for K, or equivalently that there is a unitary matrix U \text{such that} U-1 T U \text{is diago}- nal. (the lengths of vectors: Unitary means that Uv U is invertible and preserves = v for all vectors v.) Hilbert obtained an analogous theory for all symmetric integral operators. He showed that there exist func-tions$u1(y)$, u2(y), . . . \text{and real numbers} λ1, λ2, . . . \text{such that} k(y, x)un(x) dx = \lambda nun(y).

1.1 From Integral Equations to Functional Analysis Hilbert’s spectral theorem led to an explosion of activ-ity, since integral operators arise in many different areas of mathematics (including, for example, the dirichlet problem equations and the representation theory of com-[IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis) in partial differential pact groups [IV.9 §3](/part-04/representation-theory)). It was soon recognized that these operators are best viewed as linear transforma-tions on the hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) of all functionsu(y) such that|u(y)|2 dy < \infty . Such functions are called square-integrable denoted L2[0, 1]. , and the collection of all of them is able, it became convenient to examine a much broader With the important concept of Hilbert space avail range of operators than the integral operators ini-tially considered by Fredholm and Hilbert. Since Hilbert spaces are[III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces), it made sense to look first at operators from avector spaces [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and metric spaces Hilbert space to itself that are both linear and continu-ous: these are usually called bounded linear operators. The analogue of the symmetry conditionk(x, y) =k(y, x)bounded linear operatoron integral operators is the condition that a T be self-adjoint, which is to say that T u, v = u, T v for all vectors u and v in the Hilbert space (the angle brackets denote the inner product). A simple example of a self-adjoint operator is the multiplication operator by a real-valued function m(y)(Mu)(y); this is the operator$= m(y)u(y)$. (The finite-dimensional coun-Mdefined by the formula terpart to a multiplication operator is a diagonal matrix Kthe matrix entry, which multiplies thekjj.) jth component of the vector by operators tells us that every such operator can be givena particularly nice form: with respect to a suitable Hilbert’s spectral theorem for symmetric integral “basis” of L2[0, 1], \text{namely a basis of eigenfunctions}, \text{it will have an infinite diagonal matrix}. Moreover, \text{thebasis vectors can be chosen to be orthogonal to each other}. \text{For a general self}-\text{adjoint operator}, \text{this is nottrue}. Consider, \text{for instance}, the \text{multiplication} \text{operator from} L2[0, 1] \text{to itself that takes each square}-\text{integrable function has no eigenvector su}(y) \text{to the function}[I.3 §4.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions), \text{since ifyu}(y). This operator\lambda is an eigen- value every y[I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), then we need, which implies thatu(y)yu(y)= 0 \text{for every}= \lambda u(y)y notfor equal toλ, and hence that |u(y)|2 dy = 0. However, this example is not particularly worrying, since a multiplication operator of this kind is a sort of continuous analogue of the operator defined by a diagonal matrix.

512

It turns out that if we enlarge our concept of “diagonal”to include multiplication operators, then all self-adjoint operators are “diagonalizable,” in the sense that, after a suitable “change of basis,” they become multiplication operators. of theof complex numbers To make this statement precise, we need the notion spectrum [III.86](/part-03/the-spectrum) of an operator\lambda for which the operator T. This is the set T - \lambda I does not have a bounded inverse (here I is the iden- tity operator on Hilbert space). In finite dimensions the spectrum is precisely the set of eigenvalues, but in infinite dimensions this is not always so. Indeed, whereas every symmetric matrix has at least one eigenvalue, a self-adjoint operator, as we have just seen, need not.As a result of this, the spectral theorem for bounded self-adjoint operators is phrased not in terms of eigen-values but in terms of the spectrum. One way of formulating it is to state that any self-adjoint operator T is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator(Mu)(y) = m(y)u(y), where the closure of the range of the functionm(y) is the spectrum of T. Just as in the finite-dimensional case, aible operator U that preserves the lengths of vectors. Tounitary operator is an invert- say thatthere is some unitary map T and M are unitarily equivalent is to say that U, which we can think of as an analogue of a change-of-basis matrix, such that$U^{-1MU}$. This generalizes the statement that any real T = symmetric matrix is unitarily equivalent to a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues along the diagonal.

1.2 The Mean Ergodic Theorem

A beautiful application of the spectral theorem wasfound by von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957). Imagine a checkerboard on which are distributed a certain number ofcheckers. Imagine that for each square there is designated a “successor” square (in such a way that notwo squares have the same successor), and that every minute the checkers are rearranged by moving each oneto its successor square. Now focus attention on a single square and each minute record with a 1 or 0 whetheror not there is a piece on the square. This produces a succession of readings R1$, R2$, R3, . . .$\text{like this}$: 00100110010110100100· · · . We might expect that over time, the average numberof positive readings R = 1 will converge to the num-j

ber of pieces on the board divided by the number of squares. If the rearrangement rule is not complicated enough, then this will not happen. For example, in the most extreme case, if the rule designates each square

IV. Branches of Mathematics

as its own successor, then the readout will be either00000· · · or 111111 · · · , depending on whether or not we chose a square with a piece on it to begin with. But ifthe rule is sufficiently complicated, then the “time average”ber of pieces on the board divided by the number of(1/n()n)j=1 Rj will indeed converge to the num- squares, as expected. fact the only “sufficiently complicated” rules in this finite case are cyclic permutations of the squares of the The checkerboard example is elementary, since in board, and thus vation post in succession. However, there are related all the squares move past our obs er examples where one observes only a small fraction ofthe data. For instance, replace the set of squares on a checkerboard with the set of points on a circle, and inplace of the checkers, imagine that a subset S of a cir- cle is marked as occupied. Let the rearrangement rulebe the rotation of points on the circle through some irrational number of degrees. Stationed at a pointthe circle, we record whetherx belongs to S, the firstx of rotated copy ofso on to obtain a sequence of 0 or 1 readings as before.S, the second rotated copy of S, and One can show that (for nearly everyof our observations will converge to the proportion ofx) the time average the circle occupied by Similar questions about the relationship between S. time and space averages had arisen in thermodynamics and elsewhere, and the expectation that time and space averages should agree when the rearrangement ruleis sufficiently complex became known as the ergodic hypothesis Von Neumann brought operator theory to bear on. this question in the following way. Let H be the Hilbert space of functions on the squares of the checkerboard, or the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the circle. The rearrangement rule gives rise to a unitary operator U on H by means of the formula(Uf )(y) = f (φ-1(y)),

It can be shown that the eigenvalues of this operator form a sequence proportional to$\\{−1}$, -1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}, -1, . . . . A hydrogen atom, when disturbed, may release a photon, resulting in a drop in its total4 9 energy. The released photon will have energy equal tothe difference between the energies of the initial and final states of the atom, and therefore it is propor-tional to a number of the form 1/n2 - 1/m2. When light from hydrogen is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, bright lines are indeed observed at wavelengths corresponding to these possible energies.Spectral observations of this sort provide experimental confirmation for quantum mechanical predictions.So far we have discussed states of a quantum system only at a single instant. However, quantum systems evolve in time, just as classical systems do: to describe this evolution we need a law of motion. The time evo-lution of a quantum system is represented by a family of unitary operators$U$: H \to H, \text{parametrized by thet}

The quantum law of motion is that the responding in this way to time evolution is the opera-generator E cor- tor associated with the observable “total energy.” When$E$is realized as a differential operator on a Hilbert space of functions (as in the examples above), this state-ment becomes a differential equation, the Schrödinger equation.

First, there may be nonzero vectors whose length, as measured by the inner product, iszero (although the hypothesis thatσis positive definite does rule out the possibility that there might be vectorsof negative length).

(The trace of the identity operator is a case in point: the diagonal entries are all 1, and if there are infinitely many of them, then their sum is not well-defined.)

2.1 Decomposing Representations

Leton a Hilbert spaceg \to  U^g be a unitary representation of a group H. If a closed subspace H of HG is mapped into itself by all the operators Ug, then it0 is said to be antion. If H0 is invariant, then since the operators invariant subspace for the representa-Ug map Hre presentation of0 to itself, their restrictions to G, called a subrepresentati on H0 constitute anotherof the original.A subspace H0 is invariant for a representation, and so determines a subrepresentati on, if and only if the orthogonal projection operator P:$H \to H belongs$ to the commutant of that representation. This pointsto a close connection between subrepresentati ons and0 von Neumann algebras. In fact, von Neumann algebra theory can be thought of as the study of the ways in which unitary representations can be decomposed intosub representations. ial invariant subspace.

As with prime factorization, the decomposition process for a finite-dimensional unitary representation has only one possible end: there is, up to ordering, a unique list of irreducible representations into which a given unitary representation decomposes.

516

But in infinite dimensions the decomposition process faces a number of difficulties, the most surprising of which is that there may be two decompositions ofthe same representation into entirely different sets of irreducible subrepresentati ons.In the face of this, a different form of decomposition suggests itself, which is roughly analogous to the factorization of an integer into prime powers instead of individual primes. Let us refer to the prime powers into which an integer is decomposed as its components. They have two characteristic properties: no two com-ponents share a common factor, and any two (proper) factors of the same component factor. Similarly, one can decompose a unitary repre-do share a common sentation intogous properties: no two distinct isotypical components isotypical components, which have analoshare a common (meaning isomorphic) subrepresentati on, and any two subrepresentati ons of the same isotypical component have themselves a common subsub representation. Any unitary representation (finite dimensional or not) can be decomposed into isotypical components, and this decomposition is unique.In finite dimensions, every isotypical representation decomposes into a (finite) number ofducible subrepresentati ons (like the prime factors ofidentical irrea prime power). \text{In infinite dimensions this is not so}.\text{In effect}, \text{much of von Neumann algebra theory is concerned with analyzing the many possibilities thatarise}. 2.2 \text{Factors The commutant of an isotypical unitary} \text{representation} \text{is called a factor}.

Let G be a group and let H =2(G) be a Hilbert space having basis vectors ing to the elementsg \in  G.

Because of this observation, we can think ofan algebra of operators on whatever Hilbert space we M as an algebra of operators on HM, rather than as began with.Next, the adjoint operation equips the Hilbert space $\text{Hby the formula}^{M}$ with a natural “antilinear” operator1$S(V ) = V^{*}$.

2.4 Classification

A crowning achievement of von Neumann algebra theory is the classification of factors that are approximately finite dimensional in a certain sense limits of finite-dimensional algebras.. These are the factors that are Besides the range of the dimension function, which sep-arates factors into types, the sole invariant is the module from the modular automorphism group.. This is a flow on a certain space that is assembled standing problem of distinguishing among the type IIfactors associated with the regular representations of A lot of attention is currently being given to the long groups. Of special interest is the case of free groups [IV.10 §2](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory), around which has flourished the subject offree probability theory. Despite intensive effort, some fundamental questions remain open: at the time ofwriting it is unknown whether the factors associated with the free groups on two and on three generators are isomorphic. theory Another important development has been, which attempts to classify the ways in which subfactor factors can be realized within other factors. A remark-able and surprising theorem of Vaughan Jones shows that, in the type II situation, where continuous values of dimensions are the norm, the dimensions of subfactors can in certain situations assume only a discrete rangeof values. The combinatorics associated with this result have also appeared in other apparently quite unrelated parts of mathematics, notably knot theory [III.44](/part-03/knot-polynomials). 3$C^{*} - Algebras$ Von Neumann algebra theory helps describe the structure of a single representation of a group on a hilbert space. But in many situations it is of interest to gain an

understanding of all possible unitary representations.To shed some light on this problem we turn to a related but different part of operator algebra theory.Consider the collection B(H) of all bounded oper- ators on a Hilbert spaceent structures: algebraic operations, such as addition,$H$. It has two very differ multiplication, and formation of adjoints; and analytic structures, such as the operator norm

$T = \sup {T u}$:$u ⩽ 1$.

These structures are not independent of one another.Suppose, for instance, that T < 1 (\text{an analytic hypoth}- esis). Then the geometric series

$S = I + T + T^{2} + T^{3} + · · ·$

converges in B(H), \text{and its limit Ssatisfies} S(I - T ) = (I - T )S = I.

It follows that I - T is invertible in B(H) (an algebraic conclusion). One can easily deduce from this that the spectral radiusthe greatest absolute value of any complex number inr (T ) of any operator T(defined to be the spectrum of The remarkable T ) is less than or equal to its norm.spectral radius formula goes much further in the same direction. It asserts that\lim (Tn()1)/n. If T \text{is normal} (T T* = T*T), \text{and inr} (T ) = \text{particular if}(Tn)n =→\infty T Tn. As a result, the spectral radius ofis self-adjoint, then it may be shown that T is precisely equal to the norm of T. There is therefore a very close connection between the algebraic structureof B(H), particularly algebraic structure related to the adjoint operation, and the analytic structure.Not all the properties of B(H) are relevant to this connection between algebra and analysis. A$C^{*} - alge-$ braties for the argument of the previous two paragraphs to A is an abstract structure that has enough proper- remain valid.

One can define a continuous branch of the complex logarithm functionon such a subset, and it follows that there is an element a = \log u of the algebra such that a = −a^* and u = e^a . The patht \to  eta, 0 ⩽ t ⩽ 1, is then a continuous path of unitaries inunitary sufficiently close to the identity is connected to A connecting u to the identity. Thus every the identity by a unitary path.

3.2 Further Examples of$C^{*} - Algebras$

3.2.1 The Compact Operators

An operator on a Hilbert space hasrange is a finite-dimensional subspace. The operators finite rank if its of finite rank form an algebra, and its closure is a$C^{*}-$ algebra called the algebra ofdenoted K. One can also view compact Kas a “limit” of matrix operators and algebras $M^{1}(C) \to M^{2}(C) \to M^{3}(C) → · · ·$, where each matrix algebra is included in the next by

$A \to A0 00$.

Many natural operators are compact, including the inte-gral operators that arose in Fredholm’s theory. The identity operator on a Hilbert space is compact if andonly if that Hilbert space is finite dimensional.

3.2.2 The CAR Algebra

The presentation of K as a limit of matrix algebras leads one to consider other “limits” of a similar sort.(We shall not attempt a formal definition of these limits here, but it is important to note that the limit of asequence A \to  A \to  A → · · · depends on the homo- morphisms One particularly important example is obtained as the1 Ai \to2(Ai()+1)3 as well as on the algebras Ai.) limit $M1(C) \to M2(C) \to M4(C) → · · ·$, where each matrix algebra is included in the next by

Moreover, it is the that given anyone and only one homomorphism C*-algebra A and unitary C*(Zu) \to \in  AA, there issending Ucalculus homomorphism for the unitaryto u. In fact, this is nothing other than the functionalu. If instead we consider the universal example of a C*- algebra generated by two unitaries U , V subject to the relation

4 Fredholm Operators

Ato be a bounded operator Fredholm operator between Hilbert spaces is defined T for which the kernel and cokernel are finite dimensional. This means thatthe homogeneous equation T u =0 admits only finitely many linearly independent solutions, while the in homogeneous equation$T u = v \text{admits a solution if} v$ satisfies a finite number of linear conditions. The terminology arises from Fredholm’s original work on integral equations; he showed that if K is an integral operator, then$I + K \text{is a Fredholm operator}$. dimensions of the kernel and cokernel must be equal, but in general this need not be so. The For the operators that Fredholm considered, the unilateral shift operator tor”(a , a , a S, . . . ), which maps the infinite “row vec-to$(0, a , a , . . . )$, is an example.$\text{The equationthe equation}1 2$ Su^3 Su == 0 has only the zero solution, butvhas a solution only if the first1 2 coordinate of the vectorv is zero. integer difference The index of a Fredholm operator is defined to be the index$(T ) = \dim (ker(T )) - \dim (coker(T ))$. For example, every invertible operator is a fredholm operator of index 0, whereas the unilateral shift is a Fredholm operator of index-1.

Although the coefficients of these equations are veryclose, the dimensions of their kernels are quite different: the left-hand system has only the zero solution, whereas the right-hand system has the nontrivial solutions(t$, -2t)$. Thus the dimension of the kernel is an unstable il ar remark applies to the dimension of the cokernel.invariant of the system of equations.

precise expression to these stability properties. Atkin-son’s theorem asserts that an operator An important theorem of Frederick Atkinson gives T is Fredholm if and only if it is invertible modulo compact opera-tors. This implies that any operator that is sufficiently close to a Fredholm operator is itself a Fredholm operator with the same index, and that ifoperator and K is a compact operator, then T is a Fredholm T + K is a Fredholm operator with the same index asthat, since integral operators are compact operators, T . Notice this contains Fredholm’s original theorem as a special case.

4.2 The Toeplitz Index Theorem

topology mat ical systems that remain the same when the sys-[I.3 §6.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) studies those properties of mathetem is (continuously) perturbed. Atkinson’s theorem tells us that the Fredholm index is a topological quantity. In many contexts it is possible to obtain a for-mula for the index of a Fredholm operator in terms of other, apparently quite different, topological quan-tities. Formulas of this sort often indicate deep connections between analysis and topology and often have powerful applications. The simplest example involves the Toeplitz operators. A Toeplitz operator has a matrix with the special form⎛ ⎞⎜⎜⎜bb^0^-^1 bb^1^0 bb^2^1 bb^3^2 · · ·· · ·⎟⎟⎟T = ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜bb^-^-^2^3 bb^-^-^1^2 bb^0^-^1 bb^1^0 · · ·· · ·⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟ .⎝ ... ... ... ... . .. ⎠

In other words, as you go down each diagonal ofthe matrix, the entries remain constant. The sequence of coefficients$\i\text{nf ty}=−$\infty bnz-n on the unit circle in the complex plane$,{bn}\i\text{nf tyn}=−$\i\text{nfty defines a function}$f$ (z) = called theshown that a Toeplitz operator whose symbol is a con-n symbol of the Toeplitz operator. It can be tinuous function which is never zero is Fredholm. Whatis its index? as a mapping from the unit circle to the nonzero com-plex numbers: in other words, as a closed path in the The answer is given by thinking about the symbol nonzero complex plane. The fundamental topological invariant of such a path is its winding number: the number of times it “goes around” the origin in the counter clockwise direction. It can be proved that the index of a Toeplitz operator with nonzero symbolis minus the winding number off . For example, if ff is the function$f (z) = z (\text{with winding number} + 1)$,

then the associated Toeplitz operator is the unilateral shift S that we encountered earlier (with index -1). The Toeplitz index theorem is a very special case of the atiyah–singer index theorem topological formula for the indices of various Fredholm[V.2](/part-05/the-atiyahsinger-index-theorem), which gives a operators that arise in geometry.

4.3 Essentially Normal Operators

Atkinson’s theorem suggests that compact perturba-tions of an operator are in some sense “small.” This leads to the study of properties of an operator thatare preserved by compact perturbation. For instance, the complex numbers essential spectrum\lambda for whichof an operator T - \lambda I fails to be Fred-T is the set of holm (that is, invertible modulo compact operators).\text{Two operators} T and T \text{are essentially equivalent if there is a unitary operator differ by a compact operator}.

The first and best example is K-theory.Ch om om or phism of*In its most basic form,-algebra A an Abelian group C*-algebras a corresponding homo-K-theory associates with each K(A), and with each morphism of Abelian groups. The building blocks for K(A) can be thought of as generalized Fredholm oper- ators associated with operators act on “Hilbert spaces” in which the complex$A$; the generalization is that these scalars are replaced by elements of the$C^{*} - algebra A$. The group connected components of the space of all such general-K(A)itself is defined to be the collection of ized Fredholm operators. Thus if$A = C$, \text{for instance} (so that we are dealing with classical Fredholm operators)$, then K(A) = Z$. This follows from the fact that two Fred- holm operators are connected by a path of fredholm operators if and only if they have the same index. can construct ent ingredients. For example, every projection One of the great strengths of$K$-theory classes from a variety of differ-K-theory is that onep \in  A defines a class in“dimension” for the range of K(A) which can be thought of as ap.

One of the most exciting research frontiers in operator algebra theory is reached along a path which develops these thoughts. The noncommutative geometry general program of Connes takes seriously the idea that a C*-algebra should be thought of as an algebra of functions on a “noncommutative space,” and goes onto develop “noncommutative” versions of many ideas from geometry and topology, as well as completely new constructions that have no commutative counterpart. Noncommutative geometry begins with the cre-ative reformulation of ideas from ordinary geometry in ways that involve only operators and functions, but not points.Consider, for instance, the circle S1. \text{The algebra} C(S1)\text{reflects all the topological properties of} S1, \text{but to incorporate itswell we look not just atmetric} (distance - related) \text{properties as} C(S1) \text{but at the pair consisting of the algebra Hilbert space} C(SH = 1 L)2\text{and the operator}(S1). \text{Notice that if} D = f \text{i dis a function}/dθ \text{on the on the circle} (\text{considered as a} \text{multiplication} operatoron H), then the commutator Df -f D is also a multipli- cation operator, this time by i dordinary measurements of angular distance between f /dθ. \text{It follows that}

However, Connes has argued that noncommutative C*-algebras play a role in describing the physical world even before the transition is made toquantum physics.

1 What Is Mirror Symmetry?

Mirror symmetry is a phenomenon found in theoretical physics that has had profound mathematical applica-tions. It burst onto the mathematical scene after Candelas, de la Ossa, Green, and Parkes exploited the physical phenomenon to make precise predictions about certain sequences of numbers describing geometric spaces. The sequence predicted by those authors began 2875, 609 250, 317 206 375, of calculation at the time. The phenomenon of mirror. . . , and was far beyond the scope symmetry is that some physical theories have equiv-alent, “mirror” theories that lead to the same predictions. If some prediction requires a hard calculation but is easy to perform in the mirror theory, then you can getthe answer for free! These physical theories do not have to be realistic models of physics. For instance, beginning students of physics often study point particleson frictionless planes. Although they are unrealistic, such toy models can bring the physical concepts into focus and their analysis can give rise to very interesting mathematics.

1.1 Exploiting Equivalences

Children at school in the 1950 s used log tables toexploit the equivalence of multiplication of positive numbers with addition of real numbers. Given the prob-lem of multiplying two large numbersa and b, they would use a table to look up the logarithms log(a) and logthen add them by hand. They would then use the same(b)(to a certain number of significant figures), table to find which number had a logarithm equal to$\log (a) + \log (b)$. The answer is ab. defined by College students sometimes exploit the equivalence fourier transforms [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) to solve differential equations. Basically, the Fourier transform isa rule that maps one functionf (x) to a new func- tion ˆderivativef (p). What is nice is that the transform of thef^ (x)relates in a very simple way to ˆf (p): it is i If you want to solve a differential equation such aspf (p)ˆ , where i is the imaginary number\sqrt{-1}$.f^ (x) + 2 f (x) = h(x)$, where h(x) is a given function and you are trying to findto its Fourier transform equation if , you can map the equationpf (p)ˆ$+$2 ˆ$f (p) =h(p)$ˆ . This is much easier: it is an algebraic equation

rather than a differential equation, and has the solu-tion ˆ$f (p) = h(p)/($ˆ 2$+ ip)$. The solution f (x) is then the function which has ˆh(p)/(2 + ip) \text{as its Fourier} transform.Mirror symmetry is like a fancy Fourier transform, mapping much more information than is contained ina single function. Every aspect of a physical theory is involved.This article will (eventually) focus on the mathematics of mirror symmetry, but it is crucial to understand its physical origins. We therefore begin with a brief guide to physics.

Stationary, \text{so this} particles sit at minima of the potential: examples area ball in equilibrium at the end of a spring, or a pea at the bottom of a bowl. In stable situations, there is arestoring force proportional to some displacement distance. This means that in some appropriate coordinate, F ∼ −x, so V (x) = kx2/2, for some k. The solutions are oscillatory, with angular frequencyω = k/m. This model is called the simple harmonic oscillator.

2.1.2 The Least Action Principle

Every major theory can also be formulated by means ofan idea known as the least action principle. Let us see how it works for the equations of Newtonian mechan-ics. Consider an arbitrary path of a particlex(t) and time. We denote position byponent position vector, and we denote time derivatives by dots, so1. Acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect tox, which is shorthand for a three-com- acceleration is denoted by  ̈x.

Likewise, we omit component notation on most vectors. The notation should be clear fromthe context. The quantity S(x), which is known as the action energy. One then considers which paths minimize this, equals the kinetic energy minus the potential action.

2.2 Quantum Theory

Mirror symmetry is an equivalence of quantum theo-ries, so we must develop an understanding of what a quantum theory is and what an equivalence looks like.There are two formulations of quantum mechanics: the operator formulation and Feynman’s path-integral formulation.Both formulations are probabilistic, meaning that you cannot predict exactly what will be observed in at the origin.3. In 3-space, the paraboloidz =1 2 ax2 +1 2 by2 has curvature ab

a single measurement, but you can make precise pre-dictions about what will be observed after multiple, repeated measurements in the same environment. For instance, your experimental apparatus may involve a beam of electrons hitting a screen and making a mark.The beam will contain millions of electrons, so the pattern of marks on the screen can be predicted with great accuracy. However, we cannot say what will happen toa single, given electron—all we can do is assign probabilities to the outcomes of various measurements.These probabilities are encoded in the so-called “wave function”Ψ of the particle.

2.2.1 Hamiltonian Formulation

In the operator formulation of quantum mechanics, the positions and momenta of classical mechanics (and any quantity formed from them) are converted intotors [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) acting on a hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) accord-operaing to the following rule:{· ,·} by i/ [· ,·], where [A, B]replace the Poisson bracket= AB -BA is the commu- tator bracket ple, we get from equation (1) the relation and is Planck’s constant. Thus, for exam-[x$, p] = i .$ The state of a particle (or system) is now defined not as a set of values of Hilbert space. Once again, time evolution is determinedx and p but as a vector Ψ in the by the Hamiltonian, basic dynamical equation is H, but now H is an operator. The HΨ = i ddt Ψ . (5)

This is called the Schrödinger equation.

Lesson. To quantize a classical theory, replace ordinary degrees of freedom by operators on a vector space; replace Poisson brackets by commutator brackets. In the case where we have a particle on the real line R, the Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable func-tions L2(R), so we write Ψ as Ψ (x). The commutation relation is obeyed if we think ofx as the operator that sends the function the relation[x, p] =Ψ (x)i means that we should repre-to the function xΨ (x). Now sentp \text{as the operator} - i (d/dx). The values of the classical quantity associated with an operator correspond to theso for example a state with momentum eigenvalues [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of that operator, p has the formΨ ∼ \exp (ipx/ ). Unfortunately, this is not square- integrable on the real line, but it would become so ifwe identifiedx and x +2πR, for some number (radius)R > 0. Topologically, this compactifies [III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) R to a circle, but note thatΨ will be single-valued only if IV.16. \text{Mirror Symmetry} p“quantized” \text{in units of} = n /R, where n is an integer.

In other examples, there is a or not it represents a geometric location.Another novelty is that position and momentum do not commute as operators in quantum mechanics, meaning they cannot be simultaneously diagonalized: you cannot specify the position and momentum simultaneously. This is a form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (see operator algebras [IV.15 §1.3](/part-04/operator-algebras)). 2.2.2 \text{Symmetry As the rules of quantization would suggest}, \text{a symmetry of a quantum theory is an operator}[H, A] = 0. \text{That is}, A \text{commutes with the Hamiltonian}, A \text{such that and therefore respects the dynamics}. 2.2.3 Example: \text{The Simple Harmonic Oscillator We now discuss an example that will be useful later on for understanding quantum field theory and mirror symmetry}: \text{the simple harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics}. \text{Suppose that the constants are chosen sothat the Hamiltonian is given by} H = x2 + p2. \text{If one defines one can show thata} = (x + iap)/† \text{raises the energy of a state by one}\sqrt{2} \text{and a}† = (x - ip)/\sqrt{2}, then unit5 anda lowers the energy by one unit.

2.2.4 Path-Integral Formulation

Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum me-chanics builds on the idea of the least action principle. In this formulation, the probability of an experiment is calculated through an average over all paths of particles, and not just the ones which extremize the action.Each pathx(t) is weighted by the factor exp(i S(x)/ ), where Planck’s constant, which is very small compared with S(x) is the action of the path x(t) and is macroscopic action scales. This average can be an imag-inary number, but the probability of the process is the square of its absolute value. Note that exp$(i S/ ) = \cos (S/ ) + \text{i sin}(S/ )$, so if S changes appreciably when we varyand imaginary parts will oscillate rapidly, sincex(t), then the realis small. Then, when we integrate over pathsx(t), the positive and negative oscillations will roughly cancel.As a result, the main contributions to the weighted sum over paths will come from those paths for whichnot vary when the path does: the classical paths! How-S does ever, if the variations are sufficiently small compared with , then nonclassical paths can contribute appreciably. One typically separates the degrees of freedom intothe classical trajectory piece and the quantum fluctuations near it. Then one can organize the path integralin a perturbation theory around the parameter . integral, and will not go into the details of this. The We have not yet discussed the integrand of the path main point is that the theory makes a prediction aboutthe likelihood of measuring a physical process. Each process determines a possible integrand. For example, from our discussion above we learn that the integrand for measuring the likelihood of a quantum-mechanical particle going from the pointx at time t to the pointx1 at time t1 gives nonzero weight—determined by the0 0 exponentiated action—to all paths that go fromx as t goes from t to t , and zero weight to all otherx0 to paths.1 0 1 integral on a “space-time” that consists of just a single It is illustrative to consider a toy model of a path point. Then the possible “paths” of a scalar field, say, are simply the values that the field can take at the point, so they are real numbers. The action is then an ordinary function let us consider the case where i S(x) on R. For the purposes of this example, S/ = −1 x2 +\lambda x3. The possible integrands are (sums of) powers ofbasic path integrals to perform are(x2)k \exp x(-, so the1 x2 +\lambda x3)dx, which we denote by xk. \text{The value at}2λ = 0

is easily calculated.7 For small\lambda we expand e^\lambda x3 as 1 +\lambda x3+λ2 x6/2+· · · , and evaluate each term by the same methods as forλ = 0. This is how we construct a well- defined perturbation theory, even when the integral isnot calculable. iest when the action is only quadratic in the variables, just as we found in the operator formulation of quan-As we see from this example, path integrals are eastum mechanics. The mathematical reason for this isthat Gaussian integrals (exponentials of squares) can be done explicitly, while integrals involving exponen-tials of cubics or higher are difficult or impossible. For quadratic actions, the path integral can be evaluated exactly, but when cubic or higher terms appear, the perturbation series is necessary.

2.2.5 Quantum Field Theory

The generalization to field theories follows our earlier pattern. We think of quantum field theories, then, as being like quantum mechanics with infinite numbersof particles. In fact, the quantum field theories in which the fieldsΦ and their derivatives do not have more than quadratic terms in the action are easily understood inthis way—we had a preview of this in equation (4). The Fourier components correspond to particles indexed bytheir momenta. Each one looks like a simple harmonic oscillator at some frequency, which will depend on the Fourier coefficient. The quantum Hilbert space is then a (tensor) product of lots of different “occupation num-ber Hilbert spaces,” one for each Fourier component of each field. Since the occupation number basis is alsoan energy eigenbasis, these states have a simple time evolution under the hamiltonian on some state$Ψ (t = 0)$, then that state evolves like H. That is, if H = EΨ (t) = \exp (i Et/ )Ψ (0).

higher However, if the action includes terms that are, then things get interesting: particles can decay!cubic or This can be seen, for example, from the scalar field ofequation (3) if we include a termφ3 \text{in the action}, and therefore also the Hamiltonian. If we write this using Fourier components, we get terms involving three oscillators, such aswe quantize the real field$(a^{†})^{3}(a^{†})^{4}a^{7}$. To see this, recall that afterφ, the Fourier components$7$. Consider\exp (-1 x2 + Jx)dx = \exp (-1 (x + J)2) \exp (1 J2) dx$2$= \sqrt{2π} \exp2(1 J2)$.^{2}$ Now if we differentiate this answer with respect towe get$x$.

Such decay processes occur in real life, and it is a great triumph of quantum field theory that it can predict such events with astounding accuracy. dimensional, the path integral in quantum field theoryis not usually defined in a mathematically rigorous way.In fact, because the space of paths of fields is infinite However, the perturbation series for producing predictions can be defined just as for quantum mechan-ics, and this is how physicists make their predictions in practice. This perturbation series is organized interms of Feynman diagrams (which are discussed in vertex operator algebras and the rules for computing them, completely solve the[IV.17](/part-04/vertex-operator-algebras)). These diagrams, perturbation problem. integrands of the path integral correspond to different As in the example of quantum mechanics, different predictions. Ifquantum field theory, we writeΦis some function of the fields of someΦ for the path inte- gral withΦ as an integrand (as we did for xk in the previous section). We call such a term a “correlation function.” If$Φ = φ (x ) · · · φ (x )$, the answer will depend on the action of the theory$, \text{the fields}1 1$ nn φ , andi

always remains a symmetry of the same theory after quantization. The answer is sometimes no. Such a case One might wonder if a symmetry of a classical theory is known as an “anomaly.” Roughly speaking, this isbecause the measure of integration of the path integral is not preserved under the symmetry, but thisis a somewhat heuristic explanation because the path integral has no rigorous definition in general.Returning to our cubic example, if the interaction termφ3 has a coefficientλ, so that it is λφ3, then we organize the perturbation series as a power series in In terms of paths, probabilities of decay processes canλ. be evaluated by considering paths that split into two— like the letter Y—with each leg carrying the label of the appropriate particle.

2.2.6 String Theory

Feynman’s perturbation theory has an important gener-alization in string theory. String theory considers particles not as points but as loops. Instead of paths ofparticles through space-time, we get paths of loops,

IV.16. Mirror Symmetry

which look like two-dimensional surfaces. String theory amplitudes are computed by summing over all surfaces. These sums are organized in a perturbation series in powers of the so-calledstant,λ^g. The power of λ^g in the perturbation series string coupling con- depends on the number of holes in the surface.The surfaces are called worldsheets. At each point of the worldsheet, its location in space-time is deter-mined by coordinates$X^{i}$. These coordinates them- selves depend on the location on the worldsheet. Ineffect, we get an auxiliary theory: a field theory of coordinates on the two-dimensional surface! In string theory, even this two-dimensional field theory mustbe considered as a quantum field theory. The fields of the two-dimensional theory are maps from the sur-face to actual space-time. However, from the point of view of the worldsheet, the worldsheet itself is a two dimensional space-time and the maps are fields onspace-time with values in some other (target) space.this study of these quantum field theories on two-dimen-Mirror symmetry was discovered as a result of the sional surfaces. Subsequently, the same phenomenon was discovered in the case where the strings were not closed loops but filaments with endpoints. Both casesplay an important role below. 3 Equivalence in Physics Mirror symmetry is a particular type of equivalence ofquantum field theories. As we have seen, quantum field theories are rules for producing probabilities of physi-cal processes. In the path-integral formulation, probabilities are computed from correlation functions offields. According to Feynman, these correlation functions can be thought of as being averages over all paths of fields. Each path is weighted by expthe action of the path and is Planck’s constant. Let us$(i S/ )$, where S is denote the correlation function of some integrand theory A as Φ . Recall that Φ can depend on variousΦ in fieldsφi and points of space-time A xi, and the correla- tion function will depend on all these and the action oftheory$A$.φBi Equivalence, then, is a map from all possible fields such thatin a theory$A$to corresponding fields  ̃$φ^{i} \text{in a theory}Φ^{A} = Φ$ ̃B.

The most typical example of mirror sym-metry is the physical theory whose fields are mapsφ from a two-dimensional some target space, M . Such a theory is called ariemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces)sigmaΣ to modelrole of actual space-time, but for our purposes we can. As we saw above, in string theory M plays the even consider the case where M is the real line R, so thatφ is an ordinary function. This case has already been studied in section 2.1.5. The action is given inequation (4). We can then write the partition function as

One first$τ = Zit$ (this is the Wick rotation), which leads to an imaginary Euclidean action i$S^{E}$. One then tries to evaluate the path integral in this framework, hoping that the answer willbe holomorphic [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). If it is, then one can use analytic continuation to work out the answer for ordi-nary time. The advantage is that the Euclidean exponential weighting becomes exp$(-S / )$, so the minima E ofmight converge. The nonconstant minima of the Euclid-SE receive the greatest weighting and the integral ean action are called equation (4), the action becomes the “energy”instantons.

For example, correlation functions can involve any number of fields, each evaluated at differ-ent points on the two-dimensional surface. This is typically too unwieldy a situation to approach mathemati-cally. Instead, equipped with a symmetry of the theory called “supersymmetry,” a mathematical distillation can be performed. The distillation procedure is called topological twisting theory” has correlation functions that are independent, and the resulting “topological field of the positions of points. Because of this independence, the correlation functions are certain characteris-tic numbers associated with the underlying geometric setup. In fact, there are two types of twisting, typically called A and B, which capture different aspects of the manifold in question.

4.1 Complex and Symplectic Geometry

4.1.1 Complex Geometry

To get a feel for the geometric aspect captured by topo-logical twisting, recall that we can construct the circle Sθ1+from the real line2π, and therefore also R by identifying the pointsθ +2πn, where n is any inte-θ and ger. What we have done is identified points related by alattice of integer translations. We could choose the lattice to consist of multiples of some other real number rall scaling of, but since any two such lattices differ only by an over-R, we would effectively get the same space. In the complex plane C, we can do the same thing with a two-dimensional lattice of translations generated bytwo complex numbers$λ^{1} and λ^{2}$, as long as the quo- tienthas the same topology as any two-dimensional surfaceλ2/λ1 is not real. This space is called a torus and with one hole. It has more structure, however, becauseit can be covered by regions described by a complex coordinate—with different regions related by complexanalytic maps. The pairs(λ , λ ) and (λ , λ + λ ) generate the same lattice of translations, as do thepairs(λ , λ ) and (λ , -λ ). \text{In fact}, \text{lattices related} b(y1()2()1()2)1 1 2 2 1

That is, the theoryτ.

4.1.2 Symplectic Geometry

Another aspect of geometry is thewhich is described simply by an area element. Let ussize of the torus, recall that, topologically, all tori look like R2 with points identified by the lattice of integer horizontal and verti-cal translations (but not necessarily in a way that would respect any complex geometry). The points of the toruscan be thought of as the unit square with opposite sides glued together. An area element in R2 looks like ρsquare.

That is, theρ.

4.2 Cohomological Theories

As you might imagine, the passage from an ordi-nary theory to a topological theory involves identifying

531

many aspects of the physical theory that were previ-ously distinct, such as different point values of a single field. Mathematically, a well-established method of pro-ducing topological aspects of a structure—and one that involves making identifications—is through aology theory [IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology). Cohomology theories follow co hom the pattern of having an operator tionδ ◦ δ = 0. We think of this equation as the state-δ obeying the equa- ment imageis formed as the quotient(δ) ⊂ ker(δ). The cohomology group H(δ) = ker(δ)/ image H(δ)(δ), which means that we identify any two vectors$v satisfying δu = δv =$0, so long as the differenceu andu - v can be written as δw for some w. Then H(δ) is just the space of all such vectors, up to identifications.The topological twisting of physical theories is similar. The operatorδ is a physical operator acting on a Hilbert space of states. The presence of super symme-try in our theories ensures thatδ exists and squares to zero. The vector states of the topological theory are just the elements of$Ψ obeying δΨ =H(δ)$0, up to identification. In many cases,, i.e., states in the original theory these states can be identified with ground states. contains the complex translations of points on the two-dimensional surface. This means that the value of a It is crucial that supersymmetry is a symmetry that field operator valueφ(z^ ) at another. In other words, the physics ofφ(z)at one point is identified with its the topological theory is independent of the positions of the operators! In the path-integral formulation, thismeans that the correlation functions are independent of the positions of the fields inserted into the integrand.What can they depend on, then? They depend on the particular field or combination of fields inserted, andthey depend on the geometric parameter (such asρ orτ) of the space M.

4.2.1 The A-Model and the B-Model

Given a Calabi–Yau space, one can actually construct twozero. There are therefore two distinct corresponding operators,δ^A and δ^B, each of which squares to topological twistings and two distinct topological the-ories that can be constructed from a Calabi–Yau space. wonder if the topological models constructed from If M and Ware mirror Calabi–Yau pairs, you might them will still be equivalent theories.

For example, the Euler characteristic of one is the negative of the other.We emphasize here that the two manifolds may 5 Basic Example: T-Duality Although the circle is not complex, it provides avery illustrative entry into mirror symmetry that can be studied quite easily. We will find an equivalence between two theories constructed from circles. The equivalence will be very nontrivial, however, as statesof very different kinds will be shown to correspond. Consider the case where the two-dimensional surface is a cylinder, with spatial dimension a unit circle, andone dimension of time, and let us look at the sigma model (these were introduced in section 3). Suppose also that the target space is a circle of radius R, which we denote bytwo points identified if they differ by a multiple of 2(SR)1. We think of (SR)1 as the real line, withπR. Maps from one circle to another can be classified bytheir winding number, an integer that tells you how many (net) times the image of a point goes around thesecond circle when the point goes once around the first.

Nevertheless, we have demonstrated the stronger statement that the twosigma models with target space$S^{1} and S^{1} \text{are equiva}-$ lent. The theories are mirror pairs. In the special case ofcircles, mirror symmetry is referred to as T-duality. In$(R^{1})^{/}R$ fact, the entire phenomenon of mirror symmetry—evenfor noncircles—can be deduced from T-duality.

5.2 The General Case

The torus is the only compact one-dimensional Calabi–Yau space and is therefore the simplest one, but the discussion above is part of a more general picture. The Calabi–Yau condition ensures a unique complex volume element, or orientation (dods” determine, and in turn vary with, the complexz, above), whose “per i parameters. Though the A- and B-models both turn outto be rather simple in the case of the torus, what is important in general is that the B-model is completely determined by how the periods of the complex volume element (which werewith the parameters of the theory (of which there wasλ1 and λ2 \text{in section} 4.1.1) change just one in section 4.1.1, namelyτ = λ /\lambda is quite simple for the torus, but more com-τ). Again, the relation plicated in general. In any case, this data gives all the information of the B-model. The reason for all of this is2 1 that the instantons of the B-model turn out to be justthe constant maps. Each point of the target space determines a constant map, and as a result the B-model isreduced to (classical) complex geometry of the target space. This is determined by the periods.This state of affairs is to be compared with the Amodel. The A-model depends on the symplectic param-etersρ, i.e., the areas of two-dimensional surfaces the details for simplicity.10. The parametersτ and ρ can also have real parts, but we neglect

inside the target space. In contrast to the B-model, however, the dependence onρ is very complicated, in general. The reason for this is that the instantons of the A-model are area-minimizing surfaces inside the target space, and their enumeration is a notori-ously challenging problem. (The problem is not terribly challenging for the torus, however.) Mathematically, the A-model instantons are described by the theory of Gromov–Witten invariants, the subject to which we now turn. 6 Mirror Symmetry and Gromov–Witten Theory As we mentioned above, the B-model onentirely by the classical complex geometry of W is explained W. The only relevant maps for B-model computations are the constant ones, so the space of such maps is equal tograls over W itself, and correlators reduce to (classical) inte-W . In fact, one of the integrands to be inte- grated is the complex volume element. Let us call the parameter for all possible complex volume elementsτ. B-model correlation functions are then determined byτ-dependent integrals over W . In particular, the parti- tion functionso we write it as(ZB)(W )Z(W )\text{of the} B - \text{model on}(τ). W depends on τ, The main point about topological twisting is that B local variations of the fields are all identified, as theyare related by the operatorδ. In particular, varying the point on the worldsheet is a trivial operation in the topological theory. It turns out that, for the B-modelon W, only the constant maps contributed, but for the A-model the situation is a bit more subtle. To give a feelfor the geometry, consider again the winding of a map from a circle to a circle. Maps with different windings can never be deformed continuously into one another. The winding number is a measure of how the first circle “wraps” (or winds) around the target, according tothe map. Because it is a discrete parameter it cannot change under continuous variations. Likewise, whenis a higher-dimensional space, the two-dimensional sur-$M$ faceof MΣby different amounts. The parameters for wrap-can “wrap” around two-dimensional subspaces ping are again discrete.

Different classes may contribute differently not only through the exponential weighting, but also$k$ in accordance with how many contain.

If you fix the boundary with a wire, the soap film will seek to find the minimumarea surface with that boundary.)

7.1 Nongeometric Theories

Mirror symmetry is about an equivalence of quantum field theories, and not every such field theory has the geometric content of a target space as in the sigma model. The structure involved in mirror symmetry—or at least its topological version—begins with a quantum theory with a supersymmetry algebra that allows for the passage to a topological theory. That is, there isa Hilbert space of states, a Hamiltonian operator, and a particular algebra of symmetries, i.e., operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. There are no dictates as to how one constructs such a setup, and the sigma model of maps to a target space is only one such way. Other methods abound. The geometric case is merelythe one most suited for mathematicizati on (and exposition), which is why we have focused on the theory witha target space. bly not—we will discuss the so-called orbifold theories.As an intermediate case—possibly geometric, possi7.2 Orbifolds When space-time is a cylinder S1 as its spatial dimension, there is a fascinating con-S1 \times  R, with a circle struction in quantum field theory known as antheory.

These additional configurations are thus part of the orbifold theory.

For example, rotations act on the X on which a dis- plane, and we can consider the four-element group gen-erated by a right-angle rotation. The quotient of the plane by these rotations looks like a cone. As another example, the finite groups of symmetries of the platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, etc.) act on the two-dimensional sphere by rotations. When we take$X = S^{2}$ and In fact, if we simply take the space of orbits of the G a platonic group, we get an interesting orbifold. group G, it is topologically just a sphere again, but not a smooth one—it has cone points. These cone points would be trouble some in a quantum field theory, but the “stringy” orbifold is perfectly “smooth.”The orbifold theory itself carries a symmetry. For example, ifments, then there is an untwisted sector and a unique G is the commutative group with two ele- twisted sector. There is a symmetry corresponding to multiplication by 1 in the untwisted sector and by-1 in the twisted sector. This symmetry is not geomet-ric. Orbifold theories with symmetries can often themselves be orbifolded in such a way as to recover the orig-inal theory. In fact, the theory and its orbifold are also often mirror pairs! Greene and Plesser used such a con-struction to create the first examples of mirror pairs. Further more, they used ways of ascribing geometric interpretations to some non geometrically constructed which are the same as group elements when13. The twisted sectors are properly labeled by conjugacy classes, G is commutative.

This which Candelas et al. made their famous predictions. 8 Boundaries and Categories The entire story of mirror symmetry becomes much richer when we allow the strings to have endpoints. Strings with ends are called “open strings,” while “closed strings” refers to loops. Mathematically, allow-ing ends corresponds to adding boundaries to the worldsheet surfaces. With this addition, we would liketo perform the same topological twisting. To do so, we must first ensure that some supersymmetry con-dition persists when we put the boundary conditions on the fields. If we begin with a Calabi–Yau target man-ifold, we can ask to preserve the conditions that allow either the A-twisting or the B-twisting (but not both: the boundary condition will destroy some symmetry, much as pinning a rope will constrain its degrees of freedom). After the twist, the boundary topological theory will depend on symplectic or complex information, respectively. lie on a Lagrangian subspace. The Lagrangian condition constrains half the coordinates; for linear spaces it is For the A-model, the endpoints or boundaries must like a restriction to the real part of a complex vector space. For the B-model the boundaries must lie on a complex space. Locally, a complex space looks like C$n$ and a complex subspace is described by complex analytic equations in the coordinates. A boundary condi-tion that preserves supersymmetry and allows a chosen topological twisting is called aogy mimics the word “membrane,” but applies to anybrane. (The terminol dimension.) In short, A-branes are Lagrangian; B-branesare complex.

boundary theory, one appeals to the mathematical notion of a To package all the information of the topological category [III.8](/part-03/categories). A category is a way of talking about structure: it consists ofany pair of objects there is a space of objects morphisms, and for from one object to the other. Often the objects are mathematical structures of some kind and the morphisms from one object to another are the functions that preserve the relevant structure. For example, if the objects are (i)spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), (iii) groups sets [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (iv)[I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (ii)vector spaces topological [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), or (v) chain complexes, then the morphisms are, respectively, (i) maps [I.2 §2.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar), (ii) continuous mapsmaps [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces), (iii)[I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), or (v) chain maps. The morphism spaces homomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), (iv) linear between objects should be thought of as some kindof relational data. Morphisms themselves interact with one another, as they can be composed when the endobject of one morphism is the start object of another. The composition is associative, so whether you com-puteabc as (ab)c or a(bc) does not matter. A use- ful image is a directed graph, which is a category with vertices as objects and paths between two vertices as morphisms. Composition is defined in this category by concatenating paths. boundary conditions, we construct a category whose objects are branes (i.e., boundary conditions).

One can also imagine a cate- gorical definition that captures the structure of surfaces with handles and holes. Indeed, the proper mathematical framework for a complete understanding of mirror symmetry is still under construction.

Beyond the morphism spaces, one checks finally that the compositions of correspond-ing morphisms correspond, just as for logarithms and slide rules. Doing so proves Kontsevich’s conjecture.

8.2 Definition and Conjecture

In fact, Kontsevich’s definition of mirror symmetry isreally a conjecture stating that the boundary notion of mirror symmetry as an equivalence of categories is compatible with, and even implies, the traditional notion of mirror symmetry that relates Gromov–Witten theory and complex structures.One way to show this is to try to reconstruct the Gromov–Witten invariants from the boundary theory.A heuristic, geometric approach to doing so involves looking at the diagonal boundary condition in twocopies of a space. A disk mapping into two copies of a space is described by two maps of a disk intothe space. Further, if the boundary condition is diagonal, this means that the maps have to agree on the boundary. What we have, then, is two disks inside a space which agree on the boundary. That is exactly what a sphere is: two disks (or cups) glued together! The disks are the two hemispheres, and they are glued torus. The rank is the dimension of that space. The degree is roughlya measure of the complexity of the bundle. For example, if we have a15. A vector bundle assigns a vector space to each point of the two-dimensional surface and consider the bundle that assigns to eachpoint the tangent space at that point, the degree is equal to 2$- 2g$, whereg is the number of holes on the surface.

along the equator. Now the minimal disks are instan-tons for the open string (with boundary), and by gluing them together along a common boundary, we have constructed a minimal sphere, or closed-string instanton. Thus the open string on this double theory should recover the closed string on the original theory. formations as deformations of the category of branes.A more algebraic approach sees the closed-string de That is, a change in bulk (nonboundary) theory inducesa change in boundary theory. But once equipped with a category, one can classify its deformations intrinsically.That is, if one views a category as a fancy algebra,16 then, as the deformations of an algebra are easily clas-sified through a notion called Hochschild cohomology, the deformations of a category can be treated similarly.One arrives at the maxim that the closed string is the Hochschild cohomology of the open string. By comput-ing the Hochschild cohomology of a brane category, one can, in principle, check this maxim, establish Kontse-vich’s conjecture, and then prove the connection to traditional mirror symmetry and Gromov–Witten theory. 9 Unifying Themes How does one find mirror pairs construction?

Of course, one can attempt to mathematicize the physical argument, but that does not seem to lead to insights into the construction—perhaps because path integrals and other methods of quantum field theory such as renormalization are not very well understood mathematically. Batyrev has devised a procedure for constructing mirror pairs within the context of toric geometry. This method is a generalization, to a wide class of examples, of the original construction of Greene and Plesser.The recipe has been extremely successful in producing examples of every stripe. However, the underlying meaning behind the construction is unclear. is a physical argument that makes contact with math-ematics, but it has not yet been made rigorous.

Further more, the choices of TTon themust equal the choices of P, i.e., the manifoldif we can find the brane T on W, we can parametrize the M . Therefore, choices of M of W from T , and recover W itself. M. So we can find the mirror to say about the structure of the Calabi–Yau spaces involved in mirror symmetry. Specifically, the choices This construction is geometric and has something of a Lagrangian brane always look like a family of tori.Therefore, M itself should look like a family of tori. Further, one can argue that by performing T-duality infamilies of tori (in a similar way to how one does it for a single torus), one arrives back at the mirror manifold, W. This is what we did for the torus, thought of as a cir- cle family (member of the family, we found the mirror torus. So$(S^{R}()^{1})^{2}) \text{of circles} (S^{R}()^{1})^{1}$. When we T-dualized each mirror symmetry is T-duality, and Calabi–Yau spacesof mirror symmetry should look like families of tori. This approach also relates to the homological mirror symmetry construction. Though promising, it remains mathematically elusive.Various points of view on mirror symmetry are helpful for different applications. To date, no unified under-standing of the phenomenon has been achieved. To some extent, we are still “feeling the elephant.” 10 Applications to Physics and Mathematics As a computational tool in string theory, mirror sym-metry is unparalleled in its power. When combined with other physical equivalences, its power is multiplied. For example, there are certain equivalences in physics that relate one type of string theory to another.Without going into the details of string theory, we can get a flavor of its complexity by returning to mir-ror symmetry. Recall that the B-model was able to compute the difficult instantons on the A-model, yieldinga great simplification of the two-dimensional quantum field theory on the worldsheet. But this whole quantum field theory was just an auxiliary tool for computing some Feynman diagram for the perturba-tion theory of the full string theory! Unfortunately, a satisfactory description of the full string theory path integral is, at the time of writing, way out of reach. String theory instanton effects are mostly unknownto us, unless a string equivalence or other argument can relate them to a perturbative effect in aent string theory. The perturbative string calculation differ-

Tracing through chains of equivalences in such a manner, many different phenomena in string theory can ultimately be calculated via mirror symmetry. perturbative and perturbative aspects of a single theoryby outsourcing the calculations to equivalent theories In principle, one should be able to calculate all nonand exploiting mirror symmetry. The barriers to doingthis at the time of writing are largely technological, not conceptual.Beyond physics, the rich texture of mirror symmetry means that there is interesting mathematics to be discovered in the proper formulation of the problem. For example, defining the precise categories of branes in full generality remains a challenge.Yet there are also direct applications to mathematical questions. We have already discussed how enumerative geometry has been revolutionized by mirror symmetry and the counting of instantons. Results in symplectic geometry have also been obtained. Occasionally, two objects may be proven to be equivalent as B-model branes. If the A-model mirrors can then be found, one has the result that the corresponding Lagrangian sub-spaces of the mirror symplectic space are also equivalent. Of course, to make such an argument, one mustfirst prove Kontsevich’s version of mirror symmetry for the mirror pair considered. As a final recent example, Kapustin and Witten have found a relation of mirror symmetry to the geometric Langlands program in representation theory. This program, loosely stated, is a correspondence between objects associated with two dimensional surfaces and Lie groups. From a surfaceΣ and a gauge group G, one constructs the space M of solutions to Hitchin’s equations. Central to that pro-gram are complex analytic objects on M that behave H nicely under the action of an algebra of operations.The Langlands correspondence relates two sets of such H objects: one easy to calculate and the other more dif-ficult. In fact M is itself a family of tori, and the easy objects correspond to points. Mirror symmetry states that the points should turn into the tori under H T-duality, so the hard objects should correspond to the tori themselves! It is an appealing proposition, andmaking it precise mathematics will be difficult—but the gauntlet has been thrown down.The discovery that mirror symmetry relates to the geometric Langlands program has elicited great excitement among researchers and reveals yet another facetof this fascinating phenomenon.

Algebra is the mathematics that places more emphasis on abstract structure than on intrinsic meaning.The conceptual simplifications that can result when context is stripped away from structure give algebra a special power and clarity compared with other areas: compare, for example, the difficulty of visualizing fourdimensional space with the triviality of manipulating quadruples this abstractness can also blind us.

Vertex operator algebras are the algebra of string theory: they should be thoughtof as the same sort of gift to the twenty-first century that Lie algebras were to the twentieth. 2 Where VOAs Come From The two most revolutionary developments in physics inthe early twentieth century are usually held to be relativity and quantum mechanics. They are revolution-ary not just because they have consequences that are extremely counter intuitive, but also because they pro-vide very general frameworks that can potentially affect all physical theories: one can take a theory from classi-cal physics, such as the theory of the harmonic oscillator or the theory of electrostatic force, for example, andone can try to make it “relativistic,” so that it becomes compatible with relativity, or to “quantize” it, so that itbecomes compatible with quantum mechanics. fully compatible with quantum mechanics. To put this another way, the ultimate concern of relativity is grav-Unfortunately, nobody knows how to make relativity itation, and a direct application to gravity of the usual quantizing techniques fails. This ought to mean that a fundamentally new physics arises at small distance scales that we are ignoring. Indeed, naive calculations suggest that the space-time “continuum” at distance scales of around 10-35 m \text{should deteriorate into some} sort of “quantum foam,” whatever that might mean.(10-35 m is extremely small: for instance, the order of magnitude of the size of an atom is 10$-10 m$.) proach to quantum gravity is string theory. The elec-Perhaps the most popular and controversial aptron is aa point. In string theory, the fundamental object is aparticle, i.e., in principle it can be localized to string, a finite curve of length approximately 10$-35 m$. In place of the dozens of kinds of fundamental particlesin the generally accepted quantum field theory, there is only one string, whose precise physical properties(mass, charge, etc.) depend on its current “vibrational mode.”

For reasons that we will sketch below, much of string theory reduces to studying confor-As the string moves, it traces out a surface called mal field theory, which is the induced quantum theory on these surfaces. Probably no other structures have affected so many areas of “pure” mathematics in so short a time as string theory and, what is essentially the same thing, conformal field theory. Indeed, five of the twelve Fields Medals awarded in the 1990 s (namely, those to Drinfel’d, Jones, Witten, Borcherds, and Kontsevich) were for such work. We shall focus in this arti-cle on their algebraic impact; see mirror symmetry [IV.16](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) for some geometrical implications.

2.1 Physics 101

A quick overview of physics will be useful for the discussion. Further details can be found in mirror symmetry [IV.16 §2](/part-04/mirror-symmetry).

2.1.1 States, Observables, and Symmetries

A physical theory is a set of laws that govern the behav-ior of some kind of physical system. A state of that system is a complete mathematical description of thesystem at a particular time: for instance, if the system consists of a single particle, then we could take its stateto be its positionx \text{and momentum} p = m(d/dt)x (where measurable quantity such as position, momentum, orm is its mass). An observable is a physically energy. It is through observables that a theory is com-pared with experiment. Of course, for this to be true we also need to know what an observable is from a theoretical point of view. ical function of the state. For example, our single particle has energy In classical physics, an observable is just a numer-E, which depends on the posi- tion and momentum via a formula of the form$(1/2m)p^{2} + V (x)$. (This gives us the kinetic energy E = plus the potential energy.) Classical states at different times are related by the equations of motion, which are usually expressed as differential equations. However, string theory and conformal field theory (CFT) are quantum theories, which are significantly different from classical theories: one can think of them as “applied linear algebra.” Whereas a classical state was given by acollection of a few numbers (two, in the case of the particle above), a quantum state is an element of a hilbert spacecan think of as a column vector with infinitely many[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), which for the purposes of discussion we complex entries. As for a quantum observable, it is ahermitian operator [III.50 §3.2](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) on the Hilbert space,

As in classi-cal physics, one of the most important observables is energy, which is given by the Hamiltonian operator Hˆ. states to states has anything to do with the notionof a physical observation, and indeed the relationship It is far from obvious how a linear operator that takes between observables and observation is a major differ-ence between classical and quantum theories.

Finding exact solutions in physics is typi-cally impossible and rarely useful. In practice, it suffices to find the first few terms in some Taylor expansion ofthe solution. This so-called “perturbative” approach to quantum theories is particularly transparent in Feyn-man’s formalism, where each term of the expansion can be represented pictorially as a graph. See figure 1(a)for typical examples. The graphs contributing to the nnth-order term in this Taylor expansion will involve vertices. Feynman’s rules describe how to convert these graphs into integral expressions for computing the individual terms in the Taylor expansion.In this article we are interested in perturbative string theory.

To see how some observable acts on some state, one writes the observable in terms of the basic observables$a$ˆ, ˆa† and the state in terms of the basic states |n . In this algebraic way we can recover all of the physics.This idea of building up the whole space H from the vacuum and the operators is a fruitful one in mathematics as well: something similar happens for themost important modules of most of the important Lie algebras.

The prototypical example of a distribution is the distribution Dirac delta functionδ(x - a). Despite its name, this is not a function: rather, it is defined by the property that

f (x) δ(x - a) dx = f (a) (1)

for any sufficiently well-behaved function thoughδ(x - a) is not a function, one can informallyf (x). Even interpret it as the derivative of a step function, andone can visualize it as equaling 0 every where except at x = a, where it is infinite, in such a way that the infinitely tall and infinitely thin rectangle under the graph has area 1. However, it really only makes sense inside an integral, as in (1). Similar remarks apply to

distributions in general, so a quantum field can really only be evaluated inside an integral of space and time, applied to some “test function” likeof such an integral will be an operator on the statef above. The value space H. takes Poisson brackets of classical fields. Similarly, commutators of quantum fields involve delta functions Dirac deltas appear in classical mechanics when one too.

2.2 Conformal Field Theory

Awith a two-dimensional space-time whose symmetries conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory include allwhat this means in the next paragraphs, but for now itconformal transformations. We shall explain is enough to know that a CFT is a particularly symmet-rical kind of quantum field theory. A CFT lives on the worldsheet sometimes colliding and separating, through time. InΣ traced by a set of strings as they evolve, this subsection we shall informally sketch their basic theory; in section 3.1 we shall be more precise. sions, has two almost independent halves. This is eas-iest to see in the context of string theory: the ripples CFT, like any quantum field theory in two dimenon the string are responsible for the physical proper-ties (charge, mass, etc.) of the corresponding state, but they can move (at the speed of light) either clockwiseor counter clockwise around the string. When they do so, they just pass through each other without inter-acting. These two alternatives, clockwise and counter clockwise, yield the two CFT, one first analyzes its chiral halves and then splices chiral halves of CFT. To study a them together to form the “bichiral” physical quanti-ties. Almost all attention in CFT by mathematicians has focused on the chiral (as opposed to physical) data, and indeed that is where vertex operator algebras live. Forease of presentation, we will usually suppress one of the chiral halves.A conformal transformation is a transformation that preserves angles. The simplest reason one can givefor why two dimensions are so special for CFT is that there are far more conformal transformations in two dimensions than there are in higher dimensions. When n >binations of translations, rotations, and enlargements.2 the only examples are the obvious ones: com This means that the space of all local conformal trans-formations in R(nn)+2 nis far richer: it is= 2 the space of local conformal transformations isinfinite2 dimensional. However, when dimensional. Indeed, if you identify R2 with the complex plane C, then any morphic function [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)f (z) that does not haveholo-

zero derivative at a pointa CFT is invariant under conformal transformations$z0 \text{is conformal near} z0$. Since and there are many conformal transformations, a CFTis especially symmetrical: this is what makes CFTs so interesting mathematically.Lie algebras arise naturally whenever one has local symmetries, and indeed one can form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra out of the infinitesimal conformal transformations. This algebra has a basisthat obeys the Lie-bracket relationsln, n \in  Z,[lm, ln] = (m - n)lm+n. (3)

The algebraic interpretation of the conformal symmetry of CFT turns out to be that these basis elements act naturally on all the quantities in the theory, as we$l^{n}$ shall explain below.The basic example that underlies all the others is when space-time sponding to an incoming string. It is parametrized byΣis a semi-infinite cylinder corretimet < 0 and the angle 0 ⩽ θ < 2π around the string. We can conformally map the cylinder to the punctured disk in C by$z = (e^{t}()^{-i})^{θ}$, so t = −$\i\text{nf ty}$ corresponds toz = 0. This allows us to say what we mean by conformal symmetries of the cylinder. ators of string theory.

We willfocus on the space of holomorphic fieldsφ(z), which we call V. This turns out to form a vertex operator algebra (as do the anti-holomorphic fields).For example, the most important vertex operator comes directly from the conformal symmetry: thestress-energy tensor T (z) ∈ Vis the “conserved current” that Noether’s theorem associates with the conformal symmetry.

Some of this we will touch on insection 4. The most important example here is the torus, where the chiral blocks are functions of fundamental mathematical importance. Amodular functions, a class of modular function is a meromorphic function (that is, a function that is holomorphic except at a few “poles” where it can tend to infinity)the upper half-plane H= {τ \in  f (τ)C | Imthat is defined onτ > 0} and that is “symmetric” with respect to the group SL2(Z) of 2 \times 2

matrices with integer entries and determinant 1, in thesense that for any such matrix(a b ) the function f (τ) is closely related (though not necessarily exactly equal)to the functionf ((aτ +b)/(cτ +c dd)). We shall discuss this further in section 3.2.The appearance of modularity can be understood by recalling from section 2.1.2 that Feynman’s path inte-gral in string theory is an integral over moduli spaces. The moduli spacethe quotient of the half-plane M1^,0 for the torus can be written as H by the action of SL (Z). Therefore, \text{if one lifts the integrand of Feynman}’s inte-\text{gral from} M to H, \text{one obtains a function} Z(τ)2 \text{that is invariant under SLgrand} Z(τ)1 \text{is a quadratic combination of the chira}(l,()0){2}(Z) \text{and hence modular}. \text{This inte}- \text{blocks for the torus}. 3 \text{What VOAs Are It is possible to give a fully axiomatic definition of ver}-\text{tex operator algebras}. However, \text{when one first encounters this definition} (\text{and not just the first time either})\text{it can seem very complicated and arbitrary}, \text{and one is given no feel for the importance of VOAs}. \text{Our treatment below will be much more informal}: \text{this will clarify their importance even if it hides much of their complexity}. \text{Thanks to the previous section}, \text{it is possible to givea quick justification for VOAs}: \text{if you concede that CFT} (\text{or equivalently}, \text{perturbative string theory}) \text{is important}, \text{and if you have seen how closely related CFT is to VOAs}, \text{then you must concede that VOAs are important}. However, \text{this is not the whole story}, \text{as we shall see}. 3.1 \text{Their Definition Let us begin by defining them in terms of other con}-\text{cepts that must themselves be defined}: \text{a vertex operator algebra is an algebra of vertex operators}, \text{or in other words the chiral algebra Vof a conformal field theory}. \text{The most important thing to understand in this definition is that a vertex operator is a quantum field}, which, \text{as we have seen}, \text{is an} “operator-\text{valued distribution of space} - time.” \text{So we can think of it informally as amatrix}-\text{valued function of space} - time, \text{where the matrix is}\infty \times\inftyand its entries can be generalized functions \text{like the Dirac delta} (1). However, we shall give a much better description of these vertex operators shortly. tured atretically this set corresponds to a semi-infinite cylin-By “space-time” we mean the unit disk inz = 0. Recall from section 2.2 that string-theo-C punc- der parametrized by the angle$-π < θ ⩽ π running$ around the string as well as the time−$\i\text{nf ty}$ < t < 0

546

running along the axis: the map from this to the punc-tured disk was(θ$, t) \to z = (e^{t}()^{-i})^{θ}$. We want to restrict our attention to quantum fields that depend holomor-phically on$z$. However, it is not obvious what “holomorphic” means for distributions. We touched on this question in section 2.2: now we shall look at it in more detail.To do this, we need a more concrete description of a vertex operator. The key idea is a very convenient algebraic interpretation of holomorphic distributions.

Consider the sum

$d(z) =^{n}=−∞\i\text{nf ty} z^{n}$. (5)

Multiply it by$f (z) = 3z^{-2} - 5z^{3}$, say. \text{This gives usf} (z)d(z) = 3 n=−$\i\text{nf ty}$\i\text{nfty zn}-2 - 5 n=−$\i\text{nf ty}$\i\text{nfty zn}+3 = 3 n=−$\i\text{nf ty}$\i\text{nfty zn} - 5 n=−$\i\text{nf ty}$\i\text{nfty zn} = −2 d(z). A few more examples like this will convince you thatf (z)d(z) = f (1)d(z) \text{for any polynomial function} f ofz and z-1. Therefore, d(z) behaves exactly like the Dirac deltaδ(z - 1), at least for polynomial test func- tions positive powers have a convergent sum only forf . Note that d(z) cannot converge for any|zz|: the$< 1$, and the negative powers only for$|z| >$1.

most important axiom to help us to pin it down fur-ther is locality. With a little work, one can show that So far our theory is seriously under determined. The this reduces to the condition that the commutator[Y (u, z), Y (v, w)] of two vertex operators should be a finite linear combination of the Dirac deltaz-1 \infty  (w/z)n and its derivatives (\partial k/\partial wδ(zk-)δ(zw) =-w)this, look at the case.

This equation may look strange. Why can we not sim-ply divide out the(z - n)N and get that all vertex operators commute? The reason is that when formal power series are involved, there can be zero divisors. For example, it is easy to check that0. Locality in the form (7) is at the heart of VOAs;(z - 1)n \in Z zn = for instance, one can express it as a triply infinite sequence of identities that the modes must obey, and this emphasizes just how restrictive a condition itis, and how correspondingly interesting it is to find examples of VOAs.

We have emphasized their physical origins A VOA is simultaneously a physical and a mathematin order to help explain the motivation for studying them. We know they should be valuable to mathematics, simply because CFT is, and indeed this is the case, as we shall see in section 4. But from a purely mathematical point of view, they might appear somewhatad hoc, as though we had a list of mathematical ingredients and said to ourselves, “Let’s consider this, andthen have some of these, oh, and perhaps one of those too, but with the following extra assumption: . . . .” For-tunately, there are more abstract formulations of VOAs that make them appear much less arbitrary as mathe-matical structures. For example, Huang has shown that they can be regarded as “two-dimensionalized” Lie alge-bras, in the following sense. If you want to keep track of the Lie brackets in an expression such as(which is important since the Lie bracket is not an asso-[a, [[b, c], d]] ciative operation), \text{you can do so with the help of abinary tree}, \text{and in fact it is easy to formulate Lie algebras in the language of such trees}. \text{If one then replaces binary trees by diagrams made out of spheres with legs}, \text{as we did with Feynman diagrams earlier}, \text{one obtainsa structure that is equivalent to a VOA}.

This section describes what are probably the two most significant applications of VOAs. But let us begin by listing (without any explanations) a few others.Inspired by the geometry of string theory, vertex operator (super)algebras have been assigned to manifolds, resulting in a powerful, though complicated, algebraic invariant of those manifolds that generalizes and enriches more classical data such as de Rham cohomology. VOAs associated with affine Kac–Moody algebrasat “degenerate” levelsk are deeply related to the geo- metric Langlands program. The modularity of affine algebra characters, as well as that of, for example, lattice theta functions, are all special cases of Zhu’s theo-rem, which places these modularities in a much broader context.

4.1 The Mathematical Formulation of CFT

Since the 1970 s quantum field theory has had con-siderable success, especially in geometry, by studying

IV. Branches of Mathematics

classical structures using infinite-dimensional meth-ods; this is a theme in particular of Atiyah’s school. Conformal field theories are a class of exceptionally symmetric quantum field theories, and they are also among the simplest nontrivial quantum field theo-ries known. In the past two decades mathematics has feasted on this combination of symmetry and (relative)simplicity, often by “looping” or “complexifying” more classical structures, and the impact of CFT (or, equiva-lently, of string theory) has been especially significant and broad. In hindsight the importance of CFT to mathematics is not surprising: it is a coherent and intri-cate structure that straddles several disparate areas of mathematics, sprawling across geometry, number theory, analysis, combinatorics, and indeed algebra. theory has been to CFT itself. Quantum field theories From this point of view, a crucial application of VOA are notoriously difficult to put on a rigorous mathe-matical footing. But the successful applications suggest that these difficulties are a symptom of mathemati-cal profundity and subtlety rather than of irreparable mathematical incoherence. In this sense the situation ishighly reminiscent of the deep conceptual challenges to eighteenth-century mathematicians that were raised bycalculus. The definition of a VOA by Richard Borcherds makes the chiral algebra of a CFT completely rigorous, as well as concepts like the operator product expansion. Subsequent work (especially by Huang and Zhu) reconstructs from the VOA more and more of the CFT, in arbitrary genus. The resulting clarity makes the whole subject more accessible to, and hence exploitable by, mathematicians. Quantum field theories are here to stay in mathematics, and thanks to VOAs mathemati-cians are absorbing a large class of them completely and explicitly.

4.2 Monstrous Moonshine

In 1978 Mc Kay noticed that 196 884$\approx 196 883$. Why was this an interesting observation? Well, the number on the left is the first meaningful coefficient of the function [IV.1 §8](/part-04/number-theory)$j - j(τ) = q - 1 + (744+)196 884q + 21 493 760q2 + 864 299 970q3 + · · ·$, (10)

This relation between modular func-finite simtions and the Monster was completely unexpected, asthey seem to occupy completely independent spots in the mathematical universe. Conway, Norton, and others fleshed out and expanded Mc Kay’s original obser-vation by making a number of conjectures, collectively called pair(g, h)Monstrous Moonshineof commuting elements in the Monster (a. For instance, with every \text{group of size about} 8$\times 1053)$, we expect there to be associated a function ular functions for some discrete subgroupj(g, h)(τ) that generates all mod-Γ(g, h) of$SL$ g =2(Zh)=. The identity.j-function would be assigned in the case The first major step toward proving these Moonshine conjectures was made by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meur-man in the mid 1980 s. They constructed an infinite dimensional vector space V% \text{out of formal power} series. They were motivated on the one hand by thevertex operators of string theory, and on the other by the formally similar distributions used in constructing affine algebra representations. This seemed a promising direction since for both string theory and affine algebra representations modular functions arise naturally. Together with a rich algebraic structure thatcame from these “vertex operators,”$V^{%} \text{was also acted}$ on in a natural way by the Monster group. Moreover, although V%is infinite dimensional, it comes packaged into finite-dimensional pieces“graded dimension”\dim (VV%)q% =n equals \i\text{nf ty}n=−1 j V-n %, and the744.

abstracting out their important algebraic properties he defined a new structure called a vertex (operator) algebra. His axioms clarified their relationship with (generalizations of) Kac–Moody algebras, and by 1992 he had proved the main Conway–Norton conjecture (which corresponds to the case wheretrary buth is the identity in the conjecture giveng is arbi- earlier). Although his definition of VOAs required a deep understanding of the physics of CFT, his elab-orate proof of this Moonshine conjecture is purely algebraic.We would now call V% a rational VOA with only one irreducible module (namely itself); its symmetry groupis the Monster and its character (8) is j(τ) - 744. The removal of the constant term 744 from (10) is signifi-cant as it says that the Lie algebra V%\text{is trivial}—\text{this is necessary if the symmetry group is to be finite}. \text{It is con}-\text{jectured that} V% \text{is the unique VOA with central charge}1 c = 24, trivial V1, \text{and only one irreducible module}. \text{This is meant to be reminiscent of the}[I.4 §4](/part - 01/general - goals), which is known to be the unique twenty-four-leech lattice dimensional even self-dual lattice with no vectors of$\sqrt$ lengthin the construction of2. Indeed, the Leech lattice plays a crucial role$V^{%}$. Most of the Moonshine conjectures are still open and this deep connection between modular functions andthe Monster is still somewhat mysterious. At the time of writing, however, VOAs still provide the only serious approach to the Moonshine conjectures. Borcherds defined VOAs to clarify the chiral algebra of CFT and to tackle Monstrous Moonshine. For thiswork, he was awarded a Fields Medal in 1998.

Some cynics claim that alge-braic combinatorics is not really a new subject but just a newics in order to enhance its (former) poor image, butname given to enumerative combinator algebraic combinatorics is in fact the synthesis of two opposing trends: abstraction of the concrete and concretization of the abstract the first half of the twentieth century, starting with. The former trend dominated Hilbert’s “theological” proof of the fundamental the-orem of invariants, in which he showed by abstract means that certain invariants existed, but not how tofind them. The latter trend is dominating contemporary mathematics, thanks to the omnipresence of The Mighty Computer. conceptualizati on(in short, The abstraction trend consists of the“bourbakization”, structuralizati on[VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935)) of mathematics., and categorization fancification, Enumeration did not escape this trend, and in the handsof such giants as Gian-Carlo Rota and Richard Stanley in America and Marco Schützenberger and Dominique Foata in France, classical, enumerative combinatorics became more conceptual, structural, and algebraic.However, as algebraic combinatorics has established itself as a fully fledged and separate mathematical speciality, the more recent trend toward thecrete, and constructive has left its mark as well. It has explicit, con revealed that many algebraic structures have hidden combinatorial underpinnings; the attempts to unearth these have led to many fascinating discoveries and unsolved problems.

Since the sizes of 1 that An^-a1 and 2= a A-n^-+2 aare clearly^- , which yields answer (iii)$.(a^{n})^{-1} and (a^{n})^{-2}$, it follows (example (iii)), \text{then a typical legal bracketing can bewritten recursively as If}(An)n \text{is the set of legal bracketings wit}(hn()1()n)2 [L ]L , where L andn L \text{pairsare smaller} (\text{possibly empty}) \text{legal bracketings}. \text{For exam} - ple, \text{if the bracketing is} 1[ [ ] [ ] ] [ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] (]2()1)2 \text{then Lthen}1 = L[ ] [ ]hasandn - L21 -= k[ [ ] ] [ [ ] [ [ ] ] ]pairs. \text{It follows that}.

It follows that

$f (x) = 1 - x1 - x^{2}$.

If one performs a partial-fraction decomposition, and expands the two resulting terms in a Taylor series, then one can obtain answer (i) to example (iv). 3 Weight Enumeration According to the modern approach, pioneered by Pólya, Tutte, and Schützenberger, generating functions are neither “generating,” nor are they functions. Rather, they areators of combinatorial sets. (Usually, but not always, formal power series that are weight enumerthese sets are infinite: for a finite set the corresponding“power series” has only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore a polynomial.)A power series\infty  a xn is called formal when one sheds its analytical connotation as a Taylor series of afunction, and thereby obviates the need to worry about n = 0 n convergence. For example, the sumfectly legal as a formal power series even though it$n = 0 n$!n!xn \text{is per}- converges only when$x = 0$. As for weight enumerators, consider the following situation. Suppose that we want to study the age distri-bution of a finite population. One way of doing this is to ask 121 questions. For each$\text{i between} 0 and 120$, we ask those whose age iscount each of these age-groups one by one, compilingi to raise their hand. Then we

$f (x) =^{1}20 a x^{i}$.i

But if the size of the population is much less than 120, itis much more efficient, because fewer questions would$i = 0$ be needed, to ask every person their age and then todeclare the weight of a person of agei to be xi. Then the generating function is the sum of these weights.That is,

$f (x) = x^{a}g(e^{(})^{p}erson^{)}$,

which is a natural extension of the caveman’s formulaof naive counting. Once we knowf (x) we can eas- ily compute statistically interesting quantities, like the average and the variance, which work out to be$\mu = f^ (1)/f (1) and σ^{2} = f^ (1)/f (1)+\mu-\mu^{2}$, respectively. (finite or infinite) combinatorial set, let us call ita certain numerical The general scenario is that we have anattribute,α: A \to  N, which assigns interesting A, and to each element of A a natural number. (Here we allow 0 as a natural number.) Then the A with respect to αis defined by the formula weight enumerator of

f (x) = x^α(a).

We shall also use the notation this equals$a \in^{A}|A|^{x} for f (x)$. Obviously,\inftyanxn,

Even if one does not, then itan, or, failing this, to extract the asymptotics.The fundamental operations for naive counting also hold for For example, weighted counting: just replace| · | by | · |x$.|A ∪ B|x = |A|x + |B|x (if$ A ∩ B = ∅) and|A \times B|x = |A|x · |B|x.

Let us quickly see why the second of these is true. If the members ofcal attributesα and A andβ, respectively, and one defines an B are endowed with numeri- 553 attributeγ on A \times B \text{by letting} γ(a$, b) equal α(a)+β(b)$, then

Let us see how these facts can be useful. First, consider theand 2 s, and let the attribute be “sum of entries.” then infinite set$A$, of all (finite) sequences of 1 s the weight of 1221 isa sequence(a · · · a x)6 is, and, in general, the weight ofxa^+···+a. The set A can be$\text{naturally decomposed as}1$(r1)k A = {φ} ∪ 1 A ∪ 2 A,

whereφ is the empty word, and 1 A is short for the set of all sequences obtained by prefixing a 1 to membersof A, and analogously for 2 A. Applying | · | , we getx|A|x = 1 + x|A|x + x2|A|x,

which, in this simple case, can be solved yield, once again explicitly, to

$|A|^{x} = 1 - x1 - x^{2}$.

the weight isnoted, it can be written as A legal bracketing$x^{0} = L1)$, or else, as we have alreadyis either empty (in which case L = [L ]L , where L and LL2 are (shorter) legal bracketings. Conversely, whenever and L are legal bracketings, so is1 [L2 ]L . Let1 L be the (infinite) set ofweight of a legal bracketing to be1 2 all legal bracketings, and define the$xn$, wher(e1)2 n is the number of bracket pairs[ ] is x and the weight of[ ][ [ ] [ [ ] [ ] ] ]. For example, the weight ofis x5. The set L decomposes naturally as follows:

$L = {φ} ∪ ([L] \times L)$,

whereφ denotes the empty word and [L] × L denotes the set of all words of the form L in L. This leads to the nonlinear[L(in fact, quadratic)1]L2 with L1 and$equation2$|L|x = 1 + x|L(|2)x,

which yields, thanks to the Babylonians, the explicit expression$\sqrt|L|x = 1 - 21x - 4x$.

This in turn gives us the answer to example (iii) above, via Newton’s binomial theorem. trees vertex has either no children or exactly two chil-Legal bracketings are equivalent to so-called, that is, unlabeled ordered trees where every binary dren.

Euler proved that|Odd(n)| = |Dis(n)| for all n. His “manipulatorics” proof goes as follows. Letd(n) be the number of odd and distinct partitionso(n) and offunctions$n$, respectively, and let us define the generating  f (q) =n \i\text{nf ty} = 0 o(n)qn and g(q) =n \i\text{nf ty} = 0 d(n)qn. With the help of the “multiplication principle” for weighted counting, Euler showed that  f (q) =i \i\text{nf ty} = 0 1 - q(12)i+1 and g(q) =i \i\text{nf ty} = 0(1 + qi). 556 \text{Using the algebraic identity} 1$+ y = (1 - y2)/(1 - y)$, we have\i\text{nf ty} \i\text{nf ty} -2 i 1 q(1 + qi) =

hence follows by extracting the coefficient of$g(q) = f (q)$, and the identityqo(n)n. = d(n) For a very long time, these kinds of manipulation were considered to belong to the realm ofand in order to justify the manipulations of the infi-analysis, nite series and products, one talked about the “regionof convergence,” usually|q| < 1, \text{and every step had} to be justified by the appropriate analytical theorem.Only relatively recently did people come to realize that no analysis need be involved: everything makes sensein the completely elementary and much more rigorous (from the philosophical viewpoint) algebra of formal power series gence, so as to exclude, for example, an infinite product. One still needs to worry about conver like$\i\text{nf ty}^{i} = 0(1 + x)$, but the notion of convergence in the ring of formal power series is much more user-friendly than its analytical namesake. Euler’s proof, while purely algebraic and elementary, Even though invoking analysis was a red herring, is nevertheless still manipulatorics. It would be muchnicer to find a direct bijection between the sets Dis(n) and Odd(n). Such a bijection was given by Glaisher. Given a distinct partition, write each of its parts as2 r · s, where s is odd, and replace it by 2^r copies of s.(\text{For example}, 123 + 3 + 3 + 3.) \text{The output is obviously a partition of the} = 4 · 3, \text{so we would replace} 12 \text{by same integer the partition}(n10, \text{but now into odd parts}. \text{For example},, 5, 4) \text{is transformed to the new par} - tition(5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1).

In fact, everything is combinatorics.

IV. Branches of Mathematics

All we need to do is to take the combinatorics out ofthe closet, and make it explicit. The plus sign turns into (disjoint) union, the multiplication sign becomes Cartesian product, and induction turns into recursion.But what about the combinatorial counterpart of the minus sign? In 1982, Garsia and Steven Milne filled this gap by producing an ingenious “involution principle”that enables one to translate the implication

$a = b and c = d ⇒ a - c = b - d$

into a bijective argument, in the sense that if D ⊂ B, and there are natural bijections f: AC \to ⊂ \text{AB andandg}: C \to D \text{establishing that} |A| = |B|, and |C| = |D|, then it is possible to construct an explicit bijection between A \C and B \D. Let us define it in terms of people. Suppose that in a certain village all the adults are married, with the result that there is a natural bijection from the set of married men to the set of mar-ried women,$m \to \text{Wife Of}(m)$, with its inverse w \to Husband of extramarital affairs, but only one per person, and all(w). In addition, some of the people have within the village. There is a natural bijection from theset of cheating men to the set of cheating women, called $m \to \text{Mistress Of}(m)$, with its inverse w \to  Lover Of(w). It follows that there are as many faithful men as there are faithful women. But how do we match them up?(One might imagine, for example, that each faithful man wants a faithful woman to go to church with him.) wife to come with him. If she is faithful, she agrees. Ifshe is not, she has a lover, and that lover has a wife. So Here is how it is done. A faithful man first asks his she tells her husband: “Sorry, hubby, I am going to thepub with my lover, but my lover’s wife may be free.” If this happens, then the man asks the wife of the lover of his wife to go with him, and if she is faithful, sheagrees. If she is not he keeps asking the wife of the lover of the woman who has just rejected his proposal. Sincethe village is finite, he will eventually get to a faithful woman.The reaction of the combinatorial enumeration community to the involution principle was mixed. On theone hand it had the universal appeal of a general principle, one that should be useful in many attempts tofind bijective proofs of combinatorial identities. On the other hand, its universality is also a major drawback, since involution-principle proofs usually do not give any insight into theone feels a bit cheated.

For example, if dinal it i es of{61,4111, 1111111} and {7,61 n ,=527 the car-} are the same. Garsia and Milne invented their notorious prin-ciple in order to give a Rogers–Ramanujan bijection, thereby winning a 50 prize from George Andrews.However, finding a really nice bijective proof is still an open problem.A quintessential example of a bijective proof is Prüfer’s proof ofthere are(nn)-2 \text{labeled trees oncayley}’s [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) celebrated result thatn vertices (example (v) earlier).

Can you find the appropriate set and the killer involution? 6 Pólya–Redfield Enumeration Often in enumeration it is easy enough to count objects, but what about unlabeled ones? For example, labeled the number of labeled (simple) graphs on(example (vi)) is trivially 2$n((n^{-1})^{)}/^{2}$, but how many un-n vertices labeled graphs are there onharder, and in general there are no “nice” answers, but$n$vertices? This is much the best known way is via a powerful technique initi-ated by Pólya, which was largely anticipated by Redfield. Pólya enumeration lends itself very efficiently tocounting chemical isomers, since, for example, all the

Calling each orbit a “family,” Note thatof the finite set G is a subgroup of the group of permutations A. families and we want to count the number of families.One way would be to define some “canonical head” of Suppose that there is a picnic consisting of many each family, say “mother,” and count the number ofmothers. But some daughters look like mothers, so this is not so easy. On the other hand, you cannot just count everybody, since then you would count each family several times. The problem is that “naive” counting of people (or objects) is giving a credit of 1 to each person, and this is in appropriate if we are trying to count families. If instead we were to ask each person “How bigis your family?” and add to our count the reciprocal of that number, then the calculation would come outjust right, since a family of sizek would get a credit of 1 have been counted exactly once by the end. Going back/k for each of its members, and would therefore to counting orbits, we see by the same reasoning thattheir number is

6.1 The Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion and

Möbius Inversion

Another pillar of enumeration is the principle of inclusion–exclusion (nicknamed PIE). Suppose that there aren sins, s , . . . , s , that a person may succumb to, and suppose that for each set of sins people who have all the sins in1 n S (and possibly others).S, AS \text{is the set of} Then the number of good people (without sins) is

The other route, “concretization of the abstract,” is almost every where dense in mathematics, and cannot be described in a few pages. Letme quote from the preface of the excellent New Perspectives in Algebraic Combinatorics(1999). by Billera et al. Algebraic combinatorics involves the use of techniques from algebra, topology, and geometry in the solution of combinatorial problems, or the use of combinato-rial methods to attack problems in these areas. Problems amenable to the methods of algebraic combina-torics arise in these or other areas of mathematics or from diverse parts of applied mathematics. Because ofthis interplay with many fields of mathematics, algebraic combinatorics is an area in which a wide varietyof ideas and methods come together.

7.1 Tableaux

An interesting class of objects that initially came upin group representation theory, but that turned out to be useful in many other areas—such as, for exam-ple, the theory of algorithms—are Young tableaux.

1.2 Topics

The examples described above illustrate some of the main themes of combinatorics. The subject, sometimes also called discrete mathematics, is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of discrete objects(as opposed to continuous ones) and their properties. Although combinatorics is probably as old as the human ability to count, the field has experienced tremendous growth during the last fifty years and has matured into a thriving area with its own set of problems, approaches, and methodology. basic mathematical discipline that plays a crucial role The examples above suggest that combinatorics is a in the development of many other mathematical areas.In this essay we discuss some of the main aspects of this modern field, focusing on extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. (An account of combinatorial prob-lems with a rather different flavor can be found in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics of course, impossible to cover the area fully in such[IV.18](/part-04/enumerative-and-algebraic-combinatorics).) It is, a short article. A detailed account of the subject can be found in Graham, Grötschel, and Lovász (1995).Our main intention is to give a glimpse of the topics, methods, and applications illustrated by representative examples. The topics we discuss include extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, the extremal theory of set systems, combinatorial number theory, combinatorial geometry, random graphs, and probabilistic com-binatorics. The methods applied in the area include combinatorial techniques, probabilistic methods, toolsfrom linear algebra, spectral techniques, and topological methods. We also discuss the algorithmic aspects and some of the many fascinating open problems inthe area. 2 Extremal Combinatorics Extremal combinatorics deals with the problem of determining or estimating the maximum or minimum possible size of a collection of finite objects that sat-isfies certain requirements. Such problems are often related to other areas, including computer science, information theory, number theory, and geometry. This branch of combinatorics has developed spectacularly over the last few decades (see, for example, Bollobás(1978)$, Jukna (2001)$, \text{and their many references}). 564 2.1 \text{Extremal Graph Theory Astructures}. \text{It consists of a set of points}, \text{called graph} [III.34] \text{is one of the very basic combinatorial vertices}, \text{some of which are linked by edges}. \text{One can represent a graph visually by drawing the vertices as points in theplane and the edges as lines} (\text{or curves}).

Many important optimization extremal problems that do not explicitly mention graphs can be reformulated, using the definitions above, as problems about extremal graphs.

2.1.1 Graph Coloring

Let us return to the map-coloring example discussed inthe introduction. To translate the problem into mathematics, we can describe the map-coloring problem in

IV. Branches of Mathematics

terms of a graph respond to the countries on the map, and two vertices G, as follows. The vertices of G cor- are connected by an edge in G if and only if the cor- responding countries share a common border. It is nothard to show that one can draw such a graph in such a way that no two edges cross each other: such graphsare called planar. Conversely, any planar graph arises in this way. Therefore, our problem is equivalent to the following: if you want to color the vertices of a planar graph so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, then how many colors do you need? (One canmake the problem yet more mathematical by removing the nonmathematical notion of color. For example, one can assign to each vertex a positive integer instead.)Such a coloring is called proper. In this language, the four-color theorem states that every planar graph canbe properly colored with four colors. Here is another example of a graph-coloring problem. Suppose we must schedule meetings of several parlia-ment committees. We do not wish to have two committees meeting at the same time if some parliament member belongs to both, so how many sessions do we need? Gvertices adjacent if and only if the corresponding com-. The vertices of Again we can model this situation by using a graph G represent the committees, with two mittees share a member. Aassigns to each committee one ofschedule is a functionk time slots. Moref that mathematically, we can think of it as just a function from$V \text{to the set} \\{1}$,2, . . . , k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. Let us call a schedule valid number. This corresponds to no two committees beingif no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same assigned the same time slot if they share a member. The question then becomes, “What is the minimal value of$k$for which a valid schedule exists?” graph colors in any proper coloring of The answer is called the G, denoted χ(G): it is the smallest number ofchromatic number G. Notice that a color-of the ing of a graphthe set of vertices of that color is independent. There-G is proper if and only if for each color fore, of independent sets into which it is possible to par-χ(G)can also be defined as the smallest number tition the vertices of G. A graph is called k-colorable if it admits a partitioned intok-coloring, or, equivalently, if it can bek independent sets. Thus, χ(G) is the minimum Two simple examples are in order. Ifk for which G is k-colorable. G is a complete graph Kn on n vertices, then obviously in any coloring ofare necessary. Of course, G all vertices get distinct colors, and thusncolors are also sufficient, n colors

If G is a cycle (C2()n)+1 on 2 n + 1 ver- three colors are needed, and three colors are enough: color the vertices along the cycle alternately by colors1 and 2, and then color the last vertex by color 3. Thus, χ(CIt is not hard to prove tha(t2()n)+1) = 3. G is 2-colorable if and only if it does not contain a cycle of odd length. Graphs that are 2-colorable are usually called split into two parts, with all the edges going from one bipartite, since they part to the other. The easy character ization ends here, and no simple criterion equivalent tok-colorability is available fork ⩾ 3. This is related to the fact that for each fixedk ⩾ 3 the computational problem of decid- ing whether a given graph isa notion discussed in computational complexityk-colorable is NP-hard, [IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity).Coloring is one of the most fundamental notions of graph theory, as a huge array of problems in this fieldand in related areas like computer science and operations research can be formulated in terms of graph coloring. Finding an optimal coloring of a graph is known to be a very hard task, both theoretically and practically.There are two simple yet fundamental lower bounds on the chromatic number. First, as every color class ina proper coloring of a graph G forms an independent set, it cannot be bigger than the independence number of|V (G)|G/α(G), which is denoted bycolors are necessary. Secondly, ifα(G). Therefore, at least G con- tains a clique of sizethat clique alone, and thusk, then χ(G)k colors are needed to color⩾ k. This implies thatχ(G) ⩾ ω(G), where ω(G) is the clique number of G. One of the simplest approaches to coloring a graph is todo it What about upper bounds on the chromatic number?greedily: put the vertices in some order and color them one by one, assigning to each one the smallest positive integer that has not already been assigned to one of its neighbors. While the greedy algorithm can sometimes be very inefficient (for example, it can color bipartite graphs in an unbounded number of colors, even though two colors are sufficient), \text{it often works quite well}. \text{Observe that when applying the greedy algorithm}, \text{a color given to a vertex than the number of the neighbors ofv is at most one morev preceding it in the chosen order}, \text{and is thus at mostd}(v) \text{is the degree of} v in G. \text{It follows that ifd}(v) \Delta+(G)1, \text{whereis the maximum degree ofat most}\Delta(G) + 1 colors. Therefore G, \text{then the greedy algorithm uses}χ(G) ⩽ \Delta(G) + 1. \text{This bound is tight for complete graphs and odd cycles}, 565 and, \text{as shown by Brooks in} 1941, \text{those are the onlycases}: if G \text{is a graph of maximum degree} \Delta, thenχ(G) ⩽ \D\text{elta unless} G \text{contains a clique} (K\Delta)+1, or \Delta = 2 and G contains an odd cycle. rather than the vertices. In this case a proper coloringis defined to be one where no two edges that meet at It is also possible to color the edges of a graph, a vertex are given the same color. Theof$G$, \text{denoted by} χ^ (G), is the minimum chromatic indexk for which G admits a proper edge-coloring withple, if G is the complete graph K , thenk colors. For exam-χ^ (G) = 2 n-1. This turns out to be equivalent to the fact that it is2 npossible to organize a round-robin tournament with 2 teams and fit it into 2 n -1 rounds: just ask the man- n\text{ager of a soccer league}. \text{It is also not hard to show that}χ^ (K ) = 2 n - 1. \text{Since in any proper edge}-\text{coloring ofdistinct colors}, \text{the chromatic index is obviously at least} G2 \text{all edges} o(fn)-1 G \text{that are incident to a vertex} v \text{get as big as the maximum degree}. \text{Equality holds for bipartite graphs}, \text{as proved by} Kö\text{nig in} 1931, \text{which implies the existence of a complete timetable usingd periods in the problem of teachers and classes discussed in the introduction}.

(Why not? Because a proper G with chromatic number less(r - 1)-coloring of G provides us with a proper (r - 1)-coloring of any sub- graph ofgraph G with G.) So a promising approach is to look for an vertices, chromatic number r - 1, and as many edges as possible. This is easy to find. Our con-straint is that the vertices can be partitioned into$r - 1$ independent sets. Once we have done that, we may aswell include all edges between those sets. The result is a complete$(r - 1)-\text{partite graph}$. A \text{routine calculation} shows that in order to maximize the number of edges, one should partition into sets that have sizes as nearly equal as possible. (For example, if$n = 10 and r = 4$, then we would partition into three sets of sizes 3, 3, and 4.)

2.1.3 Matchings and Cycles

Letedges in G be a graph. AG of which no two share a vertex. A matching matching in G is a collection of Mof the edges inin G is called Mperfect. (The idea is that the edges determineif every vertex belongs to one a “match” for each vertex: the match fory for which xy is an edge of M.) Of course, forx is the vertex G to have a perfect matching it must have an even numberof vertices. Hall’s theorem, which provides a necessary and suffi-cient condition for the existence of a perfect matching One of the best-known theorems in graph theory is in a bipartite graph. What kind of condition can this be?It is very easy to write down a trivial necessary condition, as follows. Letsets A and B of equal size. (If they do not have equal G be a bipartite graph with vertex size, then clearly there is no perfect matching.) Givenany subset S of A, let N(S) denote the set of all vertices in B that are joined to at least one vertex in S. If there is to be a matching, then it must be possible to assign toeach vertex in$S$a distinct “match,” so obviously N(S) must have at least as many elements asorem, proved in 1935, asserts that, remarkably, this$S$. Hall’s the obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. That is, if N(S) is always at least as big as S, then there will be a perfect matching. More generally, ifthen the same condition guarantees that one can find A is smaller than B, a matching that includes every vertex insome vertices in B unmatched). A (but leaves in terms of set systems.

A left coset Hg if theyg1 H share a common element. It is not difficult to show that Fsatisfies the Hall condition, and hence it has a per-2 fect matching M. Choosing for each edge (gi H, Hgj) ofthe required family of representatives.M a common element of gi H and Hgj, we obtain for the existence of a perfect matching in a general(not-necessarily-bipartite) graph There is also a necessary and sufficient condition G. This is a theorem of Tutte, which we shall not state here.Recall that C denotes a cycle of length k. A cycle is a very basic graph structure, and, as one might expect, there are many extremal results concerning cycles.$k$ Suppose that G is a connected graph with no cycles. If you pick a vertex and look at its neighbors and thenthe neighbors of its neighbors, and so on, you will see that it has a tree-like structure. Indeed, such graphsare called trees. An easy exercise shows that any tree withn vertices has exactly n - 1 edges. It follows that every graph cycle. If you want to guarantee that this cycle has cer-G on n vertices with at least n edges has a tain extra properties, then you may need more edges.For example, the theorem of Mantel mentioned earlier implies that a graphn2/4 edges contains a triangle G with n vertices and more than C = K .

2.2 Ramsey Theory

Ramsey theory is a systematic study of the following general phenomenon. Surprisingly often, a large struc-

ture of a certain kind has to contain a fairly large highly organized substructure, even if the structure itself is completely arbitrary and apparently chaotic. As succinctly put by the mathematician T. S. Motzkin, “Com-plete disorder is impossible.” One might expect that the simple and very general form of this paradigm ensures that it has many diverse manifestations in different mathematical areas, and this is indeed the case. (One should, however, bear in mind that some natu-ral statements of this kind are false for nonobvious reasons.)A very simple statement, which can be regarded as a basic prototype for what follows, is the pigeonhole principle with. This states that if a sets colors, then there must be a subset of X of n objects is colored X of size at least called monochromaticn/s that uses just one color. Such a subset is. The situation becomes more interesting if the set X has some additional structure. It then becomes naturalto ask for a monochromatic subset that keeps some of the structure ofobvious whether such a subset exists. Ramsey theory X . However, it also becomes much less consists of problems and theorems of this general kind. Although several Ramsey-type theorems had appeared before, Ramsey theory is traditionally regarded as having started with Ramsey took as his set Ramsey’s theorem X the set of all the edges in, proved in 1930. a complete graph, and the monochromatic subset he obtained consisted of all the edges of some complete subgraph. A precise statement of his theorem is as follows. Letexists an integerk and l be integers greater than 1. Then theren such that, however you color the edges of the complete graph withn vertices, using the two colors red and blue, there will either besuch that all edges between them are red orkl vertices vertices such that all edges between them are blue. That is, a suf-ficiently large complete graph colored with two colors contains a largish complete subgraph that is monochro-matic. Let R(k, l) denote the minimum number n with this property. In this language, the observation of Sza-lai, mentioned in the introduction, is that$R(4$, 4) ⩽ 20 (in fact,$R(4$, 4) =18). Actually, Ramsey’s theorem was more general, in that he allowed any number of colors, and the objects colored could berather than just pairs, as one has when coloring graphs.r -tuples of elements The exact computation of small Ramsey numbers turnsout to be a notoriously difficult task: even the value of

This provides a quick lower bound of$\sqrt{n} \text{for a}$ well-known problem of Ulam, asking for the typical length of a longest increasing subsequence of a random sequence of lengthn. A detailed description of the distribution of this length has recently been givenby Baik, Deift, and Johansson. In 1927 van der Waerden proved what became known as van der Waerden’s theorem: for all positive integersk and r there exists an integer W such that for every coloring of the set of integers$\\{1}$,2, . . . , W\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} using r col-$ors$, one of the colors contains an arithmetic progres-sion of lengthk. The minimum W for which this is true is denoted by W (k, r )are enormous: they grow like an Ackermann-W (k, r ). Van der Waerden’s bounds for type function.

2.3 Extremal Theory of Set Systems

Graphs are one of the fundamental structures stud-ied by combinatorial ists, but there are others too. An important branch of the subject is the study of set systems sets of some. Most often, these are simply collections of sub-n-element set. For example, the collection of all subsets of the set\\{1, 2, . . . , n\\} of size at mostn/problem in this area is any problem where the aim is to3 is a good example of a set system. An extremal determine, or estimate, the maximum number of sets there can be in a set system that satisfies certain con-ditions. For example, one of the first results in the area was proved by Sperner in 1928. He looked at the following question: how large a collection of subsets can onechoose from ann-element set in such a way that no set from the collection is a subset of any other? A simple example of a set system satisfying this condition is the collection of all sets of sizer , for some r . From this it immediately follows that we can obtain a collection aslarge as the largest binomial coefficient, which is$nn/^{2}$

Extremal and Probabilistic Combinatorics have a finite family Rd A fundamental theorem of Helly asserts that if you, and if any d + 1 of them have a point in common, F of at least d + 1 convex sets in then all sets in the family have a common point. Nowlet us start with a weaker assumption: given anyp of the sets, somed+1 of those p sets have a point in com- mon. (Herep is some integer greater than d + 1.)

2.6 Tools

Many of the basic results in extremal combinatorics were obtained mainly by ingenuity and detailed rea-soning. However, the subject has grown out of this early stage: several deep tools have been developed that have been essential to much of the recent progressin the area. In this subsection, we include a very brief description of some of these tools. Szemerédi’s regularity lemma is a result in graph theory that has numerous applications in various areas, including combinatorial number theory, computational complexity, and, mainly, extremal graph theory. The precise statement of the lemma, which can be found, for example, in Bollobás (1978), is somewhat technical. The rough statement is that the vertex set of any large graph can be partitioned into a constant number ofpieces of nearly equal size, so that the bipartite graphs between most pairs of pieces behave like random bipartite graphs. The strength of this lemma is that it appliesto any graph, providing a rough approximation of its structure that enables one to extract a lot of information about it. A typical application is that a graph with“few” triangles can be “well-approximated” by a graph with no triangles. More precisely, for any> 0 there

This innocent-k = 3 of Szemerédi’s theorem that was mentioned earlier.Tools from linear and multilinear algebra play an essential role in extremal combinatorics. The most fruitful technique of this kind, which is possibly also the simplest, is the so-called simplest form, the method can be described as follows.dimension argument. In its In order to bound the cardinality of a discrete structure A, one maps its elements to distinct vectors in a vec- tor space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), and proves that those vectors are linearly independent. It then follows that the size ofis at most the dimension of the vector space in ques-$A$ tion. An early application of this argument was foundby Larman, Rogers, and Seidel in 1977. They wanted to know how many points it was possible to find in Rn that determine at most two distinct differences. An exampleof such a system is the set of all points whose coordinates consist ofn-2 0 s and two 1 s. Notice, however, that these points all lie in the hyperplane of points whose coordinates add up to 2. So this actually provides us with an example in R$n - 1$. Therefore, we have a simple lower bound ofmatched this with an upper bound ofn(n + 1)/2. Larman, Rogers, \text{and Seidel}(n + 1)(n + 4)/2. They did this by associating with each point of such aset a polynomial inn variables, and by showing that these polynomials are linearly independent and all liein a space of dimension$(n + 1)(n + 4)/2$. \text{This has been} improved by Blokhuis tofindingn + 1 further polynomials that lie in the same(n+1)(n+2)/2. He did this by space in such a way that the augmented set of polynomials is still linearly independent. More applications of the dimension argument can be found in Graham, Grötschel, and Lovász (1995, chapter 31).Spectral techniques, that is, an analysis of eigenvectors and eigenvalues [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), have been used extensively in graph theory. The link comes through the notion of an adjacency matrix of a graph G. This is defined to be the matrix each pair of (not-necessarily-distinct) vertices$A \text{with entries a}^{u}$, vu andforvand, wherea =au, v0 otherwise. This matrix is symmetric, and= 1 if u and v are joined by an edge, therefore, by standard results in linear algebra, it hasreal eigenvalues and anu, v orthonormal basis [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) of eigenvectors. It turns out that there is a tight relationship between the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A and several structural properties of the graph G, and these properties can often be useful in the study of

572

various extremal problems. Of particular interest is thesecond largest eigenvalue of a regular graph. Suppose that every vertex of a graph vector for which every entry is 1 is easily seen to be an G has degree d. Then the eigenvector with eigenvalue eigenvalue. If all other eigenvalues have modulus muchd, and this is the largest smaller thanways like a randomd, then it turns out thatd-regular graph. In particular, the G behaves in many number of edges inside any set ofk of the vertices is roughly the same (provided would expect with a random graph. It follows easily thatk is not too small) as one any set of vertices that is not too big has many neigh-bors among the vertices outside that set. Graphs with the latter property are called have numerous applications in theoretical computer expanders [III.24](/part-03/expanders) and science. Constructing such graphs explicitly is not aneasy matter and was at one time a major open problem. Now, however, several constructions are known, basedon algebraic tools. See chapter 9 of Alon and Spencer (2000), and its references, for more details. of combinatorial objects such as partially ordered sets, The application of topological methods in the study graphs, and set systems has already become part of the mathematical machinery commonly used in combinatorics. An early example is Lovász’s proof of Kneser’sconjecture, mentioned in section 2.3. Another example is a result of which the following is a representative special case. Suppose you have a piece of string with 10 red beads, 15 blue beads, and 20 yellow beads on it. Then, no matter what order the beads come in, youcan cut the string in at most 12 places and place the resulting segments of beaded string into five piles, eachof which contains two red beads, three blue beads, and four yellow beads. The number 12 is obtained by multi-plying 4, the number of piles minus 1, by 3, the number of colors. The general case of this result was proved by Alon using a generalization of Borsuk’s theorem.Many additional examples of topological proofs appear in Graham, Grötschel, and Lovász (1995, chapter 34). 3 Probabilistic Combinatorics A wonderful development took place in twentieth-cen-tury mathematics when it was realized that it is sometimes possible to use probabilistic reasoning to prove mathematical statements that do not have an obvious probabilistic nature. For example, in the first half of the century, Paley, Zygmund, Erd ̋os, Turán, Shannon, and others used probabilistic reasoning to obtain strik-ing results in analysis, number theory, combinatorics,

and information theory. It soon became clear that theso-called probabilistic method is a very powerful tool for proving results in discrete mathematics. The early results combined combinatorial arguments with fairly elementary probabilistic techniques, but in recent yearsthe method has been greatly developed, and now it often requires one to apply much more sophisticated techniques. A recent text dealing with the subject is Alon and Spencer (2000). The applications of probabilistic techniques in discrete mathematics were initiated by Paul Erd ̋contributed to the development of the method moreos, who than anyone else. One can classify them into three groups. The first deals with the study of certain classes of random combinatorial objects, like random graphs or ran-dom matrices. The results here are essentially results in probability theory, although most of them are motivated by problems in combinatorics. A typical problemis the following: if we pick a graph “at random,” what is the probability that it contains a Hamilton cycle? lowing idea. Suppose you want to prove that a combi-The second group consists of applications of the folnatorial structure exists with certain properties. Thenone possible method is to choose a structure randomly (from a probability distribution that you are free to specify) and estimate the probability that it has the properties you want. If you can show that this probability is greater than 0, then such a structure exists. Surprisingly often it is much easier to prove this thanit is to give an example of a structure that works. For instance, is there a graph with large girth (meaning ithas no short cycles) and large chromatic number? Even if “large” means “at least 7,” it is very hard to come upwith an example of such a graph. But their existence is a fairly easy consequence of the probabilistic method. The third group of applications is perhaps the most striking of all. There are many examples of statements that appear to be completely deterministic (even when one is used to the idea of using probability to give existence proofs) but that nevertheless yield to probabilis-tic reasoning. In the remainder of this section we shall briefly describe some typical examples of each of these three kinds of application.

3.1 Random Structures

The systematic study of random graphs was initiatedby Erd ̋os and Rényi in 1960. The most common way of defining a random graph is to fix a probabilityp and

(Formally speaking, G(n, p)but one often talks about it as though it is a graph thatis not a graph but a probability distribution, has been produced in a random way.) Given any prop-erty, such as “contains no triangles,” we can study the probability that G(n, p) has that property. many properties of graphs “emerge very suddenly.”Some examples are “contains a Hamilton cycle,” “is A striking discovery of Erd ̋os and Rényi was that not planar,” and “is connected.” These properties areall monotone, which means that if a graph G has the property and you add an edge tograph still has the property. Let us take one of these G, then the resulting properties and definethe random graph G(n, p)f (p) has it. Because the prop-to be the probability that erty is monotone, f (p) increases as p increases. What Erd ̋increase happens in a very short time. That is, os and Rényi discovered was that almost all of thisf (p) is almost 0 for small rapidly and becomes almost 1.p and then suddenly changes very Perhaps the most famous and illustrative example of this swift change is the sudden appearance of the so-called giant component. Let us look at G(n, p) when pa bility all the connected components ofhas the form c/n. If c < 1, then with high prob-G(n, p) have size at most logarithmic inn. However, if c > 1, then G(n, p)ear in nalmost certainly has one component of size lin-(the giant component), while all the rest have logarithmic size. This is related to the phenomenon ofphase transitions in mathematical physics, which are discussed in probabilistic models of critical phenomena phase transition for a graph property that is “global,”[IV.25]. A result of Friedgut shows that the in a sense that can be made precise, is sharper than theone for a “local” property. Another interesting early discovery in the study of random graphs was that many of the basic parameters of graphs are highly “concentrated.” A striking example that illustrates what this means is the fact that, forany fixed value ofp and for most values of n, almost all graphs G(n, p) have the same clique number. That is, there exists somethat with high probability, whenr (depending onn is large, the cliquep and n) such number ofhold for all G(n, p)n, for continuity reasons, but in the excep-is equal to r . Such a result cannot tional cases there is still some number is almost certainly equal either tor such that the cliquer or to r + 1. In both cases, r \text{is roughly} 2 log n/ \log (1/p). The proof

of this result is based on the so-called method: one estimates the expectation and the variance second moment of the number of cliques of a given size contained in G(n, p), and applies well-known inequalities of Markov and chebyshev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894). is also highly concentrated. Its typical behavior for val-ues of The chromatic number of the random graphp that are bounded away from 0 was deter-G(n, p) mined by Bollobás. A more general result, in which allowed to tend to 0 asn →\infty, was proved by Shamir, p is Spencer, Łuczak, Alon, and Krivelevich. In particular, itcan be shown that for every$α <^{1} \text{and every integer}-$ valued function$r (n) < n^{α}$, there exists a function2 p(n)precisely such that the chromatic number ofr (n) almost surely. However, determining the G(n, p(n)) is precise degree of concentration of the chromatic num-ber of G(n, p), even in the most basic and important caseoccur with equal probability), remains an intriguingp =1 2 (in which all labeled graphs on n vertices open problem.Many additional results on random graphs can be found in Janson, Łuczak, and Ruci ́nski (2000).

3.2 Probabilistic Constructions

One of the first applications of the probabilistic methodin combinatorics was a lower bound given by Erd ̋os for the Ramsey number section 2.2. He proved that if R(k, k), which was defined in

$n (2^{1})^{-}(^{k}) < 1$, k

thenof the edges of the complete graph on R(k, k) > n. That is, there is a red/blue coloringn vertices such that no clique of sizeblue. Notice that the numberk is completely red or complete lyn =  2 k/2!satisfies the above inequality for allk ⩾3, so Erd ̋os’s result gives an exponential lower bound forple: if you color the edges randomly and independently, R(k, k). The proof is sim- then the probability that any fixed set ofall its edges of the same color is twice 2-k(k 2\text{vertices has}). Thus, the expected number of cliques with this property is

If this is less than 1, then there must be at leastoring for which there are no cliques with this property, one coland the result is proved. in the sense that it merely proves the existence ofsuch a coloring, but gives no efficient way of actually Note that this proof is completely nonconstructive, constructing one.

3.3 Proving Deterministic Theorems

Suppose that you color the integers withcall a set S multicolored if all k colors appear ink colors. Let us S. Straus conjectured that for everyk there is an m with the fol- lowing property: given any setis a coloring of the integers with S withk colors such that allm elements, there translates ofproved by Erd ̋$S$os and Lovász. The proof is probabilistic, are multicolored. This conjecture was and applies a tool called the Lovász local lemma, which, unlike many probabilistic techniques, allows one toshow that certain events hold with nonzero probability even when this probability is extremely small. the assertion of this lemma, which has numerous additional applications, is, roughly, that for any finite collection of “nearly independent” low-probability events, there is a positive probability that none of the events holds. Note that the statement of Straus’s conjecture has nothing to do with probability, and yet its proof relies on probabilistic arguments.A graph G is k-colorable, as we have said, if you can properly color its vertices withthat instead of trying to usek colors in total, you havek colors. Suppose now a separate list ofk colors for each vertex, and this time you want to find a proper coloring ofeach vertex gets a color from its own list. If you can G where always do so, no matter what the lists are, then call edk-choosable, and the smallest k for which GG isiskthe lists are the same, then one obtains a-choosable is called the choice number chk(G)-coloring,.

One might though using different lists ofkcolors for different vertices would make it easier to find a proper coloring than using the samek colors for all vertices. However, this turns out to be far from true. It can be proved thatfor any constantc there is a constant C such that any graph with average degree at leastber at leastc. Such a graph might easily be bipartite C has choice num- (and therefore have chromatic number 2), so it follows that ch(G) can be much bigger than χ(G). Somewhat surprisingly, the proof of this result is probabilistic. graph that arises in Ramsey theory. Its vertices areall the points in the plane, with two vertices joined An interesting application of this fact concerns a by an edge if and only if the distance between themis 1. The choice number of this graph is infinite, by the above result, but the chromatic number is known to be between 4 and 7.A typical problem in Ramsey theory asks for a substructure of some kind that is entirely colored withone color. Its cousin, discrepancy theory, merely asks that the numbers of times the colors are used are nottoo close to each other. Probabilistic arguments have proved extremely useful in numerous problems of this general kind. For example, Erd ̋os and Spencer proved that in any red/blue coloring of the edges of the com-plete graph K there is a subset V of vertices such that the difference between the number of red edges inside V^0 and the number of blue edges inside^n^0 V^0 is at leastcn^3^/^2, for some absolute constant c > 0. This problem is a convincing manifestation of the power of proba-bilistic methods, since they can be used in the other direction as well, to prove that the result is tight up toa constant factor. Additional examples of such results can be found in Alon and Spencer (2000). 4 Algorithmic Aspects and Future Challenges As we have seen, it is one matter to prove that a cer-tain combinatorial structure exists, and quite another to construct an example. A related question is whetheran example can be generated by means of an efficient algorithm [IV.20 §2.3](/part-04/computational-complexity), in which case we call it explicit ta nt because of the rapid development of theoret-. This question has become increasingly imporical computer science, which has close connections with discrete mathematics.

For example, explicit constructions oferror-correcting codes that are as good as random ones are of major interest inmation theory [VII.6](/part-07/reliable-transmission-of-information), and explicit constructions ofcoding and in for certain Ramsey-type colorings may have applications in derandomization [IV.20 §7.1.1](/part-04/computational-complexity) (the process of converting randomized algorithms into deterministic ones). good explicit construction is often very difficult.

Weshall look at these two questions in turn. satisfy if it is to count as a procedure for solving this problem are Two very obvious conditions that a method should finiteness —that the procedure should have a finite description (so, for example, one cannot simply look up the answer in an infinite list of integers and

their factorizations)—and N, it correctly tells you whether correctness N is prime.—that, for every There is also a third, more subtle, condition, which goes to the heart of what is meant by the word “algo-rithm.” It is that it should consist of simple steps. This is needed in order to rule out ridiculous “procedures”such as, “See whether Nhas any nontrivial factors; declare Nto be prime if and only if it does not.” The problem with this is that we cannot see, just like that, whether N has nontrivial factors. By contrast, all that the method of trial division asks of us is that we shoulddo basic arithmetic, such as increasing integers by 1, comparing them, and doing long division. Moreover, the procedures of basic arithmetic can be broken downinto yet simpler steps: for instance, it is possible to do long division by a succession of elementary operations applied to single digits at a time. In order to understand this simplicity condition better, and to prepare ourselves for a formal definition ofthe notion of algorithms, let us look at long division in slightly more detail. Suppose that you have a piece ofpaper in front of you and you want to divide 5 959 578 by 857. You will write the two numbers down, and then, as the calculation proceeds, you will write other num-bers as well. For instance, you may wish to start by writing out all the multiples of 857 up to 9$\times 857$. \text{At some} point early on you will probably find yourself compar-ing 5999$= 7 \times$857 with 5959: this you do by scanning the numbers from left to right and comparing individ-ual digits. In this case, a difference is first detected in the third digit. You then write 5142 (which is 6$\times 857)$ underneath the 5959, subtract (again by scanning num-bers from left to right and performing single-digit operations), write down the difference 817, “bring down”the next digit, 5, of 5 959 578, and repeat the process with the number 8175.At each stage in this calculation you are modifying the piece of paper in front of you. As you do so you need to keep track of which stage of the procedure youare at (whether you are writing out the initial table of multiples of 857, or seeing which one is the largest thatdoes not exceed another number, or subtracting one number from another, or bringing down a digit, etc.), and which symbols on the page you are currently deal-ing with. What is remarkable is that this information has aas the size of the input (that is, the two numbers to befixed size, in the sense that it does not increase divided) increases. local changes Therefore, the procedure can be regarded as makingto some “environment,” using repeated

applications of a fixed rule that does not depend onthe input. (This rule will typically have some internal structure, such as a list of simpler rules together with specifications of the circumstances under which they should be applied.) In general, this is what we mean bya computation: it modifies an environment by means of repeated applications of a fixed rule. The rule is usually referred to as an algorithm. Notice that this description applies to many scientific theories of dynamic evolution in nature (of weather, chemical reactions, or biological processes, for example). Thus, \text{these can beregarded as computational processes}, \text{of sorts}. \text{Some of these dynamical systems also demonstrate well thefact that simple}, \text{local rules can result in a very complex modification of the environment if they are iter}-\text{ated many times}.

(However, \text{it would take too long over each step to be practical for anything but the very simplestof computations}.) 1.2 \text{What Does an Algorithm Compute}? A \text{Turing machine converts a sequence of} 0 s and 1 \text{sinto another sequence of} 0 s and 1 s. \text{If we wish to use mathematical language to discuss this}, \text{then we needto give a name to the set of}$\\{0}$, 1\\ - sequences. \text{To be} precise, \text{we consider the set of all finite sequences of} 0 s and 1 s, \text{and we call this setwrite} I \text{for the set of all}\{0,1\}-\text{sequences of length} I. \text{It is also useful ton}. \text{Iffor instance}, \text{ifx is a sequence inn} x \text{is the string} 0100101, then I, \text{then we write} |x|\text{for its length}:|x| = 7. To say that a Turing machine converts a sequence of0 s and 1 s into another such sequence (if it halts) is to say that it naturally defines a function from I to I. If Mfunction, then we say thatis the Turing machine and M computesf M is the correspond in gf M. Thus, every function f: I \to I \text{gives rise to a com}- \text{putational task}, \text{namely that of computingf} . \text{We say that exists a Turing machinef is computable if this is possible}: \text{that is}, \text{if there} M \text{such that the corresponding} 577 functionf M \text{is equal to} f .

However, complexity theory deals only withthe insolubility of the halting prob computable functions, and studies which of these canbe computed efficiently. Using the notation we have just introduced, we can formally describe various different kinds of computa-tional tasks, of which two major examples are search problems problem is, informally speaking, to find a mathematical and decision problems. The aim of a search object with certain properties: for instance, one mightwish to find a solution to a system of equations, and this solution might not be unique. We can model this bymeans of a binary relation [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar)R on the set I: for a pairtion of problem instance(x, y) of strings inx Iif, we say thatx Ry. (This notation meansy is a valid solu- that common notation for the same thing isx is related to yin the way specified by(x, y)R; another$\in R$.) For example, we might let positive integers N andx and K, respectively, and say thaty be binary expansions ofx Ry nontrivial factor ofif and only if NNis a composite number and. Informally, this search problem K is a would be, “Find a nontrivial factor ofrithm that computes a certain function$N$.” Iff M: Iis an algo-$\to I$, then we say that M solves the search problem MR if f M (x) is a valid solution ofhas a solution. For example, it solves the search prob-x for every problem instance x that lem just defined if, for every composite number binary expansionx, f (x) is the binary expansion of a N with nontrivial factor$K of^{M}N$. in positive integers, but formally speaking an algorithm Notice that in the above example we were interested is a function of binary strings. This was not a problem, because there is a convenient and natural way to encode integers as binary strings—via their usual binary expan-sions. For the rest of this article, we shall feel free to blur the distinction between the mathematical objectswe wish to investigate and the strings we use to represent them in a computation. For instance, it is sim-pler to think of the algorithm M in the previous para- graph as computing a function the search problem if, for every composite number f M: N\to  N, and solving N, fre presentation of objects by strings is a rather succinct M (N) is a nontrivial factor of N. We stress that the one: it takes only N, so the number,\log N2 is exponentially larger than the N- bits to represent the number length of its representation.

Now let us turn to decision problems. These are simply problems where one is looking for a yes/no answer.The problem with which we opened this article—Is$N$ a prime number?—is a classic example of a decision problem. Notice that here and in the paragraph before last we are using the word “problem” in a slightly unusual way, to mean a general class of questions rather than just one. In this example, the question, “Is443 a prime number?” would be called an instance of the problem, “Is$N$a prime number?” Modeling decision problems is very simple: they are subsets of I. The idea is that a subset S of I consists of all the strings where the answer is yes. So if the prob-lem is to determine primality, then S would consist of all binary expansions of prime numbers, at least if we chose the obvious encoding of the problem. When dowe say that a machine M solves the decision problem S? We would like it to compute a functionf that says yes when the input That is, we say thatx belongs to M solves the problem S and says no otherwise.S if the asso- ciated function such thatf (x)f M=is a function from1 whenever x \in  SI to the setand f (x)\\{0=, 10\. . \1

2.3 Efficient Computation and$P$

Now we have ways of measuring the complexity of algo-rithms and computational tasks. But we have not yet addressed the question of when we should regard an algorithm asciently solvable. We shall propose a definition of effi-efficient, or a computational task as efficiency that seems somewhat arbitrary and then explain why it is in fact a surprisingly good one. If Mis an algorithm, then we regard it as efficient if and only if it This means that there are constants terminates in polynomial timec and k such. that the worst-case complexity inequality$T (n) ⩽ cn^{k}$. In other words, the time taken TMalways satisfies the by the algorithm is bounded above by a polynomial function of the length of the input string. It is not$M$ hard to convince yourself that the familiar methods for adding or multiplying twon-digit numbers termi-

nate in polynomial time, whereas trial division for pri-mality testing does not. Other familiar examples of tasks with efficient algorithms are putting a set of num-bers in increasing order, computing the determinant [III.15](/part-03/determinants) of a matrix (provided one uses row operations rather than substituting the entries directly into the formula), solving linear equations by Gaussian elimination, finding the shortest path in a given network, and more. Since we are interested in the intrinsic complexity of computational tasks, we now define such a task tobe efficiently computable if there is an efficient algorithm Mthat solves it. In our discussion of efficient computability, we shall focus on decision problems and consider the class of all decision problems that have efficient algorithms. Understanding it isof computational complexity theory. Here is a formalthe major goal definition. We shall use the following convenient piece of notation: ifthen M(x) is the output of M is a Turing machine andx. (Earlier we wrotex is an input, f (x) for this function.) Since we are considering decision problems,$M(x) \text{will be} 0 or 1$.M Definition. A decision problem S ⊆ I is solvable in polynomial timenating in polynomial time, such thatif there is a Turing machine$M(x) =M1 \text{if and}$, termi- only if$x \in S$. polynomial time is our first example of aclass The class of decision problems that are solvable in. It is denoted P. complexity ing the running time as a function of the input length, The asymptotic analysis of running time, i.e., est im at turns out to be crucial for revealing structure in thetheory of efficient computation. The choice of polynomial time as the standard for efficiency may seem arbitrary, and theories could be developed with other choices, but it has amply justified itself. The main reason for this is that the class of polynomials (or func-tions bounded above by a polynomial) is closed under various operations that arise naturally in computation. In particular, the sum, product, or composition of two polynomials is again a polynomial. This allows us, for example, to think of long division as a basic, one-step operation when we are investigating the efficiency of algorithms for primality testing. In fact, long division takes more than one step, but it is in P so the time it takes does not affect whether an algorithm that uses itis itself in P. In general, if we use the basic program- ming technique of subroutines, and if our subroutines

580

are in$P$, then we will preserve the efficiency of the algorithm as a whole.Almost all computer programs that are used in practice turn out to be efficient in this theoretical sense. Ofcourse, the converse is not true: an algorithm that runs in timen100 is a polynomial. However, this seems not to mat-n100 is completely useless despite the fact that ter. It is unusual to discover even an$n^{1}0 - \text{time algorithm}$ for a natural problem, and on the rare occasions whenthis happens, improvements to$n^{3} - or n^{2} - time$, which border on the practical, almost always follow.It is important to contrast P with the class EXP. A problem belongs to EXP if there is an algorithm that solves it in at most exp len gthn, where p is some polynomial. (Roughly speak-(p(n)) steps for any input of ing, EXP consists of problems that can be solved in exponential time: the polynomial tion more robust and less dependent on the precisepmakes the de fin i nature of encodings, etc.)If you use trial division to test the primality of a number have to do N with \sqrt{n Ndigits} in its binary expansion, then youlong-division calculations. Since \sqrt{N} is$about 2$ n/2, this is an exponential-time procedure. Expo- nential running time is considered blatantly and if the problem has no faster algorithm, then it is inefficient, deemed intractable. It is known (via a basic technique called diagonalization) that P ≠ EXP; further more, some problems in EXP really do require exponential time. Almost all problems and classes considered inthis paper can easily be shown to belong to EXP via trivial, “brute-force” algorithms such as the trial divi-sion just discussed: the main question will be whether much faster algorithms can be devised for them. 3 The P versus NP Question In this section we discuss the famous P versus NP question, which is usually formulated in terms of decision problems, but which also has an interpretation interms of search problems. We shall start with the latter.

3.1 Finding versus Checking

Can you rearrange the letters CHAIRMITTE to form an English word? To solve a puzzle like this, one has tosearch among many possibilities (all permutations of those letters), perhaps building up fragments of wordsand hoping that inspiration will strike. Now consider the following question: can the letters of CHAIRMITTE be rearranged to form the word “arithmetic”? It is veryeasy (if slightly boring) to check that the answer is yes.

Oris a solution. The at least, so it seems. But actually proving that search problems of this kind are hard is a famous unsolved problem, the P versus NP question. fact quite general and has a natural appeal to mathe-maticians, is the task of finding proofs for valid math-Another search problem with this quality, which is in ematical statements. Again it seems to be far easier tocheck that an argument is a valid proof than it is to find the argument in the first place. Since finding a proof is a process that requires considerable creativity (as, in amuch smaller way, is finding an anagram), the P ver- sus NP question is, in a sense, asking whether this kind of creativity can be automated.In section 3.2 we shall define the class NP formally. Informally, it corresponds to the set of all search prob-lems for which it is easy to check whether you have found what you are searching for. Another example ofsuch a problem is that of finding a factor of a large composite integerit is an easy task for you (or your computer) to verify N. If you are told that K is a factor, then that this is true: all you have to do is a single instanceof long division. ating theories to explain various natural phenomena)A vast number of problems in science (such as creand engineering (such as creating designs under vari-ous physical and economic constraints) have the same property that success is much easier to recognize than to achieve in the first place. This gives some indication of the importance of this class of problems.

3.2 Deciding versus Verifying

For the purposes of theoretical analysis, it is actually more convenient to define NP as a class of decision problems. For instance, consider the decision problem,“Is N composite?” What makes this a problem in$NP$ is that, wheneverof this fact. Such a proof consists of a factor of N is composite, there is a short proof N, and is easy to check that this proof is correct. That is, itis easy to devise a polynomial-time algorithm M that takes as input a pair(N, K) of positive integers and$outputs 1 ifwise$. If N is prime, then K is a nontrivial factor of M(N, K) = 0 for every N and 0 other-K, while ifsuch that N is composite there will always exist an integer M(N, K) = 1. Moreover, in this case the string K that encodes K will be at most as long as the string

In fact, recently it was proved that the problem of deter-mining whether a number N is composite belongs to P. (Further details can be found inber theory [IV.3 §2](/part-04/computational-number-theory).) However, we would like to know computational num whether for every problem in NP one can do much better than the trivial algorithm.

In other words, if there is a polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether proofs thatx \in  S are correct (as in the def- inition of polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether NP just given), does it follow that there is ax \in  S? where ain an alternative definition of the class1.

For instance, R might correspond to all pairs of integersa nontrivial factor of N. Then the corresponding search(N, K) such that K is problem, “Given a composite number Nfind a nontrivial factortion problem. In general, any such relation K,” is closely related to the integer factoriza-R gives rise to a search problem, “Given a string such that(x, y) belongs to R (if such ax, find a string$y$exists).” Now$y$ the P versus NPproblem asks the following: “Are all such search problems solvable in polynomial time?”If the answer is yes, then the mere fact that it can be checked in polynomial time whether factor of N would imply that such a factor could actu-K is a nontrivial ally be found in polynomial time.2 Similarly, the mere fact that a short proof of a mathematical statement existed would be enough to guarantee that it could be found in a short time by a purely mechanical process. The apparent difference between the difficulty of dis-covering solutions and the ease of checking them once discovered would be entirely illusory. believe that it is not the case. However, nobody has managed to prove it. So the big conjecture is that This would be very strange, and almost all experts P does not equal$NP$. That is, finding is harder than checking, and efficient verification procedures do not necessar-ily lead to efficient algorithms for decision problems. This conjecture is strongly supported by our intuition, which has been developed over many centuries of dealing with search and decision problems in a wide variety of human activities. Further empirical evidence in favorof the conjecture is given by the fact that there are literally thousands of NP problems, from many math- ematical and scientific disciplines, that are not known to be solvable in polynomial time, despite the fact that researchers have tried very hard to discover efficient procedures for solving them.The P ≠ NP conjecture is certainly the most impor- tant open problem in computer science, and one ofthe most significant in all of mathematics. Our later section on circuit complexity (section 5.1) is devotedto attempts to prove it. There we shall discuss some partial results and limits of the techniques used so far. determining whether a number is composite, no such algorithm isknown for actually finding its factors, and it is widely believed that no2. Despite the fact that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for efficient algorithm exists for this.

3.4 NP versus co NP

Another important class, known as co NP, is the class of complements of sets (or decision problems) in NP. For example, the problem “Isco NPbecause there is an efficient verification pro-$N$prime?” belongs to cedure for showing that a given positive integer not prime, namely, exhibiting some factors. Equiva-N is lently, the set of primes belongs to co NP because its complement belongs to Does NP equal co NPNP? That is, if you have an effi-. cient verification procedure for determining member-ship of a set S, do you also have one for determining nonmembership at least not necessarily. For instance, if a jumble of let-? Again, intuition would suggest not, or ters can be rearranged to form a word, then that word serves as a short demonstration. But suppose a jumbleof letters cannot be rearranged to form a word. One could demonstrate this by looking at all possible rear-range ments and noting that none of them is a word, but this is a very long demonstration and there does notseem to be a systematic way of finding a truly short one. relevant: to verify that a set of logical constraints is Here again intuition from mathematics is extremely mutually tions has in consistent no common root, or that a set of regions in, that a family of polynomial equaspace hasto verify the opposite (exhibiting a consistent valua-empty intersection seems far harder than tion, a common root, or a point that belongs to allthe regions).

First, \text{here is a famous problem in NP}, \text{called SAT}. \text{Consider the logical formula} (p ∨ q ∨ r ) ̄∧ (\bar{p}∨ q) ∧ (p ∨$\bar{q}∨ r ) ∧ ($\bar{p}∨ r ). ̄ Here, be true or false. The symbols “p, q, and r are propositions∨” and “, each of which can∧” stand for OR and AND, respectively, an$\bar{d}p$(read as “NOT-$p$”) is the proposition that is true if and only ifp is false. Then the first subformula Suppose now thatp is true, p ∨qqis true, and∨ $\bar{r}$ is true becauser is false. at least one ofcheck that all the other subformulas are true, whichp, q, an\bar{d}r is true. Similarly, one can means that the entire formula is true. We call our choice of truth values forfor the formula, and we say that the formula isp, q, and r a satisfying assignment satisfiable. A natural computation problem that arises is the following. SAT: given a propositional formula, is it satisfiable? In the example above, the formula was a conjunction of subformulas, called clauses. In their turn, these subformulas were disjunctions of propositions or their negations, which are called formulasφ , . . . , φ is the formula literals. (The conjunctionφ ∧ · · · ∧of someφ and$\text{their disjunction}1 is$ kφ^1 ∨ · · · ∨ φ^k.)^1^k 3 SAT: given a propositional formula that consists of a conjunction of clauses that contain at most three literals each, is the formula satisfiable? Notice that SAT and 3 SAT are in NP, since it is an easy matter to check whether a given truth assignment to the variables is a satisfying assignment for the formula.Let us now turn to a second problem in NP.

Notice with these two examples how surprising it is that they can be reduced in polynomial time to problems such as 3 SAT or 3-colorability. This is particularly true of the first, which has nothing to do with graphs or satisfiability of logical formulas.If P ≠ NP, then no NP-complete problem has a polynomial-time decision procedure. Consequently, the corresponding search problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Thus, a proof that a problem is NP-complete is often taken asproblem is hard: if we could solve it, then we could evidence that this also efficiently solve a multitude of other problems. But thousands of researchers (and tens of thousands ofengineers) have, over several decades, tried and failed to find such procedures. Sometimes it is possible to prove a fact about all sets in NPNP-completeness has more positive aspects as well.by establishing it only for some NP-complete set (and noting that polynomial-time reductions preserve the claimed property). Famous examples include the existence of “zero-knowledge proofs,” established firstfor 3-coloring (see section 6.3.2), and the so-called PCP theorem, established first for 3 SAT (see section 6.3.3). 5 Lower Bounds As we mentioned earlier, it is very much harder to prove that certain problemsit is to find efficient algorithms (when they exist). In this can not be solved efficiently than section, we shall survey some of the basic methods that have been developed for finding lower bounds for the complexity of natural computational problems.

we shall discuss results that say that no algorithm canrun in fewer than a given number of steps. In particular, we shall introduce the theories of circuit complexity with the long-term goal of proving thatand proof complexity.

The circuit model of computation is finite rather than infinite, which raises an issue calledwe build a family of circuits from a Turing machine, uniformity.

A uniform family of circuits is one that can be generated in this way. form. Indeed, there are functions However, by no means all families of circuits are uni-f that cannot be com- puted by Turing machines at all (let alone in a reason-able amount of time), despite having circuits of linear size. This extra power comes from the fact that these families of circuits do not have a succinct (“effective”) description; that is, there is no single algorithm that can generate them. Such families are called nonuniform. from Turing machines, then it would seem that prov-If there are many families of circuits that do not arise ing good lower bounds for circuit complexity shouldbe much harder than proving lower bounds for Turing complexity, since now one must rule out many more potential ways of computing a function. However, thereis a strong sentiment that the extra power provided by nonuniformity is irrelevant to the P versus NP ques- tion: it is believed that for a natural problem such as 3 Sat another big conjecture of theoretical computer science:, nonuniformity does not help.

In particular, do there exist linear-size circuits for multiplication? nontrivial bounds are known for any explicit functions?How can circuit complexity be a thriving subject if no The answer is that there have been some remarkable successes in proving lower bounds under natural extra assumptions on the circuits. We shall now describe the most important of these extra assumptions.

5.1.2 Monotone Circuits

As we have seen, general Boolean circuits can compute every Boolean function, and can do it at least as efficiently as general algorithms. Now some functions have additional properties that might lead one to expect that they could be computed with Boolean circuits of a particular kind. For example, consider the function CLIQUEis a graph with, defined on the set of all graphs as follows. Ifn vertices, then a clique in Gis defined G to be a set of vertices such that any two are joined by an edge. Let us definea clique of size at least CLIQUE\sqrt{n} and 0 otherwise.(G) to be 1 if G contains Notice that if we add an edge to G, then either Clique what it will(G) changes from 0 to 1 or it stays the same.notdo is change from 1 to 0: adding an edge obviously cannot We can encode G as a string destroy xa clique.ofn bits, one for each pair of vertices, assigning 1 to a bit if the correspond-ing pair of vertices is joined by an edge and 0 other-2 wise.

Boolean functions with monotone. tions, it is extremely natural to restrict the circuits by When considering the complexity of monotone func allowing only AND and OR gates, and disallowing NOTgates. Notice that “∧” and “∨” are monotone operations, in the sense that changing an input bit from 0 to 1 will not change the output of the gate from 1 to 0, whereas “¬” is certainly not monotone in this sense. A circuit that uses just “∧” and “∨” is called a monotone circuit functionf . It is not hard to show that every monotone: I\to  I can be computed by a monotone circuit, and that almost all monotone functions need exponential-sized circuits.nm ier to prove lower bounds? For over forty years theanswer seemed to be not much: nobody could prove a Does the extra restriction on the circuits make it eassuper-polynomial lower bound for the monotone com-plexity of any explicit monotone function. But then, in 1985, a new technique called the approximation method was invented to prove the remarkable theorem that CLIQUE has super-polynomial monotone complexity. This technique eventually led to the following even stronger result. Theorem.nential size.CLIQUE requires monotone circuits of expoworks as follows. Assume that Very roughly speaking, the approximation method CLIQUE can be computed with a small monotone circuit. Then replace the occurrences of “∧” and “∨” in this circuit with other gates that are cleverly chosen (and complex todescribe), denoting these by “ ̃∧” and “ ̃∨,” respectively. The new gates are chosen to satisfy two key properties. (i) Replacing one particular gate has only a “small”effect on the output of the circuit (where “small” is defined in terms of a certain natural but nontrivial measure of distance).

If Fis a field, then we can consider a DAG in which the inputs are now elements of$F$and the gates are the field operations “$+$” and “$\times$” (including multiplication by fixed field elements suchas-1). Then, just as with Boolean circuits, once we know the inputs we can assign values to all verticesof the DAG: at each vertex one just applies the corresponding arithmetical operation to the values assignedto its predecessors, once these have been calculated. An arithmetic circuit computes a polynomial function$p$:$F^{n} \to F^{m}$, and every homogeneous polynomial func- tion is computed by some circuit. To allow the compu-tation of in homogeneous polynomials, we augment the model by allowing a special input vertex whose value is the constant “1” of the field. mialtions and one addition, can be computed by the circuit Let us consider a couple of examples.

We do not count multiplication by a fixed field elementas contributing to the size of a circuit: for example, when we said that(x + y)(x - y) \text{involves one mul}- tiplication, we were not counting the multiplication ofy by -1. The reader may wonder about division. How- ever, we will be mainly interested in computing poly-nomials, and for computing polynomials (over infinite fields) division can be efficiently emulated by the other operations.

A simple dimension argument shows that for mostd polynomials p, S(p) is proportional to d. However, we know of no explicit polynomial with this everymany circuits of size 2). Instead, a “dimension” argument is used,4.

Now let us return to polynomials with convenient to maken our only input size parameter, n variables. It is so we shall restrict ourselves to polynomials of total degree at mostn, even when we do not mention this restriction.For almost every polynomialp in n variables, S(p) is at least exp(n/2). Again, this follows from an easy dimension argument, but again we would like to find explicit (families of) polynomials that are hard to compute. Unlike in the Boolean world, here there are lower bounds that slightly exceed the trivial ones. The fol-lowing theorem is proved using elementary tools from algebraic geometry.

Outstanding candidates for the latter are the linear maps that compute the discrete Fourier transform overthe complex numbers or the Walsh transform over the rationals. For both these transformations algorithms oftime complexity$O(n \log n) \text{are known}$.

The most natural and well-studied candi-date for the last open problem is Now let us focus on specific polynomials of central matrix multiplication [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions): given two$m \times m matrices A$, B, how many operations are needed to compute their product?The obvious algorithm, which follows from the definition of matrix product, requires about$m^{3} operations$. Can this be beaten? It turns out that what really mat-ters here is the number of multiplications. The first hint that one can improve on the obvious algorithm comes from the first nontrivial case (i.e.,$m = 2)$. While the usual algorithm uses eight multiplications, one canin fact reorganize the calculation and get away with only seven. This leads to a recursive argument: givena 2 m \times  2 m matrix, think of it as a 2 \times  2 matrix, each entry of which is itself anm \times m matrix. \text{It follows} that doubling the size of the matrix increases the num-ber of multiplications needed by a factor of at most 7. This argument leads to an algorithm with only$m \lo(g^{2})^{7}$ multiplications (and roughly as many additions). yield the following strong, but not quite linear, upper bound, where we denote by These ideas have been developed and extended to$n = m^{2} \text{the natural input}$ size, and by MM the matrix multiplication function.

5.3 Proof Complexity

The concept ofall other fields of human inquiry. Mathematicians haveproof distinguishes mathematics from gathered millennia of experience to attribute such adjectives to proofs as “insightful,” “original,” “deep,” and, most notably, “difficult.” Can one quantify math-ematically the difficulty of proving various theorems? This is exactly the task under taken in proof complexity.It seeks to classify theorems according to the difficulty of proving them, much as circuit complexity seeks toclassify functions according to the difficulty of computing them. In proofs, just as in computation, there will bea number of models, called proof systems, that capture the power of reasoning that is allowed to the prover. shall deal with are best illustrated by the following The types of statements, theorems, and proofs we example.

Here are a few possibilities which differ from each other in a number of ways. • The standard proof uses symmetry and induction.It reduces PHPm to PH(Pm)-1 by saying that once the first pigeon has been assigned a hole, the task thatis left is to place the remaining$(n^{n})^{-1} n - 1 \text{pigeons intomthe}-$ first1 holes.

good sense to begin by considering simpler (and thus weaker) proof systems before moving on to more and To start attacking this formidable problem it makes more complex ones. Moreover, there are tautologies and proof systems that naturally suggest themselves as good ones to study, systems in which certain basic forms of reasoning are allowed while others are not. In the rest of this section we shall focus on some of these restricted proof systems.If a typical proof in a branch of mathematics such as algebra, geometry, or logic is written out in full, then itstarts with some axioms and proceeds to a conclusion using a set of very simple and transparent rules. Each line of the proof consists of a mathemat-deduction ical statement, or formula, which follows from earlier statements by means of one of these rules.8 This deductive approach goes right back to euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) and perfectly fits our DAG model: the inputs can be labeledby the axioms, every other vertex is assigned a deduction rule, and the statement associated with each vertex this formalism, by considering a deduction rule that corresponds to asingle step of the machine8. General proof systems as we defined them can also be adapted to M. However, the deduction rules considered below are even simpler, and more importantly they are natural.

These encapsulate the idea of a proof by contradiction. We assume the negation ofthe tautology T we wish to prove, and use the rules of the system to derive a contradiction—that is, a state-ment that is identically FALSE. It is often easy to write the negation of a tautology ally contradicting formulas (e.g., a set of clauses with T as a conjunction of mutu- no common truth assignment, a system of polynomials with no common root, a collection of half-spaces with empty intersection, etc). Assuming, for a contradiction, that all these are simultaneously satisfiable by someσ (which could be an assignment, root, or point, respec-tively), we derive more and more formulas that must also be satisfied by derivation rules, until eventually we reach a blatant con-σ because of the soundness of the tradiction (such as¬x ∧ x$, 1 = 0, or 1 < 0, respec-$ tively). We will use the refutation viewpoint through-out, and often exchange “tautology” and its negation, “contradiction.”So we turn to studying the proof length L (T ) of tau- to log i es which reveals a major difference between proof com-T in proof systems Π.

Thus, in proof complexity, even one, would be of interest. As we shall see, however, most known lower bounds (in restricted proof systems) apply to very natural tautologies.

The proof systems in this section will all have lines thatare Boolean formulas. The differences between the systems will be in the structural limits that are imposedon these formulas. puts no restriction on the formulas manipulated by the The most basic proof system, called the Frege system, proof. It has just one derivation rule, called thefrom the two formulas(A ∨C), (B ∨ ¬C) we can derivecut rule: A ∨ B. Different basic books in logic have slightly different ways of describing this system. However, froma computational perspective they are all equivalent, in the sense that (up to polynomial factors) the lengthof the shortest proofs is independent of which variant you pick.

6 Randomized Computation

Up to now, the computations we have considered haveall been deterministic: that is, the output is completely determined by the inputs and the rules governing the computations. In this section we shall continue to focuson polynomial-time computations, but now we shall allow our computing devices to make probabilistic, or randomized, choices.

6.1 Randomized Algorithms

A famous example of such an algorithm is one that testsfor primality. If N is the positive integer to be tested, then the algorithm randomly chooses than N, and repeatedly performs a simple test usingk numbers less each of the chosen numbers in turn. If N is composite, then the probability that the test detects this is at least3. Therefore, the probability that the algorithm fails to detect it for any of the4 k \text{numbers is at most} (1 4)k, which is very small indeed for even modestly large val-ues ofk. Details of how the test works can be found in computational number theory [IV.3 §2](/part-04/computational-number-theory). It is not hard to give a rigorous definition of a randomized Turing machine, but we shall not need the precise details here. The main point is that if M is a randomized Turing machine andx is an input string, thendom variable M(x)is not a fixed output string, but rather a[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions). If, for example, the output israna single bit, then we shall make statements such as,“The probability that M(x) = 1 is p.” The actual value ofmade by the machine M(x) will depend on the particular random choices M when it runs. If we are using a randomized algorithm to solve a decision problem correct answer with high probability S, then we would like whatever the input M(x) to give thex This leads to the definition of the complexity class. (The correct answer is 1 if x \in S and 0 otherwise.)BPP (\text{for bounded error}, \text{probabilistic polynomial time}). Definition (BPP).

Open problem. Does$P = BPP$? time algorithm was recently discovered for primality As we mentioned earlier, a deterministic polynomial testing, though in practice the randomized algorithmis much more efficient. However, there are quite a few problems11 that are known to be in BPP but not known to be in P. Indeed, for most of these problems random- ness gives an exponential improvement over the best deterministic algorithms that are known. Is this evi-dence that randomness increases our power to solve decision problems? Surprisingly, a completely different kind of evidence (discussed in section 7.1) suggests the opposite, namely that$P$ = BPP.

6.2 Counting at Random

One important general question regarding NP search problems is that of determining particular instance has. This includes a host of inter-how many solutions a esting problems from various disciplines: for example, counting the number of solutions to a system of multivariate polynomials, counting the number of perfect matchings of a graph (or, equivalently, computing the permanent of a$\\{0}$,1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} matrix), computing the volume of a polytope (defined by linear inequalities) in high dimension (see [I.4 §9](/part-01/general-goals) for more about this problem), computing various parameters of physical systems, etc.For most of these problems, even approximate counting is good enough. Clearly, an approximate count ofthe number of solutions will in particular allow one to circuit over11. A central example is Q, decide if it computes the identically zero polynomial.Identity Testing: given an arithmetic

1. This tells us whether the formula is satisfiable and solves an instance ofalso true: if one can solve SAT. Interestingly, the converse is SAT, then one can use this ability to produce a randomized algorithm for approximating thestant factor greater than 1. More precisely, there is annumber of solutions, to within any con efficient probabilistic algorithm that can produce such an approximate count if it is allowed to make free useof a subroutine that solves SAT instances. It turns out that analogous statements holds for all NP-complete problems. done nomial-time probabilistic algorithms for approximat-For some problems, approximate counting can bewithout the SAT subroutine. There are polying the permanent of positive matrices, approximating the volume of polytopes, and more. These algorithms use a connection between approximate counting and another natural algorithmic problem: that of randomly generating a solution in such a way that all correct solutions are equally likely to occur. The basic technique is to construct a Markov chain on the space of solutions with uniform stationary distribution and to analyze the rate of convergence of the chain to this distribution (see Hochbaum 1996, chapter 12). can not even if it can make free use of a What aboutbe done by an efficient probabilistic algorithm, exact counting? It is believed that this SAT subroutine. A remarkable “complete” problem for this class of count-ing problems is counting the number of perfect matchings in a graph. What is surprising about it is that there is an efficient algorithm for finding a perfect matchingin a graph, if one exists, and yet counting such matchings is complete in the sense that an efficient algorithm for doing this can be turned into an efficient algorithm for the counting version of any other problem in NP.

6.3 Probabilistic Proof Systems

As we saw earlier, proof systems are defined in termsof their verification procedure. In section 5.3, we considered verification procedures that run in time thatis polynomial in the combined length of the assertion and its alleged proof. Here (as in section 3.2), we restrict our attention to verification procedures that run in time that is polynomial in the length of the assertion. Suchproof systems are related to the class NP, since sets S

While it is not known if NP ≠ PSPACE, it is widely believed to be the case, and so it seems that interactive proofs are much more powerful than standard noninteractive and deterministic proofs (that is, NP-proofs).

6.3.2 Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems

A typical mathematical proof not only guarantees the truth of a statement, but alsoabout it. In this section we shall discuss a kind of proof teaches you something that teaches you absolutely nothing, beyond the factthat the statement is true. Since this seems impossible, let us give an example.Suppose a prover wants to convince you that a certain map (in the geography sense) can be colored withthree colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions have the same color. The most obvious approach isactually to show you a coloring, but this teaches you something—a particular coloring—which you wouldnot otherwise be able to find easily, even knowing that it existed (since this search problem is NP-complete).Is there any way the prover can convince you without giving you this extra knowledge?Here is a way of doing it. Given any coloring of the map, with red, blue, and green, say, one can produce other colorings by permuting the colors: for instance, one might change all the red regions into blue and all the blue ones into red. Let the prover take six copies ofthe map and color them in six different ways, one for each permutation of the three colors. Now we have asequence of rounds. In each round the prover randomly chooses one of the six colored maps, you randomly choose a pair of adjacent regions, and the prover allows you to check that they have different colors, not allow you to look at the rest of the map. If the graphbut does cannot be properly colored with three colors and theprover tries to cheat, then after enough rounds (a polynomial number suffices) you will discover the deceptionby hitting upon two adjacent regions that have been given the same color (or perhaps one of them has notbeen colored at all). However, at each stage, all you learn about the two regions you look at is that they have dif-ferent colors—you have no idea what those colors are

598

in the coloring the prover started with. So you end upwith no knowledge beyond the fact that the map can (almost certainly) be properly colored. mula is satisfiable should not reveal a satisfying assign-Similarly, a “zero-knowledge proof” that a certain forment, or even any partial information (such as the truth value of one of the variables), or irrelevant information that is hard to compute (such as how to factorize aninteger that happens to be encoded by the formula). In general, a zero-knowledge proof is an interactive proof that does not help you (the verifier) to make put at i ons that you were not able to make efficiently any com already. ously, if the verifier can determine the answer with nohelp, then the theorem has a trivial zero-knowledge Which theorems have zero-knowledge proofs? Obviproof, in which the prover does nothing at all. Thus, any set in BPP has a zero-knowledge proof. The zero-knowledge proof outlined for depended on non computational procedures, such as3-colorability the prover watching carefully to make sure that you just look at two regions. Implementing the protocolin full on a computer takes some care, but a method of doing it has been devised, which depends on the hardness of integer factorization. The result is a zeroknowledge proof system completeness of 3-colorability. Combining this with the NP-, one can prove that zero-knowledge proof systems exist for NP. More generally, we have the following theorem.every set in Theorem.\text{in section} 7), then every set in If one-way functions exist (these are defined NP has a zero-knowl- edge proof system. Moreover, this proof system can be efficiently derived from the standard NP proof. This theorem has a dramatic effect on the design of cryptographic protocols (see section 7.2). Further more, under the same assumption, an even stronger result holds: any set that has an interactive proof system alsohas a zero-knowledge interactive proof system.

6.3.3 probabilistic ally Checkable Proofs

In this section we turn to one of the deepest and most surprising discoveries about the power of probabilistic proofs. Here, as in the case of standard (noninteractive) proofs, the verifier receives a complete written proof.The catch is that the verifier may read only a very small, randomly selected, part of this proof. eeing a paper and trying to decide the correctness A good analogy is to imagine that you are refer-

of a long proof by reading just a few random lines.If the proof has a single (but crucial) mistake, then you will probably not read the relevant line so youwill not notice the mistake. But this is true only for the “natural” way of writing down proofs. It turnsout that there are ways of writing proofs “robustly” (with a certain amount of redundancy) so that any mis-take will manifest itself in many different places. (This may remind you of There is indeed an important analogy here, and cross-error-correcting codes [VII.6](/part-07/reliable-transmission-of-information). fer til ization between the two areas has been very sig-nificant.) Such a robust proof system is called a PCP, which stands for “probabilistic ally checkable proof.”Loosely speaking, a PCP system for a set S con- sists of a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier who has access to individual bits in a string that represents the(alleged) proof.

7.1 Pseudo randomness

What is randomness? When should we say that a mathe-matical or physical object behaves randomly? These are fundamental questions that have been thought aboutfor centuries. When the objects are probability distributions, onone point at least: then-bit sequences, say, there is consensus about uniform distribution (in which eachn-bit string appears with probability 2-n) is “the most random” one. More generally, it seems reasonable to say that any distribution that is statistically close to the uniform distribution should also be regarded ashaving “good randomness” properties.14 plexity theory is that there are distributions that are extremely far from the uniform distribution, but which One of the great insights of computational comare nevertheless “effectively random.” The reason isthat they are computationally in distinguishable from the uniform distribution. domly sample ability distribution Let us try to formalize this idea.

In that case, we say no efficiently computable that Pn is pseudorandom. refers to any efficient procedure that may be employedin an attempt to tell two distributions apart. And it is This definition is both general and pragmatic. It pragmatic because for any practical purpose a pseudo-random distribution is as good as a random one, for reasons we shall now explain. listic algorithm will be virtually unaffected if we replace its random source with a pseudorandom one. Why?Notice first that the behavior of any efficient probabi Because if its behavior changed, then the algorithm itself would have efficiently distinguished between the random and pseudorandom sources, contradicting the definition of pseudo randomness!Replacing uniform distributions by pseudorandom distributions is beneficial provided we can generate the latter using fewer resources. In this context, there source we are trying hardest to save on is randomness. Suppose we have an efficiently computable func-tionφ: I\to  I and suppose that n > m. Then we can define a probability distribution onby choosing a randommn m-bit string x and computingn-bit stringsφ(x). If this distribution is pseudorandom, then φ is called ais called the pseudorandom generator seed, and if the generator stretches. The random stringm-bitx long seeds into strings of length$n = (m)$, then we call the function the stretch measure of the generator. The larger the stretch measure, the better the generator is considered to be. pseudorandom generators exist? It is to this question that we now turn.Of course, all this raises an important question: Do

7.1.1 Hardness versus Randomness

There is an obvious connection between pseudoran-dom generators and computational difficulty, since the main property of a pseudorandom generator is that itsoutput should be computationally hard to distinguish from a purely random string, even though the two distributions are significantly different. However, there isa much less obvious connection as well.

Further more, if pseudo-Pseudorandom generators exist if and only random generators exist then they exist for any stretch measure that is a polynomial.15 hardness th er more, its proof links computational in distinguish a-This theorem converts computational difficulty, or, into pseudo randomness, and vice versa. Furbility to computational un predict ability, hinting thatthe computational difficulty is linked to randomness, or at least to the appearance of randomness.The existence of pseudorandom generators has the remarkable consequence that probabilistic algorithms can be partially or even wholly derandomized. The basic idea is this. Suppose you have a probabilistic algorithm that computes a functionf and requires nc random bits (wherethat this algorithm outputsn denotes the length of the input). Supposef (x) with probability at leastrandom23. If you replace the random bits withbits, generated from a seed of sizemn, \text{then the}c pseudo- behavior of the algorithm will hardly be affected.

But this means we can compute taking a majority vote!f (x)deterministical ly and efficiently by to achieve the ultimate derandomization result, that$BPP = P$Can this actually be done? Can we use hardness? The theory has developed to give essentially optimal answers to this question. Notice that ifwe wish to achieve an exponential stretch measure, we do not mind if the algorithm that performs the stretch takes exponential time (in the length of the seed). Such pseudorandom generators exist under very plau-sible hardness assumptions, such as the assumption that NP-complete problems require exponential-size Boolean circuits. More generally, we have the following theorem. Theorem. If, for some constant$> 0$, S(SAT) > 2 n, \text{then problem computable in BPP} = P. Moreover,2 O(n)SAT-time.can be replaced by any

7.2 Cryptography

Cryptography has existed for millennia, but whereas in the past it was focused on one basic problem—that of providing secret communications—the modern computational theory of cryptography is interested inall tasks that involve several agents who each wish to obtain some information while preserving the secrecyof other information. An important priority besides privacy (that is, keeping secrets) is resilience: one would like guaranteed privacy even if one is not certain thatthe other participants are behaving honestly. ing a game of poker over the telephone or e-mail. Youare encouraged to ponder seriously how this might A good example to illustrate these difficulties is playbe done, and realize to what extent standard poker relies on human vision, physical implements like cards with opaque backs, etc., to protect privacy and prevent cheating. schemes, called functionality (rules, privacy requirements, etc.), even in The general goal of cryptography is to construct protocols, that maintain any desired the face of malicious attempts to make them deviate from this functionality. As with pseudo randomness, there are two key assumptions underlying the newtheory. First, it is assumed that all parties, including the malicious adversaries, are computationally limited.Second, it is assumed that there are hard functions. Sometimes these are one-way functions, and sometimes they are yet stronger functions called “trapdoor permutations,” which also exist if integer factorization is hard. achieved. There is a result that says, roughly speaking, This goal is an ambitious one, but it has been that every functionality can be securely implemented.

This includes highly complex tasks such as playing poker over the phone, but also very basic ones such as secure communication, digital signatures (a digital analogue of handwritten signatures), collective coin flip-ping, auctions, elections, and the famous millionaires’ problem who is richer, without either of them learning anything: how can two people interact to determine further about the other’s wealth? tography and matters that we have already discussed.First of all, consider the very definition of the central Let us very briefly hint at connections between crypnotion of cryptography: that of an-bit string, then when should we say that it is com-secret. If you have an pletely secret? A natural definition would be that it issecret if nobody else has any information about it: that is, from anybody else’s point of view it is equally likelyto be any of the 2 n-bit strings. However, in the new com- putational complexity theory, this is not the definition taken, since apractical purposes, be just as secret.pseudo ran do mn-bit string will, for all is huge. The point of cryptography is not just to have secrets (that is easy, just select a string at random) but The difference between the two definitions of a secret actually to At first this seems impossible, since any nontrivial useuse them without giving away information. of a secretsible strings that it might be, and therefore give awayn-bit string will cut down the set of pos- genuine information. However, if the new probability distribution over the possible strings (after the infor-mation has been given away) is pseudorandom, then this information cient algorithm can tell the difference between a string cannot feasibly be used, since no effithat gives rise to the information you have revealed and a truly random string.A famous example of this idea is given by the socalled which are described in detail inpublic-key encryption schemes mathematics and, such as RSA, cryptography [VII.7](/part-07/mathematics-and-cryptography) and in Goldreich (2004, chapter 5). In the RSA scheme, if a user, say Alice, wantsto receive messages, she publishes a number N, called a If you know public key, which is a product of two primes N then you can encrypt any message, but P and Q. to decrypt it you need to know P and Q. Thus, if inte- ger factorization is hard, then only Alice can feasibly decrypt messages, even though P and Q are completely determined by The generic problem about using secrets is one in N. which there arek parties, and each party has a string of bits. They are interested in the value of some efficiently computable functionf that depends on all the strings

of bits, but they would like to ascertain this without giving away any information about their own strings beyond what follows from the value off . For example, in the case of the millionaires’ problem, there are two parties, each with a string that encodes their wealth. They would like a protocol that provides them with a single bit that tells them who is richer, but gives themno information beyond this. The precise formulation of this condition is an extension of the formulation ofzero-knowledge proofs (presented in section 6.3.2). As hinted at earlier in this section, assuming the existenceof trapdoor permutations, every such multiparty computation can be performed without yielding anything beyond the designated outputs Finally, we come to the issue of cheating. In the fore-. going discussion, we did not worry about malicious behavior and focused on what participants may learn from the transcript of their interaction. But how can aplayer, Bob, say, be forced to act “as specified,” when his actions may depend partly on his secrets, which hedoes not want to reveal? The answer is closely related to zero-knowledge proofs. Essentially, each player whoseturn it is to perform some computation is asked to prove to the others that he has acted as specified. Thisis a (mathematically boring) theorem and the standard proof is obvious (i.e., revealing all his secrets). But as we saw in our discussion of zero-knowledge proof systemsin section 6.3.2, if a proof exists, then a zero-knowledge proof can be efficiently derived from it. Thus, can convince the others of his proper behavior without Bob revealing anything about his secrets. 8 The Tip of an Iceberg Even within the topics reviewed above, many important notions and results have not been discussed, for space reasons. Further more, other important topics and even wide areas have not been mentioned at all.The P versus NP question, as well as most of the discussion so far, focuses on a simplified view of thegoals of (efficient) computations. Specifically, we have insisted on efficient procedures thatexact answer. However, in practice one may be con-always give the tent with less. For example, one may be happy with an efficient procedure that gives the correct answerfor a large fraction of the instances. This will be useful if all instances are equally interesting, but that istypically not the case. On the other hand, demanding success under all input distributions gives backworst-case complexity.

This can mean many things, and the bestnotion of approximation varies from context to context.

This is arguably the most important com-plexity measure, but it is not the only one. Another is In this article we have focused on the running time of the amount oftation (see Sipser 1997). Another important issue is thework space consumed during the compuextent to which a computation can be performed in par-allel; that is, speeding up the computation by splitting the work among several computing devices, which are viewed as components of the same (parallel) machine and are provided with direct access to the same memory module. In addition to the parallel mentally important complexity measure in such a casetime, a fundais the number of parallel computing devices used (see Karp and Ramachandran 1990).Finally, there are several computational models that we have not discussed here. Models ofputing refer to distant computing devices, each given distributed coma local input, which may be viewed as a part of a global input. In typical studies one wishes to min-imize the amount of communication between these devices (and certainly avoid the communication of theentire input). In addition to measures of communication complexity, a central issue is asynchrony (see Attiya and Welch 1998). Theity of two-argument (and many-argument) functions is communication complexa measure of their “complexity” (see Kushilevitz and Nisan 1996), but in these studies communication proportional to the length of the input is not ruled out (but rather appears frequently). While being “informa-tion theoretic” in nature, this model has many connections to complexity theory. Altogether different typesof computational problems are investigated in the context of computational learning theory (see Kearns and Vazirani 1994) and ofand El-Yaniv 1998). Finally, online quantum computation algorithms (see Borodin

Trefethen 1 The Need for Numerical Computation Everyone knows that when scientists and engineers need numerical answers to mathematical problems, they turn to computers. Nevertheless, there is a widespread misconception about this process.The power of numbers has been extraordinary. It is often noted that the scientific revolution was set inmotion when Galileo and others made it a principle that everything must be measured. Numerical measure-ments led to physical laws expressed mathematically, and, in the remarkable cycle whose fruits are all around us, finer measurements led to refined laws, which inturn led to better technology and still finer measurements. The day has long since passed when an advancein the physical sciences could be achieved, or a significant engineering product developed, without numerical mathematics.Computers certainly play a part in this story, yet there is a mis understanding about what their role is.Many people imagine that scientists and mathematicians generate formulas, and then, by inserting num-bers into these formulas, computers grind out the necessary results. The reality is nothing like this. What

really goes on is a far more interesting process of exe-cution of algorithms. In most cases the job could not be done even in principle by formulas, for most mathe-matical problems cannot be solved by a finite sequence of elementary operations. What happens instead isthat fast algorithms quickly converge to “approximate” answers that are accurate to three or ten digits of pre-cision, or a hundred. For a scientific or engineering application, such an answer may be as good as exact. approximate solutions by an elementary example. Sup-pose we have one polynomial of degree 4, We can illustrate the complexities of exact versus $p(z) = c0 + c1z + c2z2 + c3z3 + c4z4$, \text{and another of degree} 5, q(z) = d0 + d1 z + d2 z2 + d3 z3 + d4 z4 + d5 z5.

Thus, in a cer-the insolubility of tain philosophical sense the root-finding problems forp and qare utterly different. Yet in practice they hardly differ at all. If a scientist or a mathematician wants toknow the roots of one of these polynomials, he or she will turn to a computer and get an answer to sixteen digits of precision in less than a millisecond. Did the computer use an explicit formula? In the case ofthe answer is certainly no, but what about$p$? Maybe, q, maybe not.

Can we conclude that (i)–(iii) will be easier than (iv)–(viii)in practice? Absolutely not. Problem (iii) is usually very hard indeed if Problems (vi) and (vii) are usually rather easy, at leastn is, say, in the hundreds or thousands. if the integral is in one dimension. Problems (i) and (iv) are of almost exactly the same difficulty: easy whenis small, like 100, and often very hard whenn is large, n like 1 000 000. In fact, in these matters philosophy issuch a poor guide to practice that, for each of the three problems (i)–(iii), when ignores the exact solution and uses approximate (butn and m are large one often fast!) methods instead.Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms for solving the problems of continuous mathematics, bywhich we mean problems involving real or complex variables. (This definition includes problems like lin-ear programming and the traveling salesman problem posed over the real numbers, but not their discrete ana-logues.) In the remainder of this article we shall review some of its main branches, past accomplishments, and possible future trends. 2 A Brief History Through out history, leading mathematicians have been involved with scientific applications, and in many cases this has led to the discovery of numerical algorithms still in use today. gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), as usual, is an outstanding example. Among many other contributions, he made crucial advances in least-squares data fitting (1795), systems of linear equations (1809), and numer-ical quadrature (1814), as well as inventing the fast fourier transform did not become widely known until its rediscovery by[III.26](/part-03/the-fast-fourier-transform) (1805), though the last Cooley and Tukey in 1965.Around 1900, the numerical side of mathematics started to become less conspicuous in the activities of research mathematicians. This was a consequence of the growth of mathematics generally and of great advances in fields in which, for technical reasons, mathematical rigor had to be the heart of the matter. For example, many advances of the early twentieth century sprang from mathematicians’ new ability to reason rigorously about infinity, a subject relatively far from numerical calculation. was invented.

The revolution was sparked by hardware,(1943) and Numerische Mathebut it included mathematical and algorithmic develop-ments that had nothing to do with hardware. In the halfcentury from the 1950 s, machines sped up by a factorof around 109, but so did the best algorithms known for some problems, generating a combined increase in speed of almost in com pre he ns i ble scale.Half a century on, numerical analysis has grown into one of the largest branches of mathematics, the specialty of thousands of researchers who publish in dozens of mathematical journals as well as applica-tions journals across the sciences and engineering. Thanks to the efforts of these people going back many decades, and thanks to ever more powerful computers, we have reached a point where most of the classical mathematical problems of the physical sciences can be solved numerically to high accuracy. Most of the algorithms that make this possible were invented since 1950. the mathematical subject of Numerical analysis is built on a strong foundation: approximation theory. This field encompasses classical questions of inter-polation, series expansions, and harmonic analysis[VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830), Gauss, and others; semiclassical problems of[IV.11](/part-04/harmonic-analysis) associated with newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727), fourier polynomial and rational minimax approximation asso-ciated with names such as chebyshev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894) and Bernstein; and major newer topics, including splines, radial basis functions, andhave space to address these subjects, but in almost wavelets [VII.3](/part-07/wavelets-and-applications). We shall not every area of numerical analysis it is a fact that, sooneror later, the discussion comes down to approximation theory. 3 Machine Arithmetic and Rounding Errors It is well-known that computers cannot represent realor complex numbers exactly.

In floating-point arithmetic, the computed result of each elementary opera-tion is almost exactly correct in the following sense: if “*” is one of these four operations in its ideal form and “.* ” is the same operation as realized on the computer, then for any floating-point numbers that there is no underflow or overflow, x and y , assumingx .*$y = (x^{*} y)(1 + ε)$.

It is interest-[1$,2], \text{for example}$, ing to compare the fineness of this discretization withthat of the discretizations of physics. In a handful of solid or liquid or a balloonful of gas, the number ofatoms or molecules in a line from one point to another is on the order of 108 (the cube root of Avogadro’s number). Such a system behaves enough like a continuumto justify our definitions of physical quantities such as density, pressure, stress, strain, and temperature. Computer arithmetic, however, is more than a million times finer than this.

The modern way of describing such algorithms, how-ever, was apparently introduced as late as the 1930 s. Suppose that, say, tracted from the second row. This operation can beαtimes the first row of A is sub- interpreted as the multiplication of A on the left by the lower-triangular matrix with the additional nonzero entry M1 consisting of the identitym = −α.

To borrow a phrase from biology, we may say that this field has a central dogma: algorithms←→ matrix factorizations. In this framework we can quickly describe the next algorithm that needs to be considered. Not every matrixhas an LU factorization; a 2\times 2 \text{counterexample is the} matrix

$A = 01 10$.

Soon after computers came into use it was observed that even for matrices that do have LU factorizations, the pure form of Gaussian elimination is unstable, amplifying rounding errors by potentially large amounts. Stability can be achieved by interchanging rows during the elimination in order to bring maxi-mal entries to the diagonal, a process known as pivoting. Since pivoting acts on rows, it again corresponds to a multiplication of The matrix factorization corresponding to Gaussian A by other matrices on the left. elimination with pivoting is

with permuted rows. If the permutations are chosen tobring the largest entry below the diagonal in column$k$ to thethen L(k, k)has the additional property position before the kth elimination step,| | ⩽ 1 for all iij$and$ j.

The discovery of pivoting came quickly, but its theoretical analysis has proved astonishingly hard. Inpractice, pivoting makes Gaussian elimination almost perfectly stable, and it is routinely done by almost all computer programs that need to solve linear systemsof equations. Yet it was realized in around 1960 by Wilkinson and others that for certain exceptional matrices, Gaussian elimination is still unstable, even with pivoting. The lack of an explanation of this discrepancy represents an embarrassing gap at the heart of numerical analysis. Experiments suggest that the frac-tion of matrices (for example, among random matrices with independent normally distributed entries) forwhich Gaussian elimination amplifies rounding errors by a factor greater thanρn1^/2 is in a certain sense expo- nentially small as a function ofρ as ρ → $\i\text{nf ty}$, where n is the dimension, but a theorem to this effect has neverbeen proved. Meanwhile, beginning in the late 1950 s, the field of numerical linear algebra expanded in another direction: the use of algorithms based on orthogonal [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) or with unitary$Q^{-}1 = Q$[III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) matrices, that is, real matrices T or complex ones with Q^-1 = Q^*, where Q^* denotes the conjugate transpose. The starting point of such developments is the idea of A is an m \times  n matrix with m ⩾ n, a QR factorization QR factorization. If$of$ A is a product A = QR,

where angular. One can interpret this formula as a matrix ex-Q has orthonormal columns and R is upper-tri- pression of the familiar idea of on al ization, in which the columns Gram–Schmidt orthog-$q1$, q2, . . . of Q are determined one after another. These column opera-tions correspond to multiplication of A on the right by elementary upper-triangular matrices. One could saythat the Gram–Schmidt algorithm aims for Q and gets R as a by-product, and is thus a process of triangular orthogonalizati on showed in 1958 that a dual strategy of. A big event was when householder orthogonal triangularizati on is more effective for many purposes. In this approach, by applying a succession of elementary matrix operations each of which reflects Rm across a hyperplane, one reducesvia orthogonal operations: one aims at A to upper-triangular form R and gets Q

608

as a by-product. The Householder method turns out tobe more stable numerically, because orthogonal operations preserve norms and thus do not amplify the rounding errors introduced at each step.From the QR factorization sprang a rich collection of linear algebra algorithms in the 1960 s. The QR factorization can be used by itself to solve leastsquares problems and construct orthonormal bases.More remarkable is its use as a step in other algorithms. In particular, one of the central problems of numerical linear algebra is the determination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrixplete set of eigenvectors, then by forming a matrix A. If A has a com-X whose columns are these eigenvectors and a diagonal matrix eigenvalues, we obtain D whose diagonal entries are the corresponding AX = XD,

and hence, since$X \text{is nonsingular}$, A = XDX-1,

the which eigenvalue decomposition A is hermitian[III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), a complete set of. In the special case in orthonormal eigenvectors always exists, giving

Because polynomials of degree 5 or more cannot be solved by a formula, we know that eigen-values cannot generally be computed in closed form. The QR algorithm is therefore necessarily an iterative one, involving a sequence of QR factorizations that is in principle infinite. Nevertheless, its convergence is extraordinarily rapid. In the symmetric case, for a typical matrix A, the QR algorithm converges cubically, in the sense that at each step the number of cor-rect digits in one of the eigenvalue–eigenvector pairs approximately triples.The QR algorithm is one of the great triumphs of numerical analysis, and its impact through widely used software products has been enormous. Algorithms and analysis based on it led in the 1960 s to computer codesin Algol and Fortran and later to the software library EISPACK (“Eigensystem Package”) and its descendant LAPACK. The same methods have also been incorporated in general-purpose numerical libraries such as the NAG, IMSL, andand in problem-solving environments such as MAT-Numerical Recipes collections, LAB, Maple, and Mathematica. These developments

have been so successful that the computation of matrix eigenvalues long ago became a “black box” operation for virtually every scientist, with nobody but a few spe-cialists knowing the details of how it is done. A curious related story is that EISPACK’s relative LINPACK for solving linear systems of equations took on an unex-pected function: it became the original basis for the benchmarks that all computer manufacturers run totest the speed of their computers. If a supercomputer is lucky enough to make the TOP500 list, updated twicea year since 1993, it is because of its prowess in solving certain matrix problems Ax = b \text{of dimensions ranging} from 100 into the millions. ematicians, but the development of numerical linear algebra has also brought its younger cousin onto the The eigenvalue decomposition is familiar to all mathscene: the singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD was discovered by Beltrami, sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) in the late nineteenth century, andjordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922), \text{and made famous by Golub and other numerical analysts beginning in around} 1965.

It is also a step in an extraordinary variety of fur-ther computational problems including rank-deficient least-squares, computation of ranges and nullspaces, determination of ranks, “total least-squares,” low-rank approximation, and determination of angles between subspaces. All the discussion above concerns “classical” numerical linear algebra, born in the period 1950–75. The ensuing quarter-century brought in a whole new set of tools: methods for large-scale problems based on Krylov subspace iterations is as follows. Suppose a linear algebra problem is given.

Since the 1970 s, preconditioned matrix iterations have emerged as an indispensable tool of computa-tional science.

1990. Is there a “fast matrix inverse” in store for us? 5 Numerical Solution of Differential Equations Long before much attention was paid to linear alge-bra, mathematicians developed numerical methods to solve problems of analysis. The problem of numeri-cal integration or quadrature goes back to Gauss and newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727), and even to archimedes [VI.3](/part-06/archimedes-ca). The classic quadrature formulas are derived from the ideaof interpolating data at$n + 1 \text{points by a polynomial}$ of degree Equally spaced interpolation points give then, then integrating the polynomial exactly.Newton Cotes formulas diverge at a rate as high as 2, which are useful for small degrees butn as n → \infty: the Runge phenomenon. If the points are chosen optimally, then the result isand is numerically stable. It turns out that these opti-Gauss quadrature, which converges rapidly mal points are roots of Legendre polynomials, whichare clustered near the endpoints. (A proof is sketched in special functions poses is Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature[III.85](/part-03/special-functions).) Equally good for most pur-, where the interpolation points become cos$(jπ/n)$, 0 ⩽ j ⩽ n. This quadrature method is also stable and rapidly conver-gent, and unlike Gauss quadrature can be executed in O(n The explanation of why clustered points are necessary\log n) operations by the fast Fourier transform. for effective quadrature rules is related to the subjectof potential theory. get attention: the solution of ODEs. Thelas Around 1850 another problem of analysis began toare based on polynomial interpolation in equally Adams formuspaced points, which in practice typically number fewerthan ten. These were the first of what are now called multistep methods The idea here is that for an initial value problem for the numerical solution of ODEs.u^ =f (t, u)\text{time stepwith independent variable}Δt >0 and consider a finite set of time values$t > 0$, \text{we pick a smallt}n = nΔt, n ⩾ 0.

We then replace the ODE by an algebraic approxi-mation that enables us to calculate a succession of approximate values

$v^{n} \approx u(t^{n})$, n ⩾ 0.

(The superscript here is just a superscript, not a power.)The simplest such approximate formula, going back to euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), is

$(v^{n})^{+1} = v^{n} + \D\text{elta tf} (t^{n}$, vn)$, 610 or$, \text{using the abbreviation}$f^{n} = f (t^{n}$, vn), (vn)+1 = vn + \D\text{elta tfn}.

Both the ODE itself and its numerical approximation may involve one equation or many, in which case u(t, x) and vn become vectors of an appropriate dimension. The Adams formulas are higher-order gen-eral iz at i ons of Euler’s formula that are much more efficient at generating accurate solutions. For example, thefourth-order Adams–Bashforth formula is $(v^{n})^{+1} = v^{n} +^{2}4^{1} \Delta t(55f^{n} - 59(f^{n})^{-1} + 37(f^{n})^{-2} - 9(f^{n})^{-3})$. The term “fourth-order” reflects a new element inthe numerical treatment of problems of analysis: the appearance of questions of convergence as$\Delta t \to 0$. The formula above is of fourth order in the sense that itwill normally converge at the rate$O((\Delta t)^{4})$. The orders employed in practice are most often in the range 3–6, enabling excellent accuracy for all kinds of computa-tions, typically in the range of 3–10 digits, and higherorder formulas are occasionally used when still more accuracy is needed. sis literature is to speak not of the Most unfortunately, the habit in the numerical analy-convergence of these magnificently efficient methods, but of theirmore precisely their discretization or truncation error error, or as distinct from rounding error. This ubiquitous lan-guage of error analysis is dismal in tone, but seems ineradicable.At the turn of the twentieth century, the second great class of ODE algorithms, known asone-step methods, was developed by Runge, Heun, and Runge–Kutta or Kutta. For example, here are the formulas of the famous fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, which advance a numerical solution (again scalar or system) from timesteptn to (tn)+1 with the aid of four evaluations of the function$f$:

a = Δtf (tn, vn), b = \D\text{elta tf} (tn + 1 2\Delta t$, vn + 1 2 a)$, c = \D\text{elta tf} (tn + 1 2\Delta t$, vn + 1 2 b)$, d = \D\text{elta tf} (tn + \Delta t$, vn + c)$, (vn)+1 = vn + 1 6(a + 2 b + 2 c + d).

Runge–Kutta methods tend to be easier to implement but sometimes harder to analyze than multistep for-mulas. For example, for anys, it is a trivial matter to derive the coefficients of the formula, which has order of accuracy$s$-step Adams–Bashforth$p = s$. For Runge Kutta methods, by contrast, there is no simple relation-

ship between the number of “stages” (i.e., function eval-uations per step) and the attainable order of accuracy. The classical methods with Kutta in 1901 and have orders =p 1=,2 s, but it was not until,3,4 were known to 1963 that it was proved thatto achieve orderp = 5. The analysis of such problemss = 6 stages are required involves beautiful mathematics from graph theory andother areas, and a key figure in this area since the 1960 s has been John Butcher. For ordersmal numbers of stages ares = 7, 9, p11, \text{while for} = 6, 7, 8 \text{the mini} - p > 8 exact minima are not known. Fortunately, these higher orders are rarely needed for practical purposes. When computers began to be used to solve differential equations after World War II, a phenomenon ofthe greatest practical importance appeared: once again, numerical instability to the unbounded amplification of local errors by a. As before, this phrase refers computational process, but now the dominant local errors are usually those of discretization rather than rounding. Instability typically manifests itself as an oscillatory error in the computed solution that blows up exponentially as more numerical steps are taken.One mathematician concerned with this effect was Germund Dahlquist. Dahlquist saw that the phenomenon could be analyzed with great power and generality, and some people regard the appearance of his 1956 paper as one of the events marking the birth of modern numerical analysis. This landmark paper intro-duced what might be called the fundamental theorem of numerical analysis: consistency$+ stability = convergence$. The theory is based on precise definitions of these three notions along the following lines.property that the discrete formula has locally positive Consistency is the order of accuracy and thus models the right ODE.bility is the property that errors introduced at one time Stastep cannot grow unboundedly at later times.gence is the property that asΔt \to  0, in the absence Conver- of rounding errors, the numerical solution convergesto the correct result. Before Dahlquist’s paper, the idea of an equivalence of stability and convergence was per-haps in the air in the sense that practitioners realized that if a numerical scheme was not unstable, then itwould probably give a good approximation to the right answer. His theory gave rigorous form to that idea fora wide class of numerical methods. As computer methods for ODEs were being developed, the same was happening for the much bigger

subject of PDEs. Discrete numerical methods for solv-ing PDEs had been invented around 1910 by Richardson for applications in stress analysis and meteo-rology, and further developed by Southwell; in 1928 there was also a theoretical paper on finite-difference methods by courant [VI.83](/part-06/richard-courant-18881972), Friedrichs, and Lewy. But although the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy work later became famous, the impact of these ideas before com-puters came along was limited. After that point the subject developed quickly. Particularly influential inthe early years was the group of researchers around von Neumann at the Los Alamos laboratory, including the young Peter Lax. discovered that some numerical methods for PDEs were Just as for ODEs, von Neumann and his colleagues subject to catastrophic instabilities. For example, tosolve the linear wave equation$u = u \text{numerically we}$ may pick space and time stepsgrid,\Delta tx andx \Delta t \text{for a regularx}j = j\Delta x, tn = nΔt, j, n ⩾ 0,

and replace the PDE by algebraic formulas that com-pute a succession of approximate values:

The development of optimization has been somewhat indepen-dent of that of the rest of numerical analysis, carried forward in part by a community of scholars with close links to operations research and economics. achieve an extremum at a point of zero derivative, or at Calculus students learn that a smooth function may a boundary. The same two possibilities characterize thetwo big strands of the field of optimization. At one end there are problems of finding interior zeros and min-ima of unconstrained nonlinear functions by methods related to multivariate calculus. At the other are prob-lems of linear programming, where the function to be minimized is linear and therefore easy to understand, and all the challenge is in the boundary constraints. ject.

their Taylor series; indeed, Arnol’d has argued that Tay-lor series were Newton’s “main mathematical discovery.” To find a zerox, everyone knows the idea ofx* of a function Newton’s method F of a real variable: at the k Fth step, given an estimate^ (x(k))to define a linear approximation from which tox(k) \approx  x*, use the derivative derive a better estimate$x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)}$: $x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)} = x^{(}k) - F(x^{(}k))/F^ (x^{(}k))$. Newton (1669) and Raphson (1690) applied this ideato polynomials, and Simpson (1740) generalized it to other functions In today’s language, for a system of F and to systems of two equations.n equations in n unknowns, we regardat a pointx(k) \in  Rn is the F as annn\times -vector whose derivativen Jacobian matrix with entries $J^{i}j (x^{(}k)) = \partial x\partial F^{i} (x^{(}k))$, 1 ⩽ i, j ⩽ n.j

This matrix defines a linear approximation tois accurate for$x \approx x^{(}k)$. Newton’s method then takes F(x) that the matrix form $x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)} = x^{(}k) - (J(x^{(}k)))^{-1}F(x^{(}k))$, which in practice means that to get$x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)} from x^{(}k)$, we solve a linear system of equations: $J(x^{(}k))(x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)} - x^{(}k)) = −F(x^{(}k))$. As long aslar atx* and the initial guess is good enough, the J is Lipschitz continuous and nonsingu- convergence of this iteration is quadratic: $x^{(}(k^{+1})^{)} - x^{*} = O( x^{(}k) - (x^{*})^{2})$. (1) Students often think it might be a good idea to develop formulas to enhance the exponent in this estimate to 3 or 4. However, this is an illusion. Taking two steps ata time of a quadratically convergent algorithm yields a quartically convergent one, so the difference in effi-ciency between quadratic and quartic is at best a constant factor. The same goes if the exponent 2, 3, or4 is replaced by any other number greater than 1. The true distinction is between all of these algorithms that converge superlinearly, of which Newton’s method is the prototype, and those that converge geometrically, where the exponent is just 1.linearly or small step from solving a system of equations to min-imizing a scalar function From the point of view of multivariate calculus, it is af \text{of a variable} x \in Rn: to find a (local) minimum, we seek a zero of the gradient$g(x) = ∇f (x)$, an n-vector.

So what cantor subset of B, in fact showed was that the set of algebraic numbers had smaller cardinality than that of all real numbers. ferent kinds of infinite set: able In particular, Cantor distinguished between two dif-[III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets). A countable set is one that can be put into countable and uncountone-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.In other words, it is a set that we can “enumerate,” assigning a different natural number to each of its ele-ments. Let us see how this can be done for the algebraic numbers. Given a polynomial equation as above, let thenumber

For instance, there are only four equations of index$3 \text{with strictly positive}$ X +1 = 0, and X -1 = 0, which have as solutions 0, an, namely$, X2 = 0, 2X =-0,1,$ and 1. Thus, we can enumerate the algebraic numbersby first enumerating all solutions of equations of index

Note that from thisproof we also see that the sets Z and Q are countable. Cantor discovered that, surprisingly, the set R of real numbers is not countable. Here is Cantor’s orig-inal proof. Suppose, aiming for a contradiction, that r Choose the least0, r1, r2, . . . is an enumeration ofk such that a < r Rand put. Let a0 b == rr0..

Cantor also showed that there are bijections between any two of the sets R$n$, n ⩾ 1, \text{and even RN}, the set of all infinite sequences numbers, so all these sets have the same (uncountable)$r0$, r1, r2, . . . of real cardinality. works that constitute the origin of set theory. An impor-tant concept that he introduced was that of infinite, or From 1879 to 1884 Cantor published a series of “transfinite,”bers to count a collection of objects, we assign a num-ordinals. When we use the natural number to each object, starting with 1, continuing with2, 3, etc., and stopping when we have counted each object exactly once. When this process is over we havedone two things. The more obvious one is that we have obtained a number that tells us how many objects there are in the collec-n, the last number in the sequence, tion. But that is not all we have done: as we count wealso define an ordering on the objects that we were counting, namely the order in which we count them.This reflects two different ways in which we can think about the set$\\{1}$,2, . . . , n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. Sometimes all we care about is its size.

Thus, theω, we can continue the ordinal sequence in a sequence of ordinal numbers begins as follows: 0, 1$, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, . . . , ω, ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3, . . . .$ After this comes the next limit ordinal, which it seems natural to callω + ω, and which we can write as ω · 2. The sequence continues as ω · 2$, ω · 2 + 1, ω · 2 + 2, . . . , ω · n, . . . , ω · n + m, . . . .$ for generating new ordinals: adding 1 and passing tothe limit. What we mean by “passing to the limit” is As this discussion indicates, there are two basic rules “assigning a new ordinal number to the position in the ordinal sequence that comes straight after all the ordinals obtained so far.” For example, after all the ordinalsω · n + m comes the next limit ordinal, which we write$as$ω · ω$, or ω2$, \text{and we obtain}ω2$, ω2 + 1$, . . . , ω2 + ω, . . . , ω2 + ω · n, . . . , ω2 · n, . . . .

For ordinals this can be done in a par-ticularly simple way: we represent 0 by the empty set, In set theory, one likes to regard all mathematical and the ordinal numberof all its predecessors. For instance, the natural num-αis then identified with the set berhas cardinality nis identified with the setn) and the ordinal{0, 1ω, . . . , n+}$3 \text{is identified}$- 1 (which with the set$\\{0}$, 1, 2, 3, . . . , ω, ω + 1, ω + 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. If we think of ordinals in this way, then the ordering on the set ofordinals becomes set membership: ifα comes beforeβcessors ofin the ordinal sequence, thenβ and therefore an element ofα is one of the prede-β. A critically important property of this ordering is that each ordinalis a well-ordered set, which means that every nonempty subset of it has a least element.As we said earlier, cardinal numbers are used for measuring the sizes of sets, while ordinal numbers indi-cate the position in an ordered sequence. This distinction is much more apparent for infinite numbers than for finite ones, because then it is possible for two dif-ferent ordinals to have the same size. For example, the ordinals ing sets$\\{ω0}$, and1, 2, . . .ω +\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}1 are different but the correspond-and$\\{0}$,1,2, . . . , ω\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} \text{have the same} cardinality, as figure 1 shows. In fact, all sets that can becounted using the infinite ordinals we have described so far are countable. So in what sense are different ordinals different? The point is that although two sets suchas\\{0,1,2, . . . \\} and \\{0,1,2, . . . , ω\\} have the same cardi- nality, they are notfind a bijectionφ from one set to the other such thatorder isomorphic: that is, you cannot $φ(x) < φ(y)$“as sets” but not “as ordered sets.”wheneverx < y. Thus, they are the same Informally, the cardinal numbers are the possible sizes of sets. A convenient formal definition of a cardi-nal number is that it is an ordinal number that is bigger than all its predecessors. Two important examplesof such ordinals areω, the first infinite ordinal, and the set of all countable ordinals, which Cantor denotedbyω. The second of these is the first uncountable ordinal: uncountable since it cannot include itself asan element, and the first one because all its elements1 are countable. (If this seems paradoxical, consider the

Moreover, using limits as well, we can continue thisω1, ω2, ω3, . . . of larger and larger cardinal- sequence transfinitely: for example, the ordinal the limit of all the ordinalsω . As we do this, weωω is also produce the sequence of infinite, or transfinite,$n$ cardinals: א0$,א1, . . . ,א^{ω}$, אω+1, . . . ,אω ω, . . . ,אω1, $. . . ,א^{ω}2$, . . . , אω ω, . . . . sum and product. A convenient set-theoretic way todefine these binary operations is as follows. Given two Given two natural numbers, we can calculate their natural numbers A and B of size mmandandnn, respectively;, take any two disjoint sets$m + n \text{is then}$ the size of the unionsize of the set A \times  B, the set of all ordered pairs A∪ B. As for the product, it is the(a, b) witha \in  A and b \in  B. (For this set, which is called the Cartesian product, we do not need A and B to be disjoint.)The point of these definitions is that they apply just as well to infinite cardinal numbers: just replace and nin the above definitions by two infinite cardinalsmκnals is very simple, however. It turns out that for alland λ.

Can- continuum hypothesis, which will be discussed at length1 in section 5 below.It is not immediately obvious, but there are many mathematical contexts in which transfinite ordinals occur naturally. Cantor himself devised his theory of transfinite ordinals and cardinals as a result of his attempts, which were eventually successful, to prove the continuum hypothesis for closed sets. He first defined the derivative of a set X of real numbers to be the set you obtain when you throw out all the “iso-lated” points of X. These are points x for which you can find a small neighborhood aroundtains no other points in X. For example, ifx that con-X is the setexcept for 0, so the derivative of${0} ∪ \{1$,1 2,1 3$, . . . \}$, then all points in X is the set X are isolated{0}. repeatedly. If we set$X^{0}\text{In general}$, \text{given a set}⊇ X1 ⊇ X2 ⊇ · · ·X0, where=XX, we can take its derivative, then we obtain a sequence (Xn)+1 is the derivative oftake the intersection of all the$X^{n}$. But the sequence does not stop here: we can$X^{n} \text{and call it} X^{ω}$, and if we do that, then we can define(Xω)+1 \text{to be the deriva}- tive of$X^{ω}$, and so on. Thus, the reason that ordinals appear naturally is that we havethe derivative and taking the intersection of everything two operations, taking so far, which correspond to successors and limits inthe ordinal sequence. Cantor initially regarded superscripts such as$ω +$1 as “tags” that marked the transfinite stages of the derivation. These tags later becamethe countable ordinal numbers. Cantor proved that for every closed set X there must be a countable ordinal that$X^{α} = (X^{α})^{+1}$. It is easy to show that eachα(which could be finite) such$X^{β} \text{in the}$ sequence of derivatives is closed, and that it contains

From this it follows that X is either countable$\text{or of cardinality} 2$א . tween transfinite ordinals and cardinals and the struc-ture of the continuum was destined to leave its mark The intimate connection, discovered by Cantor, beon the entire subsequent development of set theory. 3 The Universe of All Sets In the discussion so far we have taken for granted thatevery set has a cardinality, or in other words that for every setbe put into one-to-one correspondence with X there is a unique cardinal number that can X. If κ is such a cardinal and$f$: X \to κ \text{is a bijection} (recall that we identify then we can define an ordering onκ with the set of all its predecessors)$, X \text{by taking} x < y if$ and only ifthis makesf (x) < f (y)X into a well-ordered set. But it is far from. Since κ is a well-ordered set, obvious that every set can be given a well-ordering: indeed, it is not obvious even for the set R. (If you need convincing of this, then try to find one.) ordinals and cardinals and to solve some of the fun-damental problems—such as computing where in the Thus, to make full use of the theory of transfinite aleph hierarchy of infinite cardinals the cardinal of R is—one must appeal to the assertion that every set can be well-ordered. With out well-ordering principle: the this assertion, one cannot even make sense of the ques-tions. The well-ordering principle was introduced by Cantor, but he was unable to prove it.listed proving that R could be well-ordered as part ofhilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) the first problem in his celebrated list of twenty-three unsolved mathematical problems presented in 1900 at the Second International Congress of mathematicians in Paris. Four years later, Ernst Zermelo gave a proof of the well-ordering principle that drew a lot of criti-cism for its use of the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) (AC), a principle that had been tacitly used for many yearsbut which was now brought into focus by Zermelo’s result.

need to continue with the development of set theory while avoiding the logical traps, or paradoxes, that originated in the careless use of the intuitive notion of a set (see[II.7](/part-02/foundations-crisis)). For instance, it seems intuitively clear that everythe crisis in the foundations of mathematics property determines a set, namely, the set of those objects that have that property. But then consider the property of determined a set, this would be the set of all ordinal being an ordinal number. If this property numbers. But a moment of reflection shows that there can not be such a set, since it would be well-ordered and would therefore correspond to an ordinal greater thanall ordinals, which is absurd. Similarly, the property of being a set that is not an element of itself cannot determine a set, for otherwise we fall into Russell’s paradox, that if A is such a set, then A is an element of A if and only ifnot every collection of objects, not even those that are A is not an element of A, which is absurd. Thus, defined by some property, can be taken to be a set. So what is a set? Zermelo’s 1908 axiomatization provides the first attempt to capture our intuitive notion of set in a short list of basic principles. It was later improved through contributions from skolem [VI.81](/part-06/thoralf-skolem-18871963), Abraham Fraenkel, and von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957), becoming what is now known asaxiom of choice, or ZFC.Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the is a “universe of all sets” that we would like to under-stand, and the axioms give us the tools we need to build The basic idea behind the axioms of ZFC is that there sets out of other sets. In usual mathematical practicewe take sets of integers, sets of real numbers, sets of functions, etc., but also sets of sets (such as sets ofopen sets in a topological space [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces)), sets of sets of sets (such as sets of open covers), and so on. Thus, the universe of all sets should consist not only of setsof objects, but also of sets of sets of objects, etc. Now it turns out that it is much more convenient to dis-pense with “objects” altogether and consider only sets whose elements are sets, whose elements are also sets, etc. Let us call those sets “pure sets.” The restriction to pure sets is technically advantageous and yields a more elegant theory. Moreover, it is possible to model traditional mathematical concepts such as real numbers using pure sets, so one does not lose any mathematical power. Pure sets are built from nothing, i.e., theempty set, by successively applying the “set of” operation. A simple example iswe start by forming${∅}$, then{∅$,{∅{∅,{∅}}}$,{∅}: to build this, and putting these two sets together gives us${∅}$,{∅, {∅}}}. Thus, at every stage we form all the sets whose elements are sets

already obtained in the previous stages. Once again, this can be continued transfinitely: at limit stages we collect into a set all the sets obtained so far, and keepgoing. The universe of all (pure) sets, represented by the letter axis representing the ordinals (see figure 2), therefore V and usually drawn as a V-shape with a vertical forms a cumulative well-ordered hierarchy, indexed bythe ordinal numbers, beginning with the empty set∅. That is, we let

Usually a further axiom appears on this list, called the pairing axiomthe set$\\{A}$, B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}. It asserts that for any two sets exists. In particular, {A} exists. Apply-A and B ing the union axiom to the setunion A ∪ B of A and B. But pairing can be derived\. \1, B\\} one then gets the from the other axioms. Another important axiom that appeared in Zermelo’s original list, one that is both natural and very useful, is the axiom of separation. It states that for every setset of elements of AAand everythat have the property definable property P is also P, the a set. But this axiom is a consequence of the axiom of replacement, so there is no need to include it in the list. Using the axiom of separation one can easily prove the existence of the empty set∅, as well as the intersec- tion A ∩ Band difference A - B of any two sets A and Bof foundation. The axiom of regularity is also known as theand it is usually stated as follows: every axiom nonempty set X has an \in -minimal element, i.e., an ele- ment that no element of X belongs to. In the presence of the other axioms the two formulations are equiva-lent. We chose the formulation in terms of the Vαs to stress the fact that this is a natural axiom based on the construction of the universe of all sets. But it isimportant to notice that the notions of “ordinal” and the “cumulative hierarchy ofthe formulation of the axioms of ZFC.$V^{α}$s” need not appear in the one hand, they tell us the things we can do with The axioms of ZFC lead a kind of double life. On sets. In this sense, ZFC is just like any other collec-tion of axioms for algebraic structures, e.g., the axioms for groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), \text{or fields} [I.3 §2.2](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions): \text{in both cases they give rules for creating new objects from old ones}, \text{though there are more rules for sets than there are for group or field elements and they are more complicated}.Thus, \text{just as one studies abstract groups}, i.e., \text{algebraic structures that satisfy the axioms for groups}, \text{so onecan study the mathematical structures that satisfy the axioms of ZFC}. \text{These are called models of ZFC}.

3.2 Formulas and Models

The ZFC axioms can be formalized using the languageof first-order logic for sets. The symbols of first-order logic are“∀” (for all) and “variables∃such as” (there exists); thex, y, z, . . .; the logical connec-quantifiers tives “¬” (not), “∧” (and), “∨” (or), “$\to$” (if ..., then ...), and “↔” (if and only if); the equality symbol “$=$”; and parentheses. To make this first-order logicadd one other symbol, “$\in$,” standing for “is an ele-for sets we ment of,” and the quantifiers are understood to rangeover sets. Here is how the axiom of extensionality is expressed in this language: $∀x∀y(∀z(z \in x ↔ z \in y) \to x = y)$. This reads as: for every setsetz belongs to x if and only if it belongs tox and every set y, if everyy (i.e., ifequal. It is an example of ax and y have the same elements), then formula in our language.x and y are Formulas can be defined inductively as follows. Theatomic formulas arex = y and x \in y. \text{Using quan}- tifiers and logical connectives one can build up more complicated formulas using the following rules: ifφ and(φ \to ψ ψ)\text{are formulas}, \text{then so are}, (φ ↔ ψ), ∀xφ, and¬∃φxφ, (φ. Thus, formulas∧ ψ), (φ ∨ ψ), \text{are the formal counterpart of sentences in English} (\text{orin any other natural language}) \text{that talk only about sets and the membership relation}. (\text{For another discussion of formal languages}, \text{see logic and model theory} [IV.23 §1](/part - 04/logic - and - model - theory).)Conversely, \text{any formula of the formal language can be interpreted as a sentence} (\text{in English}) \text{about sets}, \text{andit makes sense to ask whether the interpreted sentence is true or not}. Usually, by “true” \text{we mean} “\text{true in the universe about the truth or falsity of a formula in any structure Vof all sets},” \text{but it also makes sense to ask of the form For example}, \text{the formula} M, E , where E∀\text{xis a binary relation on}∃y x \in y \text{is true in all} M. models M, E \text{of ZFC}, \text{while the formula}∃x∀y y \in x \text{is false} (\text{because of the axiom of regularity}). Any formula that can be deduced from the axioms of ZFC is true in all models of ZFC.Once we have defined what a formula is, we are in a position to make many statements precise that would otherwise not be. For example, the axiom of replacement involves the notion of aproper sense of it one formulates it in terms of first-function-class. To make order formulas. For example, the operation that takeseach set\text{a to the singleton} {a}is definable, and this depends on the fact that the statementbe expressed by the formula$∀z(z \in y ↔yz = {= x)x}$. It iscan

not a function, since it is defined on all sets, and the universe of all sets is not a set. This is why we use the different phrase “function-class.” In addition, we sometimes allow classes. For example, the function-class that, for a fixed parameters in our definitions of function set formulab, takes each set∀z(z \in  y ↔a to the setz \in  x ∧ za\in ∩b)bis defined by the, which depends on the setb: we callb a parameter and we say that the function-class isgenerally, a function-class is a function on sets given definable with parameters. More by a formula. But the function itself may not exist asa set, since its domain may contain all sets, or all ordinals, etc. Since the axiom of replacement is a statement about all function-classes, it is not in fact a single axiombut rather an “axiom scheme,” consisting of one axiom for each function-class.An important consequence of the fact that ZFC can be formalized in first-order logic is that it is subject to a remarkable theorem of Löwenheim and Skolem. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is a general result about first-order formal languages; in the particular case of ZFC, it says that if ZFC has a model, then it has a countable model. More precisely, given any model$M = M$, E of ZFC, there is a model countable and that satisfies exactly the same sentences N of ZFC contained in M that is as ZFC have a countable model if one can prove in ZFC$M$. At first, this may seem paradoxical, for how can that there are uncountable sets? Does the theorem not lead to a contradiction and therefore imply that thereare no models of ZFC? Not quite. Suppose that we have a countable modelto show that the statement “N of ZFC and a setais countable” is true ina in N. If we want N, then we must show thatfromω to a. But it is possible for such a map to existin N there is a surjective map inout existing in V , or in some model N, because M Vthat is larger thanand M contain more sets, N, with- and therefore more functions, thancase, a is uncountable from the point of view of N does.

or even some set Skolem theorem also some countable set$M$, and therefore by the Löwenheim–M , which is a model of ZFC. As we shall see, while the existence of models of ZFC cannot be proved in ZFC, thefact that one can consistently assume that they exist— provided ZFC is consistent, of course—is of the greatest importance for set theory. Foundation of Mathematics4 Set Theory and the As we have seen, we can use ZFC to develop the theory of transfinite numbers. But it turns out that all stan-dard mathematical objects may be viewed as sets, and all classical mathematical theorems can be proved from ZFC using the usual logical rules of proof. For example, real numbers can be defined as certain sets of rational numbers, which can be defined aslence classes [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar) of ordered pairs of integers.equiva The ordered pair${m}$, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{m, n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}}, \text{integers can be defined as equivalence}(m, n)\text{can be defined as the set classes of ordered pairs of positive integers}, \text{and positive integers can be thought of as finite ordinals}, \text{whichas we have seen can be defined as sets}. \text{Tracing back}, \text{one finds that a real number can be regarded as a setof sets of sets of sets of sets of sets of finite ordinals}. Similarly, \text{all the usual mathematical objects}— \text{such as algebraic structures}, \text{vector spaces}, topologi-\text{cal spaces}, \text{smooth manifolds}, \text{dynamical systems}, \text{and so on}—\text{can be shown to exist in ZFC}. \text{Theorems con}-\text{cerning these objects can be expressed in the formal language of ZFC}, \text{as can their proofs}. \text{Of course}, \text{writing out a complete proof using the formal language would be extremely laborious}, \text{and the result would not only be very long but also virtually impossible to understand}. \text{It is important}, however, \text{to convince oneself that in principle it can be done}. \text{It is the fact that all standard mathematics can be formulated and devel}-\text{oped within the axiomatic system of ZFC that makes} \text{metamathematics} \text{ematical study of mathematics itself}. \text{For example}, itpossible, \text{that is}, \text{the rigorous math allows us to think about whether a mathematical statement has a proof}: \text{once we have rigorous definitions of} “\text{mathematical statement}” and “proof,” \text{the question of whether a proof exists becomes a mathematical onewith a determinate answer}. 4.1 \text{Undecidable Statements In mathematics the truth of a mathematical state} - mentφ \text{is established by means of a proof from basic IV}.22. \text{Set Theory principles or axioms}.

This statement asserts that the sequence of symbols0= 1 is not the last step of any formal proof from ZFC. One can encode a formal proof as a finite sequenceof natural numbers that satisfies certain arithmetical properties, and thereby regard the above statement as an arithmetical one. Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent axiomatic formal system that is rich enough to develop basic arithmetic, the arithmetical statement that asserts the consistency of the system cannot be proved. Thus, if ZFC is con-sistent, then its consistency can neither be proved nor disproved in ZFC. tem in which to develop mathematics. Thus, the truthof a mathematical statement is firmly established if its ZFC is currently accepted as the standard formal sys translation into the language of set theory is provablein ZFC. But what about undecidable statements? Since ZFC embodies all standard mathematical methods, thefact that a given mathematical statementφ is undecid- able in ZFC means that the truth or falsity ofbe established by means of usual mathematical prac-φ cannot tice. If all undecidable statements were like CONthis would probably not be a cause of worry, since they(ZFC), seem not to directly affect the kind of mathematical problems that people are usually interested in. But for better or worse this is not so. As we will see, thereare many statements of mathematical interest that are undecidable in ZFC.There is an obvious way of showing that a mathematical statement has a proof: you just find one. But howcan it be possible to prove, mathematically, that a given

mathematical statement question has a short but far-reaching answer. If we canφis undecidable in ZFC? This find a model can not be a proof of M of ZFC in whichφ (because that proof would showφ is false, then there that M andφ was true in N of ZFC with M). Therefore, if we can find modelsφ true in M and false in N, we can conclude that Unfortunately, a consequence of Gödel’s second in-φ is undecidable. completeness theorem is that it is not possible to provein ZFC the existence of a model of ZFC. This is because another theorem of Gödel, called the completeness theoremif and only if it has a model. However, we can get aroundfor first-order logic, asserts that ZFC is consistent this difficulty by splitting the proof of the undecidabil-ity ofφ into two relative consistency proofs: the first is a proof that if ZFC is consistent, then so is ZFC plusand the second is a proof that if ZFC is consistent, thenφ; so is ZFC plus the negation ofthat there is a model M of ZFC and proves the exis-φ. That is, one assumes tence of two models of ZFC: one whereone where it fails. One can then conclude that eitherφ holds, andφ and its negation are both unprovable in ZFC, or ZFC is in consistent, in which case everything is provable. One of the most surprising results of twentieth-century mathematics is that the continuum hypothesis is undecidable in ZFC. 5 The Continuum Hypothesis Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH)$, \text{first formulated in} 1878$, \text{states that every infinite set of real numbersis either countable or has the same cardinality as} R. \text{In ZFC}, \text{since AC implies that every set}, \text{and in par}-\text{ticular every infinite set of real numbers}, \text{can be put into one} - to-\text{one and onto} \text{correspondence} \text{with a cardi}-\text{nal number}, \text{one can easily see that CH is equivalent to the assertion that the cardinality oflently}, that 2א = א , \text{the version of the statement that} R is א1, \text{or equiva}- \text{we mentioned earlier}.\text{Solving CH was the first problem in Hilbert}’s famous0 1 \text{list of twenty}-\text{three unsolved problems}, \text{and has beenone of the main driving forces for the development of set theory}. \text{In spite of many attempts at proving CH by Cantor himself and by many leading} \text{mathematicians} \text{of the first third of the twentieth century}, \text{no major progress was made until}, \text{sixty years after its formulation}, Gö\text{del was able to prove its consistency with ZFC}. 5.1 \text{The Constructible Universe In} 1938, Gö\text{del found a way to construct}, \text{starting witha model} M \text{of ZFC}, \text{another model of ZFC}, contained 624 \text{in consistency of CH with ZFC}.

That CH holds in L is due to the fact that in L every real number appears at some countable stage of the construction, i.e., in some$L^{α}$, where α is countable in L. To prove this, one shows first that every realto some Lthat satisfies a finite number of axioms ofr belongs ZFC that are sufficient to buildβ L, where β is an ordinal that is not necessarily countable. Then, with the helpof the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, one can show that there is a countable subset satisfies the same axioms as X of L L. And then one showsβ that contains r and that X must be isomorphic toβLα for some countable ordinal$r$; this finishes the proof thatα, via an isomorphism that is the identity onr appears at a countable stage. But since there are onlyand L is countable for each countable ordinalא1 countable ordinals,α, there can be only$α א^{1} \text{real numbers}$. that are strictly necessary, namely those that were Since, for each ordinalα, Lα \text{contains only the sets}

These two principles, which will not be defined able mathematical structures by induction on the ordi-nals in such a way that the construction does not break down at limit stages.

Well, no. The problem is that there are some binary So, can we just pick any one of them and add it to contains them. For example, we can encode any count-able ordinalα as a real number as follows. First let f be a bijection from{(m, n) \in N2}:$f$ (m) < f (n)N to αand define a subset. Now choose a bijection A ⊂ N^2 to beg from N to N^2 and let c(n) = 1 if and only if g(n) \in  A.

If we try to circumvent the prob- lem by adding more sets tomodel of ZFC, then we may end up with M[c] so that it becomes a M[c] = L for some ordinal our purposes since CH holds in all models of ZFC of theγ greater than α. And this is not good forγ form Lγ. The conclusion is that we cannot just pick an arbitrary very carefully.c that is not in M: we will have to choose it that it should have no special property that singles itout.

of AC from ZF and of CH from ZFC, a result for whichhe got the Fields Medal in 1966, many set theorists Immediately after Cohen’s proof of the independence started developing the forcing technique in its full gen-erality (notably Azriel Lévy, Dana Scott, Joseph Shoenfield, and Robert Solovay) and began to apply it to otherwell-known mathematical problems. For instance, Solovay constructed a model of ZF in which every set of real numbers isshowing that AC is necessary for the existence of non-lebesgue measurable [III.55](/part-03/measures), thereby measurable sets. He also constructed a model of ZFCwhere every definable set of real numbers is Lebesgue measurable; therefore, nonmeasurable sets, although they can be proved to exist (see the example in sec-tion 6.1 below), cannot be explicitly given; Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum developed the theory of iter-ated forcing and used it to prove the consistency of Suslin’s hypothesis (see section 10 below); Adrian Mathias proved the consistency of the infinitary form oframsey’s theorem [IV.19 §2.2](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics); Saharon Shelah proved the undecidability of the Whitehead problem in group theory; and Richard Laver proved the consistency of the Borel conjecture; to cite just a few remarkable examples from the 1970 s. It continues to be a research area of great interest, very sophisticated from the technical point of view and The forcing technique now pervades all of set theory. of great beauty. It keeps producing important results, with applications in many areas of mathematics, suchas topology, combinatorics, and analysis. Especially influential has been the development over the last twenty-five years of the theory of proper forcing, introduced by Shelah. Proper forcing has proved very useful in the context of forcing iterations, and in the for-mulation and study of new forcing axioms, which will be dealt with in section 10, as well as in the analy-sis of cardinal invariants of the continuum. These are uncountable cardinals associated with various topolog-ical or combinatorial properties of the real line that can consistently take different values in different models obtained by forcing. An example of a cardinal invariant is the least number of null sets needed to coverthe real line. Another important development has been the use of class forcing by Anthony Dodd and Ronald Jensen for coding the universe into a single real num-ber, which shows that, amazingly, one can always use forcing to turn any model L(r ) for some real number Mr . A more recent contribu-into a model of the form tion is the invention by W. Hugh Woodin of new powerful forcing notions associated with the theory of large

Thus, it is desirable to find newaxioms that, once added to ZFC, will provide a solution to some of those questions. We shall discuss some candidates in the next few sections. 6 Large Cardinals As we have already seen, the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot form a set.

In 1917 Nikolai Luzin showed that all continuous images of Borel sets, the measurable. If a set is measurable, then so is its com-analytic sets, are also plement, so all complements of analytic sets, the coanalytic natural to ask whether we can continue like this. In par-sets, are also Lebesgue measurable. It is therefore ticular, are continuous images of coanalytic sets, orsets, as they are known, also measurable? The answerΣ1 2 to this question turns out to be undecidable in ZFC: in L there are Σ1 sets that are not Lebesgue measurable, and with forcing one can construct models where allsets are measurable.2$Σ^{1}^{2}$ Lebesgue-measurable set of reals hinges on the fact The proof given above of the existence of a nonthat Lebesgue measure is translation invariant. In fact, the proof shows that there cannot be any countably additive translation-invariant measure that extends Lebesgue measure and measures all sets of reals. Thus, a natural question, known as the measure problem, is whether, if one drops the requirement of transla-tion invariance, there can exist some countably additive measure that extends Lebesgue measure and measures all sets of reals. If such a measure exists, then the cardinality of the continuum cannot beא with n < ω, etc. In fact, Ulam proved in 1930 that aא1, nor א2, nor any positive solution to the measure problem implies thatthe cardinality ofn Ris extremely large: it is greater than or equal to the least uncountable regular cardinal that is a limit of smaller cardinals. He also proved that the existence of a nontrivial countably additive measure on anysure problem, or that there exists an uncountable car-set implies either a positive solution to the meadinalκ with a (nontrivial) \\{0,1\\}-valued κ-additive mea- sure that measures all its subsets. Such a cardinal is called compact, and therefore inaccessible. In fact, the set of measurable. Ifκ is measurable, then it is weakly

weakly compact cardinals smaller than1, and soκ is itself the κth weakly compact cardinal. Itκ has measure follows that the existence of a measurable cardinal cannot be proved in ZFC, even if one adds the axiom that inaccessible, or weakly compact, cardinals exist (unless, of course, ZFC plus the existence of such cardinals is in consistent). A complete clarification of the measure problem was finally provided by Solovay, who showed that if the solution is positive, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. Conversely, if there is a measurable cardinal, then one can build a forcing extension where the measure problem has a positive solution. measurable cardinal is that the universe$L$: that is, there are non constructible sets, and even An unexpected consequence of the existence of a V cannot be non constructible real numbers. In fact, if there is ameasurable cardinal, then V is much larger than L. For instance, the first uncountable cardinal, inaccessible cardinal in$L$. א1, is an avalanche of independence results, the hope arose that After the invention of forcing and the subsequent axioms asserting the existence of large cardinals, like measurable cardinals, would settle some of the questions that, thanks to the forcing technique, had been proved undecidable in ZFC. It was soon shown, however, by Lévy and Solovay, that large-cardinal axioms could not settle CH, as one could easily use forcing to change the cardinality of the continuum and make CHhold or fail without destroying the large cardinals. But Solovay proved in 1969 that, surprisingly, if there existsa measurable cardinal, then allΣ1 \text{sets of real num}- bers are Lebesgue measurable. So, while the axiom that2 asserts the existence of a measurable cardinal cannot settle the size of the continuum, it has a profound effect on its structure. It is indeed astonishing that measur-able cardinals, so far away from the sets of real numbers in the universe$V$, have such a strong influence on their basic properties. While the relationship between large cardinals and the structure of the continuum is not yet fully understood, great progress has been madein the last thirty years through the work done in descriptive set theory and determinacy, which will be described in sections 8 and 9 below.Some of the deepest and most technically difficult work in set theory is currently devoted to the construc-tion and analysis of canonical inner models for large cardinals. These are analogues of L for large cardinals, that is, they are models built in some canonical waythat contain all the ordinals and are transitive (i.e., they

629

contain all elements of their elements), and in which certain large cardinals exist. The larger the cardinal, the more difficult it is to build the model. This work is known as the One of the striking consequences of the inner model inner model program. program is that it provides a way of measuring the consistency strength of virtually any set-theoretic statementφ, using large cardinals. That is, there are large- cardinal axioms ZFC plusφ implies that of ZFC plus A1 and A2 such that the consistency of A1 and is implied by the consistency of ZFC plus A2. We refer to A1 as aas anlower bound upper boundfor the consistency of. In the fortunate cases when theφ \text{and to} A2\text{lower and upper bounds coincide}, \text{we obtain an exact measure of the consistency strength of}φ. \text{An upper boundof ZFC plus} A2 \text{is usually obtained by forcing over a model} A2, \text{whereas a lower bound} A1 \text{is obtained by inner model theory}. \text{Earlier in this section we sawthat the consistency strength of a positive solution to the measure problem is exactly that of the existence ofa measurable cardinal}. \text{We shall see another important example in the next section}. \text{strength of set}-\text{theoretic statements}—or, \text{even better}, \text{Knowing upper and lower bounds for the consistency knowing their exact consistency strength}—\text{is extremely useful for comparing them}.

The GCH, which, as we saw, holds in the con-structible universe L, states precisely that 2κ has the least possible value, namely, the least cardinal greaterthanκ, \text{usually denoted by} κ+.

But curiously, the value of the exponential func- tion at a singular cardinal ofsomehow determined by its values at smaller regular uncountable cofinality is cardinals. Indeed, in 1975, Jack Silver proved that ifκis a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality and 2α = α^+ for all α < κ, then 2^κ = κ^+. That is, if the GCH holds belowis also the case for singular cardinals ofκ, then it also holds atcountableκ. That this cofinality is a consequence of theesis (SCH), a general principle weaker than the Gch singular cardinal hypoth that completely determines singular cardinal exponentiation, relative to exponentiation for regular cardinals.A special case of SCH is the following. If 2א < א \text{for all} finite holds below$n$, thenא(2א)ω, then it must hold at= אω +1. So, in particular, if the GCHאn. \text{Shelah used}ω his powerful “PCF theory” to obtain the unexpected result that if 2ωאn < א \text{for all} n, then (2ω()א){ω} < א . So, if GCH holds belowon the possible values of 2$א^{ω}^{ω}$, then there is a bound (in ZFC!)א . But can this value actuallyω4 be greater than the least possible one, namely particular, can the GCH first fail atω א? The answer is$א^{ω}^{+}1$? In yes, but large cardinals are needed. Indeed, on the onehand Menachem Magidor proved the consistency of theω first failure of GCH atof the existence of a supercompact cardinal. Thus, the$א^{ω}$, assuming the consistency existence of a supercompact cardinal is an upper bound for the failure of SCH. On the other hand, using inner model theory, Dodd and Jensen showed that large car-

An exact measure of the consistency strength of the failure of SCHwas later established by Moti Gitik. 8 Determinacy It turns out that the existence of very large cardi-nals, such as supercompact cardinals, has a dramatic effect on the properties of sets of real numbers, espe-cially when they can be defined in some simple way. The link between the two appears through the analy-sis of certain infinite two-player games that are associated with sets of real numbers. Given a subsetof[0,1], consider the following infinite game associ-$A$ ated with$A$: there are two players, I and II, who alternately choose a number begin with, player I plays ninth at equals either 0 or 1. To0, then player II plays n1, to which I answers by playing the game is displayed in figure 3. At the end of the run,$n2$, and so on. A run of the players have produced an infinite binary sequence: n , n , n , . . . . This sequence can be regarded as the binary expansion of a real number0 1 2$r in [0$, 1]. Player I wins the game ifotherwise.r belongs to A and player II wins ning strategy for player I is simply to start by play-ing 0, whereas if For example, if\text{AA is the interval}= [0,1 ), then player II wins the[0,1 2], then a win- game by playing 1 in her first move. But for mostgames, the question of who wins is not decided after4 any finite number of moves. For instance, ifset of rational points of[0, 1], then one can easily see A is the that player II has a strategy for winning the game (for example, whatever player I does, player II will win if she plays 01001000100001. . . ), but she will not win at any finite stage of the run.The game is determined if one of the two players has a winning strategy. Formally, aplayer II is a functionf that assigns 0 or 1 to each strategy for finite binary sequence of odd length. It is a winning strategy f (n0, n1 if player II always wins the game if she plays, . . . , n ) in her kth turn, whatever moves are made by player I. Similarly, one can define a winning2 kstrategy for I. We say that the setthe game associated with A is determined. One might A is determined if

For example, the(AD), which asserts that all sets of reals are determined, axiom of determinacy implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire (i.e., differs from an open set by a set of first category), and has the perfect set prop-erty (i.e., contains a perfect set if it is uncountable). To give the flavor of a typical argument, let us indicate why every set First, one observes that it is enough to show that if A of reals is Lebesgue measurable. all measurable subsets ofbe null.

And since this works for all ε > 0, A must A is be null. sets of reals, it implies the negation of AC, so AD is in consistent with ZFC. However, weaker versions of ADWhile AD rules out the existence of badly behaved are compatible with, and even follow from, ZFC. Indeed, Donald Martin proved in 1975 that ZFC implies that every Borel set is determined. Moreover, if there exists ameasurable cardinal, then every analytic set, and therefore also every coanalytic set, is determined. A natural question, therefore, is whether the existence of larger cardinals implies the determinacy of more complex sets such as the$Σ^{1} sets$. the determinacy of simple sets of reals was first made explicit by Leo Harrington, who showed that the deter-The intimate connection between large cardinals and2 minacy of all analytic sets is in fact equivalent to a large-cardinal principle slightly weaker than the exis-tence of a measurable cardinal. As we shall shortly see, large cardinals imply the determinacy of certain sim-ply definable sets of reals, the so-called projective sets, while the determinacy of those sets implies in turn the existence of the same kind of large cardinals in someinner models.

Descriptive Set Theory9 Projective Sets and

As we have seen, very basic questions about sets ofreal numbers can be extremely hard to answer. However, it often turns out to be possible to answer them for sets that occur “in nature,” or that can be explicitly described. This raises the hope that one might be able to prove facts about definable sets of reals that cannotbe proved for arbitrary sets. The study of the structure of definable sets of reals is the subject ofsets are the Borel sets, and also the descriptive set theory. Examples of such projective sets, which are sets that can be obtained from Borel sets by taking continuous images and complements. An equiv-alent definition of the projective sets is that they are subsets ofof Rn by a mixture of projecting to a lower dimension R that can be obtained from closed subsets and taking complements. To see how this relates to definability, consider projecting a subset$A ⊂ R^{2} down$ to thethat there existsx-axis. The result will be the set of ally with (x, y) \in  A. Thus, projectionx such corresponds to existential quantification. Taking com-plements corresponds to negation, so one can combine the two and obtain universal quantification as well. Onecan therefore think of a projective set as a set that is definable from a closed set. sets, they are projective. And so are the complements Since analytic sets are continuous images of Borel of the analytic sets, the coanalytic sets, and the con-tinuous images of coanalytic sets, the$Σ^{1} sets$. More complex projective sets are obtained by taking com-plements ofΣ1 sets, the so-called Π1 sets, their contin-2 uous images, called hierarchy of increasing complexity, in accordance with2$Σ^{3}^{1}$, etc. The projective sets form a2 the number of steps (always finite) that are necessaryto obtain them from the Borel sets. Many sets of reals that appear naturally in usual mathematical practice are projective. Moreover, the results and techniques of descriptive set theory, although originally developed for the study of sets of reals, also apply to definable sets in any Polish space (a separable and completemetriza ble space). These include basic examples suchas Rn, C, separable [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces), etc., where projective sets arise in a very natural way. For example, banach spaces in the spaceon[0, 1] with the sup norm, the set of every where dif-C[0,1] of continuous real-valued functions ferentiable functions is coanalytic, and the set of func-tions that satisfy the mean value theorem isΠ1.

In 1920 Suslin conjectured that if instead of separability one assumes the weaker condition, or CCC, which demands that every pairwise-countable chain disjoint collection of open intervals should be at most countable, then it must still be isomorphic to R. The importance of SH for the development of set theory is that it led to the discovery of a new class of axioms, theso-called forcing axioms. In 1967, Solovay and Tennenbaum used forcing to construct a model in which SH holds. The idea is to usethe forcing to destroy any counterexamples that there might be to SH. But when one does this one may create new ones, and the result is that one needs to force again and again, transfinitely many times. The iteration of forcing is technically cumbersome and difficult tocontrol, for many unwanted things can happen at the limit stages. For instance, it may become countable.ω1 may be “collapsed,” i.e., general, a forcing argument involves a partially ordered Fortunately, these difficulties can be dealt with. In

set. (In the case we looked at earlier, it was the setof all finite binary sequences, with$p < q if p was$ a proper initial segment ofq.) If one starts with a model where GCH holds, uses only partial orderings that are CCC—that is, in which every set of in compatible elements is countable—and takes so-called limits at the limit stages, then inω steps one candirect destroy all counterexamples so that SH holds in thefinal model. On the other hand, Jensen proved in 19682 that a counterexample to SH exists inthe undecidability of SH in ZFC.L, thereby proving Martin isolated a new principle now known asaxiom From the construction of Solovay and Tennenbaum,(MA), which generalizes the well-known Martin’s Baire category theorempact Hausdorff topological space, the intersection of a.

However, MA does not decide the cardinality of R. questions that are undecidable in ZFC. For example, it implies SH and that every MA has been used with great success to solve manyΣ1 \text{set is Lebesgue mea}- surable. But is MA really an axiom? In what sense, ifany, is it a natural, or at least plausible, assumption2 about sets? Is the fact that it decides many ZFC undecid-able questions sufficient for it to be accepted as being on a par with the ZFC axioms or the axioms of large cardinals? We shall come back to this.MA has many different equivalent formulations. The original formulation of Martin was more closely con-nected with forcing—hence the term forcing axiom. Roughly speaking it said that if you have a CCC par-tial order, then you can avoidא avoidable properties, and not just countably many. This allows one to provethe existence of generic subsets of the partial order,1 over models Stronger forcing axioms can be obtained by expand-$M \text{of size} א^{1}$. ing the class of partial orderings to which MA applies while keeping the axiom consistent. An important such strengthening is the proper forcing axiom (PFA), which

The strongest possible forcing axiom of this type was dis-covered by Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah in 1988. It is called with ZFC, assuming the consistency of a supercompact Martin’s maximum (MM) and is consistent cardinal. example, PFA, and therefore also MM, implies the axiomof projective determinacy (PD), the singular cardinal Both MM and PFA have striking consequences. For hypothesis (SCH), and that the cardinality of R isא2. them without having to go into the details of forcing, just as An advantage of forcing axioms is that one can apply♦ and save one from having to go into the details of constructible sets. A very good example ofthis is PFA and some combinatorial principles derived from it, like the so-called have been used with great success by Stevo Todor-open coloring axiom, which cevic to solve many outstanding problems in general topology and infinite combinatorics. As we have already pointed out, forcing axioms are not as intuitively evident as the ZFC axioms, or eventhe axioms of large cardinals, so one can ask to what extent they should be considered as true axioms ofset theory rather than just useful principles for showing that certain statements are consistent with ZFC. In the case of MA and some weaker forms of PFAand MM, some justification for their being taken as true axioms is based on the fact that they are equiv-alent to principles of generic absoluteness. That is, they assert, under certain restrictions that are necessary to avoid in consistency, thatdoes exist. More precisely, if some set having certain everything that might exist, properties could be forced to exist over having the same properties already exists (in V , then a set V ). So, like the axioms of large cardinals, they are maximality principles, i.e., they attempt to make possible.V as large as a seton subsets of For example, MA is equivalent to the assertion that if X having some properties that depend exclusivelyω could be forced to exist over V using a CCC partial ordering V . This character ization of MA in terms of generic abso-1 P, then such an X already exists in luteness provides some justification for regarding MAas a true axiom of set theory. The analogous principle of generic absoluteness, but for proper partial order-ings instead of CCC, is known as the bounded proper forcing axiom (BPFA). Although weaker than PFA, BPFA

11 Final Remarks

In this short account of set theory, we have reviewed some of the key developments since its beginnings inthe late nineteenth century. What started in the hands of Cantor as a mathematical theory of transfinite num-bers has developed to become a general theory of infinite sets and a foundation for mathematics. The fact that it has been possible to unify all of classical math-ematics into one single theoretical framework, the ZFC axiom system, is certainly remarkable. But beyond this, and most importantly, the techniques developed by set theory, such as construct i bility, forcing, infinite combinatorics, the theory of large cardinals, determinacy, the descriptive theory of definable sets in Polish spaces, etc., have turned it into a discipline of great depth andbeauty, with fascinating results that stimulate and challenge our imagination, and with numerous applications in areas such as algebra, topology, real and complex analysis, functional analysis, and measure theory. In the twenty-first century, the ideas and techniques gen-erated within set theory will surely continue to contribute to the solution of outstanding mathematical problems, old as well as new, and will help mathematicians gain an ever deeper insight into the complexities and vastness of the mathematical universe.

1 Languages and Theories

Mathematical logic is the study of formal languages that are used to describe mathematical structures and what these can tell us about the structures themselves. We can learn a lot about a formal language by inves-tigating which of its sentences are true for the structure it describes, and we can learn a lot about the structure by investigating the subsets of it that can bedefined using the language. In this article, we shall see several examples of languages and the structures thatthey are used to describe. We shall also see instances of the remarkable phenomenon that theorems in logic can sometimes be used to prove “purely mathemati-cal” results that seem to have nothing to do with logic. This introductory section briefly introduces some of the basic ideas that will be needed to understand thelater sections. All the formal languages that we consider will be extensions of a basic logical language that we shall denoteby L . The statements, or formulas, of this language are made up of the following components:0 variables, which are denoted by letters of the alphabet such asx or y, or letters with subscripts such as v , v , . . .; thethe parentheses logical connectives“(” and “∧, )∨”; the,¬, \to equality symbol, ↔, which we rea(d1)2“$=$”; as “and,” “or,” “not,” “implies,” and “if and only if”; andthe quantifiers∃ and ∀, which we read as “there exists” and “for all.” (If these symbols are unfamiliar to you, then you should read the language and grammar of mathematics article.) Here are a couple of formulas of[I.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar) before attempting to read this$L$: (ii)(i)∀∀xx ∀(xy=∃yz ∨(zx==xz∧)$. z = y$); The first of these says that if any object exists at all thenthere are at least three objects, and the second says that y and z are the only objects. There is an important dif- ference between the two formulas: the variables andzthat occur in the first formula are all boundxvari-, y, ables, which means that they are all attached to quantifiers, whereas in the second formula, only the vari-ablex is bound, while the variables y and z are free. This means that the first formula expresses a statement about some mathematical structure, while the second

is a statement about not just a structure but also the particular elementsy and z. formulas out of smaller ones. We will not give themall, but for example if There are various rules that allow one to build largerφ and ψ are formulas, then ¬φ,φ ∨ ψ, φ ∧ ψ, φ \to  ψ, and φ ↔ ψ are all formulas. In general, ifusing logical connectives (and parentheses), then weφ is built out of smaller formulas φ1, . . . , φn call important way to modify a formula is quantification:φ \text{a Boolean combination of} φ1, . . . , φn. Another$if$∀xφ(x)φ(x) is a formula involving a free variable and ∃xφ(x) are both formulas. x, then which makes them not very useful for describing inter-esting mathematical structures. Suppose, for example, The formulas just discussed are “purely logical,” that we wanted to study real solutions to algebraic and exponential equations over the field [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of real numbers. We can think of this as studying the“mathematical structure” R$\exp = (R$,+, ·, \exp , <,0,1), where the right-hand side is a septuple that consists ofthe set R of real numbers, the binary operations of addition and multiplication, the[III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions), the “less than” relation, and the real numbers 0 exponential function and 1.The various components of this structure are of course related to each other in many ways, but we can-not express these relationships unless we are prepared to extend the basic language wanted to write, in a formal way, the statement that L0. For example, if we the exponential function turns addition into multipli-cation, then the obvious thing to write down would be (i)$∀x∀y \exp (x) · \exp (y) = \exp (x + y)$. Here we have two quantifiers, two bound variables andy, and the equals sign, but the rest of the for-x mula involves extraneous elements such as “$+$”, “·”, and “exp”. Thus, to discuss the structure the language L to a language L , by adding in the R\exp , we extend symbols “these come with various syntactic rules that reflect the$+$”, “$·^{0}$”, “exp”, “$<$”, “0”, and “1”. \text{Of course},$\exp$ fact that “$+$” is a binary operation, “exp” is a function, and so on. For instance, these rules would allow us towrite exp(x + y) = z but would forbid us to write\exp Here are three more(x = y) + z. L-formulas:

$\exp$

(iii)(iv)(ii)$∀∃∃x \text{xy yx} (x >^{2}^{2}= −= 0x$1;.$→ ∃y \exp (y) = x)$;

We interpret these formulas as the assertions “for all posit i vex, there is a y such that ey = x,” “$-1 \text{is a}$ square,” and “above are declarative statements about the structurexis a square.” The first three formulas R\exp . Formulas (i) and (ii) are true in R\exp , while (iii) is false. Formula (iv) is different because able: thus, it expresses a property ofxx. (For instance, is a free vari- it is true ifx = 8, but false if x = −7.) A sentence is defined to be a formula with no free variables. Ifan L -sentence, then φ is either true or false in Rφ is.aφ(a1 If, . . . , a1φ\exp , . . . , ais a formula with free variablesn are real numbers, then we writen) if the formula φ is true for the partic-x1, . . . , x Rn \exp , and \exp 2 ular sequence$(a1$, . . . , an). We think of the formula as defining the set ${(a^{1}}$, . . . , an) \in Rn: R$\exp 2 φ(a1, . . . , an)$, that is, the set of all sequences$(a^{1}$, . . . , an) for which the formula is true when you seti. For example, the formula xi to equal ai for every∃z (x = z2 + 1 ∧ y = z · \exp (\exp (z))) defines the parametrized curve$/+$, 0 t2 + 1, t(ee)t:$t \in R$.

tant point, let us consider the structure For another example, one that illustrates an impor-(Z, +,·,0,1): that is, the integers, with addition, multiplication, 0, and 1. The language used to describe this structure is thetion here lists the symbols that we add to the basic language of rings,$Lrng = L(+$,·,0,1). (The nota- language usual ordering on$L^{0}$.) The language Z, but, surprisingly, this ordering can Lrng has no symbol for the nevertheless be defined in terms ofthe nonobviousness of this fact, the reader is encour-$L^{r}ng$. (\text{To appreciate} aged to try to work out why it is true before readingon.) lagrange tive integer is a sum of four squares. It follows that the The trick is to use a well-known theorem due to[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), which asserts that every nonnega statementx ⩾0 can be defined by the formula∃y1∃y2∃y3∃y4 x = (y1)2 + (y2)2 + (y3)2 + (y4)2. (Of course, we are also using the fact that a negative integer cannot be written as a sum of four squares. Note too that a similar trick would work even if all one knew was that every nonnegative integer was a sum ofa hundred squares.) Once one has a way of expressing the statement thatxis nonnegative, it is easy to define the symbol “$<$”. The interesting aspect of this is that

the reformulation was not obvious—it depended on agenuine mathematical theorem. restricted in several ways, of which two stand out in particular.It is important to understand that formulas are •Formulas are finite. We do not allow formulas like ∀x > 0 (x < 1 ∨ x < 1 + 1 ∨ x < 1 + 1 + 1 ∨ · · · ), which would express the fact that R has the socalled Archimedean property. (If we did, then itwould be much easier to define “$<$” above.) •Quantifiers range over elements of the structure, and not subsets. This rules out a “second-order”formula such as ∀S ⊆ R (if Sthenis bounded above S has a least upper bound, ), which would express the completeness of R by quantifying over all subsets S of R. Since we look just at “first-order” formulas, what we are studying is often called first-order logic. let us discuss them more generally. Acally something like Now that we have seen some examples of languages, L or Labove: that is, a set language is basiof symbols (combined with the basic logical symbols)together with some rules concerning their use. If$\exp ^{r}ng L \text{is a}$ language, then anture in which all the sentences of L-structure is a mathematical struc-L can be interpreted. (This concept will become clearer in a moment, whenwe give a couple of examples.) An L-theory T is just a set ofthat an LL-sentences, which one can think of as axioms-structure might or might not satisfy. A model$of$ T is then an L-structure M in which all the sentences ofstructure was a model for the formulas (i) and (ii) of T, suitably interpreted, are true. For instance, the the language model for the same two formulas would be one in which L\exp  that we discussed earlier. (Another we replaced the exponential function by the function2$x$ and interpreted “exp” as referring to that function instead.)The justification for the word “theory” is clearer in another example, the language of$L = L(◦$, e). Here, ◦ is a binary operation symbol groups[I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), andgrpe is a constant. We might look at the theory T grp consisting of the sentences (iii)(ii)(i)∀∀∀xx xx∀∃y xy◦∀ez x◦=ye◦◦=(yxy=◦◦ z)xx;==e(x;◦ y) ◦ z; which are the usual axioms for groups.

We then interpret “◦” as referring tof, “ e” as referring to the element$a$, and quantification as being over the setof (iii) is that for every M.

Thus, the whether there is a structure or a theory on the left-hand side. However, these two meanings are closely relatedin that they are both concerned with truth in models: M 2 φ means that φ is true in the model M, and T 2 φ, sible model ofa “semantic” notion of entailment.as we have just said, means that T. Either way, the symbol “φ is true in every pos-2” stands for in Returning to the example of groups, if Lgrp, then Tgrp 2 φ if and only if φ is true for everyφ is a sentence group.

One might hope to find a much smaller theory that yielded thesame true sentences. That is, we could try to find a simple set of axioms about N that we know are true and hope that every true sentence follows from these axioms. A good candidate ismetic, or PA. This is a theory in the language first-order Peano arith-$L(+$, ·, 0, 1) that involves a few simple axioms about addition and multiplication, such as

$∀x∀y x · (y + 1) = x · y + x$,

together with axioms for induction.

The reason is that the obvious statement that expresses the principle of mathematical induction, namely Why do we need more than one axiom of induction? ∀A (0 \in  A ∧ ∀x x \in  A \to  x + 1 \in  A) → ∀x x \in  A, is not a first-order sentence, because the quantifier isapplied to all subsets A of N. (It is also not a sentence in Lrngsince it uses the symbol “$\in$”, but this is a less fundamental problem.) To get around this difficulty, onehas a separate axiom of induction for each formulaφ. It is the assertion that $[φ(0) ∧ ∀x (φ(x) \to φ(x + 1))] → ∀x φ(x)$. In words, this says that ifφ(0) \text{is true and} φ(x + 1) is true wheneverx in N. φ(x) is true, then φ(x) is true for every one might hope that PAin Most of number theory can be formalized in PA and N.

But this means that we can decide which by simply going through all possible proofs in PA until wefind a proof ofψ or a proof of ¬ψ. sentence was a self-referential sentence that effectively asserted Gödel’s original example of a true but unprovable “I am not provable from PA.” More precisely, he found a sentence was able to show thatψ is true in N if and only ifψ for which heψ is not provable from PA. With more work he showed thatthere is a sentence that asserts “PA is consistent” that is unprovable from PA. The somewhat artificial and meta mathematical nature of these sentences mightlead one to hope that all “mathematically interesting” sentences about N are settled by PA. However, more recent work has shown that even this is a forlorn hope, since there are undecidable statements related to ramsey’s theorem Undecidability also appears in number theory in[IV.19 §2.2](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics) in finite combinatorics. a very basic way.

An important open question is whether there is an algorithm to decide if a polynomial with rational coefficients has a rational zero. Hilbert’s tenth problem is also discussed inof the halting problem [V.20](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-halting-problem), and other interesting the insolubility examples of undecidability can be found inand combinatorial group theory [IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory).geometric 3 Compactness A theory that satisfy all of the sentences in T is called satisfiable if there are structures T (that is, if T has a model), and we call contradiction from TT.

Recall that a field is algebraically closed if every polynomial with coefficients in the field has a root in thefield.

Hence, by the compact-$K 2 T$, then F , . . . , F are polynomials over an algebraically closed field withno common zero, but it is impossible to find polyno-1$m$ mials$G^{1}$, . . . , Gm such that Gi Fi = 1. This contradicts Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. Notice that in the above argument we did not say anything about the dependence of$d$. This is because the proof does not actually find al on n, m, and bound: it merely shows that some sort of bound must exist. However, good explicit bounds were recently discovered—see algebraic geometry [IV.4](/part-04/algebra) for more details. 4 The Complex Field A surprising counterpoint to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem is a result of tarski [VI.87](/part-06/alfred-tarski-19011983), which states that the theories of the fields of real and complex numbers areknown asdecidable. The key to these results is a method quantifier elimination. If we have a formula without quantifiers that concerns the natural numbers, then it is easy to decide whether it is true or false. The negative solution to Hilbert’s tenth problem shows that as soon as we start adding existential quantifiers (as wedo if, for example, we assert that a polynomial has a zero), then we leave the realm of decidability. it will be very useful if we can find an equivalent for-Thus, if we want to show that a formula is decidable, mula that does not have quantifiers. And in some set-tings, this turns out to be possible. For example, let

φ(a, b, c) be the formula∃x ax2 + bx + c = 0.

The usual rule for solving quadratics tells us that, aslong asa = 0, this is true in R if and only if b2 ⩾ 4 ac. Therefore, R2 φ(a, b, c) if and only if[(a = 0 ∧ b2 - 4 ac ⩾ 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ (b = 0 ∨ c = 0))]. As for the complex numbers, it is easy to see that C2φ(a, b, c) \text{if and only ifa} = 0 ∨ b = 0 ∨ c = 0.

The first is that sentences in the language not distinguish between different algebraically closed Lr\text{ng can}- fields of the same characteristic. That is, if L -sentence that is true for some algebraically closedφ is any field of characteristic then it is true in every algebraically closed field ofrngp (where p is allowed to be zero), characteristic To see why this is true, letp.

If a polynomial map from C$n to C^{n} \text{is an}$ injection, then it must also be a surjection. very simple indeed: what is remarkable is that it is of The basic thought behind the proof of this result is any help. It is the observation that ifthen every injective polynomial map fromkis a finite field,$k^{n} to k^{n} \text{is a}$ surjection.

Well, the prements are true for one field if and only if they are truefor another. We shall use these results to transfer our problem from C, where it is hard, to a finite fieldk, where it is trivial.

So we could eliminate this quantifier if we were prepared to add asymbol for the ordering to our language. An amazing result of Tarski shows that this is the only obstruction to quantifier elimination. Let Lor be the language of ordered rings, which is the language of rings with the addition of the symbol “for an ordering. Which L -sentences are true in the real<” field? Some of the properties ofin Linclude: or R that we can formalize or (i) the axioms for ordered fields, such as the sentence∀x∀y (x > 0 ∧ y > 0) \to x · y >0; (ii) the intermediate-value property for polynomials, which states that ifp(x) is a polynomial and there existp(b), then there exists a real numbera and b such that a < b and p(a) <c such that0 <a < c < b and p(c) = 0.

The intermediate-value property is expressed not byjust one sentence, but by the infinite sequence of sentences

Indeed, the closure ofthe set$A$is, by definition, $x \in R^{n}$:$∀ > 0 ∃y \in A^{i}=^{n}^{1}(x^{i} - y^{i})^{2} <$. This is a definable set, and hence a semialgebraic set. simple.

IV.24 Stochastic Processes

Jean-François Le Gall

1 Historical Introduction

Stochastic processes are one of the major themes ofmodern probability theory. Roughly speaking, they are mathematical models that describe the evolution ofrandom phenomena as time goes by. In this article, we shall introduce and illustrate the fundamental ideas ofthe theory of stochastic processes by concentrating on the single most important example: Brownian motion. We start with a brief historical introduction, in order toprovide some motivation for the mathematical theory that follows. In 1828, the British botanist Robert Brown observed the very irregular and wiggly motion of small particlesof pollen suspended in water. Brown pointed out the unpredictable character of the motion, which appearedto obey no known physical rule. During the nineteenth century, several physicists tried to understand the ori-gin of this “Brownian motion,” which turned out to be present in many other physical phenomena. several theories were proposed, some of them rather fanciful: perhaps Brownian particles were living microscopic animals, or perhaps the motion was due to electro-static forces. By the end of the century, however, physicists had concluded that the constant changes of direc-tion in Brownian motion could be explained by the impacts on a particle from the molecules of the sur-rounding medium. If the particle was sufficiently light, then these numerous collisions could have a macroscopic influence on its displacement. This explanation was also consistent with the experimental observation that the motion became faster if the temperature of thewater, and thus the thermal agitation of its molecules, increased. Albert Einstein, in one of his three famous 1905 papers, was responsible for a major step forward inthe understanding of Brownian motion. He worked out that if a Brownian particle starts at the origin, thenafter a fixed timet its position should be randomly dis- tributed according to the (three-dimensional)[III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions) with mean 0 and variance gaussian$σ2t$, distribution where$σ^{2} \text{is a constant}$, \text{called the}diffusion constant, that measures how quickly the distribution spreads out with time. (One can think of this loosely as the speed of the Brownian motion, but we shall see later

647

that the word “speed” is not really appropriate.) Ein-stein’s method was based on considerations of statistical physics, which led him to the heat equation [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and then to the Gaussian density that solves this equation (see section 5.2). cian Louis Bachelier, in his work about the mathemat-ical modeling of stock markets, had already noticed A few years before Einstein, the French mathemat i the Gaussian distribution of Brownian motion. How-ever, Bachelier was dealing not with the physical phenomenon known as Brownian motion, but rather with random walks where the step size was very small. As we shall see in sections 2 and 3, the two concepts are essentially equivalent from a mathematical viewpoint.Bachelier pointed out what we call today the Markov property displacement after timeof Brownian motion: if we wish to predict thet of a Brownian particle, then knowledge of the path followed by the particle before timethe position at timet does not help us any more than just knowingt. Bachelier’s arguments were not completely satisfactory, and his ideas were not fully appreciated in his time. How does one go about modeling a particle that moves in a random way? A first remark is that the posi-tion of the particle at timet will be a random variable [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions)B . But these random variables will depend ont

each other: if you know where the particle is at timet, it will affect your knowledge of how likely it is to be ina certain region at some later time. These two considerations can be accommodated if we take as our basic model a set of random variables B , one for each non-t

negative real number, all defined on the same underly-ing probability space. This, formally speaking, is what a stochastic process is.This may seem a rather simple definition, but in order for a stochastic process to be interesting it needs tohave additional properties, and difficult mathematical questions arise as soon as one tries to obtain them. Let us writeeach of the random variablesΩ for the underlying probability space. Then Bt is a function from Ω to R3, and therefore we associate a point in R3 with each pair(t, ω) (where t is a positive real number and ω belongs toability distribution ofΩ). So far we have thought about the prob-Bt, so we have been focusing on what happens when we fixwe must also consider what happens when we look att and let ω vary. However, a “single instance” of a stochastic process, by fixingω and lettingto Bt(ω) \text{is called at}vary. For fixed sample pathω, the function that takes. If we want a rigoroust mathematical theory of Brownian motion, then a very

648

important property it should satisfy is that all the sam-ple paths are continuous: that is, for fixedω the point B^t (ω)Physical observations, as well as the contributions ofdepends continuously on t. Einstein and Bachelier described above, suggested a fewother properties that Brownian motion should satisfy. It then became a substantial mathematical problem toprove that there existed a stochastic process with those properties. Wiener was the first person to establish this, which he did in 1923, and for this reason the mathematical concept of Brownian motion is sometimes calledthe Wiener process. the twentieth century, including The most famous names of probability theory in kolmogorov [VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987), Lévy, Itô, and Doob, all made important contributions to the study of Brownian motion. Detailed properties of the sample paths have received particular attention, ever since the physicist Jean Perrin observed that these functions are nowhere differentiable (despite Wiener’slater result that they were continuous). The nondifferentiab ility of Brownian trajectories led Itô to introduce a differential calculus for functions of brownian motion and more general stochastic processes. This Itô stochastic calculus, which will be briefly presentedin section 4, has found many applications in many different areas of modern probability theory. 2 Coin Tossing and Random Walks One of the easiest ways to understand Brownian motionis via another important concept of probability: that ofwhere you repeatedly tossed a coin, winning random walks. Suppose you were to play a game€1 if it came up heads, and losing €1 if it came up tails. One could then define a sequence of random variables gain (which could well be negative) after S0$, S1$, S2, . . . , where Sn represented your totaln tosses of the coin. Two simple properties of this sequence arethat S must be 0 and that S and S-always differ by 1. One can see this in figure 1, which plots a graphof the sequence in the case where the coin tosses are0(nn)1 HTTTHTHHHTHHTH .... sequence of random variables A third property becomes clear if one defines anotherε1, ε2, . . . , representing the outcome of each toss of the coin. These are inde-pendent, and eachεn takes the value 1 with probability12 and-1 \text{with probabilit}(y1)2. Moreover, \text{for each} n \text{we can write} Sn = ε1 + · · · + εn. \text{The distribution of sums of this kind depends in a very simple way on the well}-\text{known binomial distribution} [III.71 §1](/part - 03/probability - distributions).

(It turns out to be easy to construct a stochastic process that satisfies all the properties above apart fromthe second; the difficulty is in obtaining the continuity of the sample paths.) Another important remark is thatthe above properties characterize Brownian motion: any two stochastic processes with those properties are essentially the same.

For example, as we have already seen, the probability that S(n)(1) \text{lies between a and} b converges$to$\sqrt{21π}a b (e-x()2()/){2} dx.

For The convergence of random walks to Brownian moin stance, we can allow other probability distributions for the individual steps of the random walk. A typical result is that if each individual step has mean 0(as is the case when we have$+1 or - 1 \text{with probabil}-$ ity 12 ) and finite variance, then the limiting process will always be a simple rescaling of Brownian motion. In thissense Brownian motion appears as a universal object: it is the continuous limit of a wide range of discrete models. (See the introduction to probabilistic models of critical phenomenaof universality.) [IV.25] for a discussion ian motion, let us think about how to model random Now that we have discussed one-dimensional brown continuous paths in three dimensions. An obvious wayof doing it would be to take three independent Brownian motions, coordinates of a point in a random path in$(B1)t$, (Bt)2$, and (Bt)3$, and let these be the three R3. And

Figure 4 Simulation of planar Brownian motion. indeed, this is how three-dimensional Brownian motionis defined. However, it is not quite so obvious that this is a good definition. In particular, it seems to depend on our choice of coordinate system, which is worryingif we want a good model for physical Brownian motion. However, a central property of higher-dimensional Brownian motion (the definition just given clearly gen-eralizes to any dimensiond) is rotational invariance. That is, if we choose a different[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) as our coordinate system, then we obtain the orthonormal basis same stochastic process. The proof of this is a simple deduction from the basic fact that the density function one-dimensional Gaussian random variables is[III.71 §3](/part-03/probability-distributions) of a vector made up ofd independent(2π)1 d/2 (e-)((x2)1+···+x 2 d)/2.

This helps to explain why mathematical Brownian motion is a good model for the physical phe-nomenon observed by Brown: the erratic displacements caused by collisions with molecules resemble the stepsof a random walk with very small step size.

Now it is not obvious that this will still be a good esti-mate. The reason is that, typically, the random walk will have gone backwards and forwards, covering the same ground several times before reaching its eventual destination tions a chance to accumulate. To see that this is a seri-$x^{n}$, and this gives the errors in the approxima- ous problem, consider the very well-behaved functionf (x) = x2 and let x = 0. In this case, f ((xj)+1)0- f (xj) = (x2()j)+1 - (xj)2 and a simple calculation shows that this is equal to $((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})2x^{j} + ((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})^{2}$. The first term here equals therefore the approximation that we are considering, so$((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})f^ (x^{j}) \text{and is}$ the error we have to worry about isis the square of the step size of the random walk. In$((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})^{2}$, which other words, it is 1 so the total error (all of which is positive) is 1. Since the/n.

All we have to do is use one more term in the Tay-lor expansion. That is, we use the slightly more refined approximation $f ((x^{j})^{+1}) - f (x^{j}) = ((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})f^ (x^{j})+^{1}^{2}((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})^{2}f^ (x^{j})$.

(Of course, now we are assuming that thetivef^   exists and is continuous.) Notice that in thesecond deriva- examplef (x) = x2 \text{just considered}$, f^ (x) = 2 \text{for everyx}$, and so if we add up all the above approx- imations we get exactly the right answer. In general, as this observation would suggest, one can show that f (xn) - f (x0) \text{is well} - \text{approximated byn}-1((xj)+1 - xj)f^ (xj) + (1 n)-1((xj)+1 - xj)2 f^ (xj).j=0 2 j=0

Now let us think about what happens to these two sums if we allow our random walks to converge to a Brownian motion Bt. A relatively straightforward argu- ment, based on the fact that$((x^{j})^{+1} - x^{j})^{2} \text{is just the}$ reciprocal of the number of steps, shows that the lim-iting distribution of the second sum exists and is given by the integral first sum should also converge to a limit, which indeed12 0 t f^  (Bs )ds. This suggests that the it does: the limit is called thewrittent f^ (B ) d B . More precisely, one ends up with stochastic integral and is$\text{the formula}0$ ssf (Bt) = f (B0) +0 t f^ (Bs) d Bs + 1(20)t f^  (Bs) ds, (1) which is known as Itô’s formula. Note the similarity to the fundamental theorem of calculus. The main differ-ence is the extra term involving the second derivative, the so-called Itô term. wish to estimate the difference between two values of afunction by integrating its derivative, why not choose a Why, one might wonder, is this interesting? If we smooth path rather than a very wiggly one? The point, however, is that we are not interested in just one path. For any fixed sample path, the two sides of the above formula are just numbers, but if we think ofdom variable, then they too become random variables.Bt as a ran- And since both sides are defined for all$t ⩾ 0$, they are actually stochastic processes. So what we are discussing is a way of integrating one stochastic processto produce another.

tic integrals have properties that allow one to prove The reason Itô’s formula is so useful is that stoc has many facts about them. In particular, if we view the stochastic integralt f^ (B )d B \text{as a collection of ran}- dom variables indexed by the parameter0 ss t, \text{then we} have a stochastic process of an especially nice sort called a martingale. A martingale is a stochastic process(Mt ()t()⩾){0} with the property that, whenever s ⩽ t, the expected value of M \text{for all} r ⩽ s, \text{is just MM}t, conditional on the values of.r Brownian motion is a particularly simple kind of mar-s tingale, but martingales are much more general because M - M is not independent of the values of M withrgiven those values, is zero. Here is an example that illus-t⩽ s: all one knows is that the expectation ofs (Mt)r-Ms, trates the difference: start running Brownian motion at0; when it first reaches 1 (if it ever does), continue with Brownian motion but at double the speed (or rather, double the diffusion constant).

The precise result is that there exists another Brownian motion$β = (β ) \text{such that}$, \text{for every} t ⩾ 0,(tt()⩾){0}t

This is in fact true for any continuous martingale—not0$f^ (B^{s} )dB^{s} = β^{0}^{t}^{f}^{(}(B^{s})^{(})^{2}()^{d})^{s}$. just one given by a stochastic integral—and the relevant time change is a quantity called the quadratic variation of the martingale. Therefore, the graph of a continuous martingale is obtained from that of a brownian motion by a time-change operation.

For instance, the electrical potential of a conductor in equilibrium is a harmonic function outside the conductor. And ifthe temperature of the boundary of a body is kept fixed (that is, although different parts of the boundary may have different temperatures, these tempera-tures do not change over time), then the equilibrium temperature inside the body is also a harmonic func-tion. (See the discussion of the heat equation in the next section.)Harmonic functions have a very close relationship with Brownian motion, which leads to one of the most important connections between probability and analy-sis. This connection is already apparent from the fact that$Mf$, defined in the previous section, is a martin$t$ gale. It follows from this thath(B ) is a martingale ift

(and in fact only if)h is harmonic, since then the sec- ond term vanishes. However, we will explain the link between Brownian motion and harmonic functions in a more elementary way, from the classical lem. Let U be a bounded open set, and let Dirichlet prob-g be a contin- uous real-valued function defined on the boundaryof$U$. The classical Dirichlet problem is to find a func-∂U tion boundary.h that is harmonic on U and is equal to g on the tion in terms of Brownian motion: take Brownian motion from The Dirichlet problem has a remarkably simple solu-x, and evaluate xg at the point\in  U, start a Bτ where this Brownian motion leaves U$(\text{see figure} 5)$; then define does this work?

Therefore, sincex is very likely to leaveg is continuous, the average value U at a point close to$of$ gat the first exit point will be close to the value of g at any point near To show that h is harmonic is more interesting. Letx.xr be a point inabout x is contained in U and suppose that the ball of radius U. We would like to show thath(x) equals the average value of h on the bound- ary of this ball. Nowat the point where a Brownian motion that starts ath(x) is the average value of xg leaveson the first point U. Let us work out this average by conditioning B where the Brownian path leaves the ball of radius$r$(see figure 5). \text{By the rotational invari}-T ance of Brownian motion, this point will be evenly dis-tributed around the boundary of this ball. If we reach the boundary at a pointg when the path leaves Uy, then the average value of(conditioning on this extra information) ish(y), by definition. Therefore, h(x) is indeed the average value ofball of radiusr . h on the boundary of the is a subtlety concealed within it, connected with thefact that a Brownian path will typically cross the bound-Convincing though this argument might seem, there ary of the ball many times. Suppose we tried a similar argument, but this time we conditioned on the value at thepoint wa sl as ty point where the path left the ball. If this, we could not then say that the expected value ofgwhere the path first reached the boundary of Uwould be forbidden to enter the ball again, and wouldwas h(y) because from that point onward the path therefore not be a Brownian motion.Recall that the Markov property of a Brownian motion states that, given a fixed time T < t, the value of B -B is independent of T and another time B for st with⩽ T. It may seem that we are applying this principle in the argument above, takingt T Tto be the first time that thes Brownian motion reaches the boundary of the ball. Butif we do that, then Tis not a fixed time since it depends on the Brownian motion. However, the argument canstill be made to work because T is a so-called stopping timewhat the Brownian motion does after. Informally, this means that T does not depend on T . (Therefore the last time it leaves the ball of radiusr is not a stopping time, because whether or not a given time is this lasttime depends on the subsequent behavior of the Brownian motion.) Brownian motion can be shown to have thestrong Markov property, which is like the usual Markov property except that T is allowed to be a stopping time. Given this fact, it is not hard to show rigorously thatis harmonic. h654 5.2 \text{The Heat Equation Letf be a function on Rd} (\text{which we shall assume to be continuous and bounded}). \text{If we think ofperature distribution at time} 0, \text{then the heat equa} - f \text{as a tem}- \text{tionat subsequent times}. \text{To find a solution to this equation}[III.36](/part - 03/the - heat - equation) \text{models what happens to the temperature with initial valueu}(t, x), defined for everyfmeans to find a continuous functiont ⩾ 0 and x \in  Rd, that solves the partial differential equation

As usual, wef = f + if be a Then the real part holomorphic functionf and the imaginary part[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) defined on$f1 \text{of Cf}2$. are both harmonic functions, so thatare martingales.

As we saw in section 3, each of the two process esf (B ) can be expressed as a time change of a linear Brownian motion stronger result can also be proved, namely that the timejt βj. However, a change is the same in both cases and that the brownian motionsβ1 and β2 are independent. This makes it pos- sible to prove a “localized” rotational invariance, which leads to the importantof Brownian motion. Roughly speaking, this states that conformal invariance property the image of a planar Brownian motion under a con-formal (that is, angle-preserving) mapping is another planar Brownian motion run at a different speed. 6 Stochastic Differential Equations Imagine a Brownian particle in some water. If the tem-perature of the water rises, then we expect there to be more collisions with faster-moving molecules; this canbe modeled easily by increasing the diffusion constant. But what if the temperature in the water varied fromplace to place? Then the particle would be more agitated in some parts of the water than in others. Andif the water was moving, with different parts moving at different speeds, then one would need to superimpose on the Brownian motion a “drift” term, to take into account that on average we would expect the particle to move with the surrounding water.Stochastic differential equations are used to model more complicated situations like this. Let us begin by considering the one-dimensional case. Letσ and b be two functions (which we shall assume to be continuous)defined on R. We think ofσ (x) as telling us the rate of diffusion atthe sake of a picture, one could think ofx and of b(x) as the drift atσ (x)xas the.

7 Random Trees

Brownian motion and more general diffusion processes appear as limits of many discrete models in probability theory, combinatorics, and statistical physics. The most striking recent example of this is given by the so-called stochastic Loewner evolution (commonly abbreviated to SLE) processes, which are discussed in [IV.25 §5]). Theseare expected to describe the asymptotic behavior of a large number of two-dimensional models, and their definition involves both linear Brownian motion and the Loewner equation from complex analysis. Rather than trying to give a general presentation of the relationship between Brownian motion and discrete models, in this final section we shall discuss a surprising application of Brownian motion to random trees, which can be used to describe the genealogy of a population. with a single “ancestor,” which we label place a probability distribution The basic discrete model is the following. We start\mu on the nonnegative∅. Then we integers, and use this to determine the number of chil-dren the ancestor has. Then each child is assumed to have children, the numbers of children being indepen-dent and also determined by the probability distributionμ. And so on. The case that we shall be inter- ested in is the so-called number of children is exactly 1 (and the variance iscritical case, where the expected finite). labeled tree, called the We can represent the outcome of this process as a genealogical tree, in a natural way. To draw the tree one simply joins each member ofthe population to its children. As for the labels, the children of the original ancestor are labeled 1,2, . . . , \text{left to} right, the children of 1 are labeled children of 2 are labeled(2,1), (2,2), . . .(1,1), ($, \text{and so on}$.

However, our goal is to understand the shape of thetree when it is “conditioned to be large.” This is a bit like the difference between on the one hand picking a random person alive one thousand years ago and looking at the tree of all his or her descendants, and on the other hand looking at the tree of a random ancestor, alive one thousand years ago, of an individ-ual who is alive today. In the latter case the tree is guaranteed to continue for many generations without dying out. rather the population it represents) survives for Suppose we condition on the event that the treenθgen-(or erations. We may now ask all sorts of questions aboutthis genealogical tree. How many individuals are there in a given generation of the tree? If we pick two individuals in the same generation, how far do we typically have to go back in the tree to reach a common ancestor? Asymptotic answers to such questions are also of interest in computer science and in combinatorics. the event thattree is called We will condition on a slightly different event, namely$θθ^{n}$.

How-ever, we can use Brownian motion in a simple way to define a notion called a Brownian excursion, for which the sample paths have the right shape.

IV.25. Probabilistic Models of Critical Phenomena a large critical Galton–Watson tree does not depend onthe offspring distribution. This is another example of universality.This result and variants of it provide a lot of useful information about the asymptotic behavior of large trees. Many interesting functions of the tree can berewritten in terms of the contour function and by Aldous’s theorem they will converge to similar func-tions of the Brownian excursion, whose distribution can be computed explicitly with the help of stochastic cal-culus. To give just one example, this technique can be used to calculate the limiting distribution of the heightof the treeθn.

How does it occur so suddenly?

1.2 Theory

The mathematical theory of critical phenomena is cur-rently under going intense development. Intertwined with the science of phase transitions, it draws on ideas from probability theory and statistical physics. Thetheory is inherently probabilistic: each possible configuration of the system (e.g., a particular arrangement ofpores in a rock, or of the magnetic states of the individual atoms in a block of iron) is assigned a probability, and the typical behavior of this ensemble of random configurations is analyzed as a function of parameters of the system (e.g., porosity or temperature). large degree by a profound insight from physics knownas The theory of critical phenomena is now guided to a universality, which, at present, is more of a philosophy than a mathematical theorem. The notion of universality refers to the fact that many essential fea-tures of the transition at a critical point depend on relatively few attributes of the system under consid-eration. In particular, simple mathematical models can

658

capture some of the qualitative and quantitative fea-tures of critical behavior in real physical systems even if the models dramatically oversimplify the local interac-tions present in the real systems. This observation has helped to focus attention on particular mathematical models, among both physicists and mathematicians. nomena that have attracted much attention from math-This essay discusses several models of critical ph ee maticians, namely branching processes, the model ofrandom networks known as the random graph, the percolation model, the Ising model of ferromagnetism, andthe random cluster model. As well as having applications, these models are mathematically fascinating.Deep theorems have been proved, but many problems of central importance remain unsolved and tantalizing conjectures abound. 2 Branching Processes Branching processes provide perhaps the simplest example of a phase transition. They occur naturally asa model of the random evolution of a population that changes in time as a result of births and deaths. The simplest branching process is defined as follows. that reproduces immediately before death. The organ-Consider an organism that lives for a unit time and ism has two potential offspring, which we can regardas the “left” offspring and the “right” offspring. At the moment of reproduction, the organism has either no offspring, a left but no right offspring, a right but no left offspring, or both a left and a right offspring. Assume that each of the potential offspring has a probability of being born and that these two births occur inde-$p$ pendently. Here, the numberand 1, is a measure of the population’s fecundity. Sup-$p$, \text{which lies between} 0 pose that we start with a single organism at time zero, and that each descendant of this organism reproduces independently in the above manner. A possible family tree is depicted in figure 1, showing all births that occurred. In this family tree, ten offspring were produced in all, but twelve potential offspring were not born, so the probability of this particular tree occurring is$p^{1}0(1 - p)^{1}2$.$If$ p =$0$, then no offspring are born, and the family tree always consists of the original organism only.If$p =$1, then all possible offspring are born, the family tree is the infinite binary tree, and the population always survives forever. For intermediate values ofp, the population may or may not survive forever: letθ(p)

Since an organism has each of two potential offspring independently with probabilityp, it has, on average, 2 for all time will not occur ifp offspring. It is natural to suppose that survival$p <^{1}$, since then each organism, on average, produces less than 1 offspring.On the other hand, if$p >1$, then, on average, organ-2 isms more than replace themselves, and it is plausi-2 ble that a population explosion can lead to survival forall time. Branching processes have a recursive nature, not present in other models, that facilitates explicit com-putation. Exploiting this, it is possible to show that the survival probability is given by$⎧⎪⎪⎨0 if p ⩽^{1}^{2}$,θ(p) =⎪⎪⎩ p12 (2 p - 1) if p ⩾1 2.

2.2 Critical Exponents and Universality

Some aspects of the above discussion are specific totwofold branching, and will change for a branching process with higher-order branching. For example, if each organism has not two butagain independently with probabil i tym potential offspring, p, then the aver- age number of offspring per organism ismp and the critical probability las written above for the survival probability, for thepc changes to 1/m. Also, the formu- probability of at leastk descendants, and for the aver- age family size must all be modified and will involve the parameterm. However, the way thatθ(p) goes to zero at the critical point, the way that Pk(pc) goes to zero as k goes to infinity, and the way thatp approaches the critical pointχ(p) pdiverges to infinity aswill all be governed c by exponents that are independent ofm. To be more specific, they behave in the following manner: $θ(p) ∼ C^{1}(p - p^{c})^{β}$, as p \to  p+c$, Pk(pc) ∼ C2k - 1^{/}δ$, as k → $\i\text{nf ty}$,χ(p) ∼ C3(pc - p()-)γ$, as p \to p - c$.

Here, the numbers$C^{1}$, C2, and C3 \text{are constants that} depend ontake on the same values for everym. By contrast, the exp one ntsm ⩾ 2. Indeed, thoseβ, δ, and γ values areβ = 1, δ = 2, and γ = 1. \text{They are called} critical exponents, and they are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the precise form of the law that governs how the individual organisms repro-duce. Related exponents will appear below in other models.

3 Random Graphs

An active research field in discrete mathematics withmany applications is the study of objects known as graphsas the Internet, the World Wide Web, and highway net-[III.34]. These are used to model systems such works. Mathematically, atices (which might represent computers, Web pages, orgraph is a collection of vercities) joined in pairs bybetween computers, hyperlinks between Web pages, edges (physical connections highways). Graphs are also called networks, vertices are also calledor bonds. nodes or sites, and edges are also called links

3.1 The Basic Model of a Random Graph

A major subarea of graph theory, initiated by Erd ̋Rényi in 1960, concerns the properties that a graph typ-os and ically has when it has been generated randomly. A nat-ural way to do this is to taken vertices and for each pair to decide randomly (by the toss of a coin, say) whether it should be linked by an edge. More generally, one can choose a numberp between 0 and 1 and letp be the probability that any given pair is linked. (This would correspond to using a biased coin to make the decisions.) The properties of random graphs come into their own whenthe fact that there is a phase transition.n is large, and of particular interest is 3.2 \text{The Phase Transition Ifto}xyandis a sequence of vertices that starts withy are vertices in a graph, then a path fromx andx ends withy in such a way that neighboring terms of the sequence are joined by edges. (If the vertices are represented by points and the edges by lines, then a path is a way of getting fromthe lines.) Ifx and y are joined by a path, then theyx to y by traveling along are said to becluster, in a graph is what you obtain if you take a vertex connected. A component, or connected together with all the other vertices that are connected to it.Any graph decomposes naturally into its connected clusters. These will, in general, have different sizes (asmeasured by the number of vertices), and given a graph it is interesting to know the size of its largest cluster, which we shall denote byrandom graph withn vertices, then the value of N. If we are considering a N will depend on the multitude of random choices made whenthe graph was generated, and thus N is itself a ran- dom variable. The possible values of N are everything

from 1, the value it takes when no edges are present and every cluster consists of a single vertex, ton, when there is just one connected cluster consisting of all the vertices. In particular, N = 1 when p = 0$, and N = n$ whenp = 1. At a certain point between these extremes, N undergoes a dramatic jump.

It is possible to guess where the jump might take place, by considering the This means the number of degree neighbors of a typical vertexofx, that is, otherx. vertices that are directly linked to Each vertex hasn - 1 potential neighbors, and for eachx by a single edge. one the probability that it is an actual neighbor isso the expected degree of any given vertex is p(n - 1 p),. When$p \text{is less than} 1/(n - 1)$, each vertex has, on aver- age, less than one neighbor, whereas when1$/(n - 1)$, it has, again on average, more than one. Thisp exceeds suggests thatp = 1/(n-1) will be a critical value, with c N being small when p is below p , and large when p is c above This is indeed the case. If we set$p^{c}$. p = 1/(n - 1) and c write$p = p (1 + ε)$, with εa fixed number between c -1 and +1, then ε = p(n - 1) - 1. Since p(n - 1) is the average degree of each vertex, how much the average degree differs from 1.

The small clusters present fora subcritical phase, whereas in the so-calledp < pc correspond to what is called super cr it i- cal phase, where$p > p$, there is a “giant cluster” whose c size is of the same order of magnitude as the entire graph (see figure 4). It is interesting to consider the “evolution” of the random graph, ascritical values. (Here one can imagine more and morep is increased from subcritical to super- edges being randomly added to the graph.) A remarkable coalescence occurs, in which many smaller clusters

The hundreds of edges in the graphs are not clearly shown. rapidly merge into a giant cluster whose size is proportional to the size of the entire system. The coales-cence is thorough, in the sense that in the supercritical phase the giant cluster dominates everything: indeed, the second-largest cluster is known to have asymptotic size only 2ε-2 \log n, which makes it far smaller than the giant cluster.

3.3 Cluster Size

For branching processes, we defined the quantityχ(p) to be the average size of the family tree spawned by an

individual when the probability of each potential off-spring being born wasp. By analogy, for the random graph it is natural to take an arbitrary vertexv and define cluster containingχ(p) to be the average size of the connect edv. Since all the vertices play iden- tical roles, of$v$. If we fix a value ofχ(p) is independent of the particular choiceε$, set p = p (1 + ε)$, and let n c tend to infinity, it turns out that the behavior ofis described by the formula$χ(p)⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨1/|ε| if ε < 0$,χ(p) ∼ ⎪⎪⎪⎩c(n1()/){3} if ε = 0, 4$ε2n if ε > 0$,

whereis independent ofc is a constant. Thus the expected cluster sizen when ε < 0, grows like (n1()/){3} whenp = p, and is much larger—indeed, of the same order c of magnitude nas the entire system—when$ε > 0$. let To continue the analogy with branching processes, Pk(p) denote the probability that the cluster con- taining the arbitrary vertextices. Again this does not depend on the particularv consists of at least k ver- choice ofv . In the subcritical phase, when p = p (1+ε) c for some fixed negative value ofε, the probability Pk(p) is essentially independent ofsmall ink. Thus, large clusters are extremely rare. How-n and is exponentially ever, at the critical point$\sqrt{p} = p^{c}$, Pk(p) decays like a multiple of 1 This much slower square-root decay is similar to what/ k (for an appropriate range of k). happens for branching processes.

3.4 Other Thresholds

It is not only the largest cluster size that jumps. An-other quantity that does so is the probability that a random graph is connected, meaning that there is a single connected cluster that contains all thetices. For what values of the edge-probabilityp nis thisver- likely? It is known that the property of being connected has a sharp threshold, at p = (1/n) \log n, \text{in the} \text{following sense}.

Thus, percolation occurs when p > p \text{but not when} p < p, and the system’s behavior changes abruptly at the critical value. A deeper argu-ment shows that whencp > pc there must be exactly one c infinite cluster; infinite clusters cannot coexist on Zd. This is analogous to the situation in the random graph, where one giant cluster dominates whenp is above the critical value.

To do so, and to establish their values, is a major open problem in mathematics, one of central importance for percolation theory.In view of this, it is important to be aware of a prediction from theoretical physics that the exponents are not independent, but are related to each other by whatare called scaling relations. Three scaling relations areγ = (2 - η)\nu$, γ + 2β = β(δ + 1)$, d\nu = γ + 2β.

4.3 Universality

Since the critical exponents describe large-scale behav-ior, it seems plausible that they might depend only weakly on changes in the fine structure of the model. In fact, it is a further prediction of theoretical physics, one that has been verified by numerical experiments, that the critical exponents arethat they depend on the spatial dimension universal, in the sensed but on little else.For example, if the two-dimensional lattice Z2 is replaced by another two-dimensional lattice, such as the triangular or the hexagonal lattice, then the values of the critical exponents are believed not to change.Another modification, for general d ⩾ 2, \text{is to replace} \text{the standard percolation model with the so} - called 664 spread-\text{out modelof Zd is enriched so that now two vertices are joined}. \text{In the spread}-\text{out model}, \text{the edge set whenever they are separated by a distance ofwhere} L ⩾1 \text{is a fixed finite parameter}, \text{usually taken} L \text{or less}, \text{to be large}. \text{Universality suggests that the critical expo}-\text{nents for percolation in the spread}-\text{out model do not depend on the parameter The discussion so far falls within the general frame} - L. \text{work of bond percolation}, \text{in which it is bonds} (edges) \text{that are randomly occupied or vacant}.

Although the critical value for site percola-tion is different from the critical value for bond percolation, it is a prediction of universality that site and bond percolation on Zd have the same critical exponents. ing: the large-scale properties of the phase transition described by critical exponents appear to be insensitive These predictions are mathematically very intriguto the fine details of the model, in contrast to features like the value of critical probability heavily on such details. pc, \text{which depends been proved to exist}, \text{and their values rigorously com} - puted, \text{only for certain percolation models in dimen}-\text{At the time of writing}, \text{the critical exponents have sionsd} = 2 and d > 6, \text{while a general mathematical} \text{understanding of universality remains an elusive goal}. 4.4 \text{Percolation in Dimensions} d > 6

The scaling relations play an important role in theproof, but an essential additional step requires understanding of a concept known as the To get some idea of what this is, let us look at the scaling limit. so-calledure 6. In figure 6, hexagons represent vertices of the tri-exploration process, which is depicted in fig angular lattice. Hexagons in the bottom row have been colored gray on the left half and white on the right half. The other hexagons have been chosen to be gray orwhite independently with probability 1, which is the critical probability for site percolation on the triangu-lar lattice. It is not hard to show that there is a path,2 also illustrated in figure 6, which starts at the bottom and all along its length is gray to the left and white tothe right. The exploration process is this random path, which can be thought of as the gray/white interface.The boundary conditions at the bottom force it to be infinite.The exploration process provides information about the boundaries separating large critical clusters of dif-ferent color, and from this it is possible to extract

It is the macro-scopic large-scale structure that is essential, so interest is focused on the exploration process in the limitas the spacing between vertices of the triangular lattice goes to zero. In other words, what does the curve in figure 6 typically look like in the limit as the size of the hexagons shrinks to zero? It is now known that this limit is described by a newly discovered stochastic process tion (SLE) with parameter six, or SLE[IV.24 §1](/part-04/stochastic-processes) called the Schramm–Loewner evolu-6 for short. The SLE processes were introduced by Schramm in 2000, and have become a topic of intense current research activity. of two-dimensional site percolation on the triangular This is a major step forward in the understanding lattice, but much remains to be done. In particular, it isstill an unsolved problem to prove universality. There is currently no proof that critical exponents exist for bond percolation on the square lattice Z2, although universality predicts that the critical exponents for the square lattice should also take on the interesting values listed above.

4.5.2 Crossing Probabilities

In order to understand two-dimensional percolation, itis very helpful to understand the probability that there will be a path from one side of a region of the plane to another, especially when the parameter critical valuepc. p takes its region in the plane (i.e., a region with no holes), andfix two arcs on the boundary of the region. The To make this idea precise, fix a simply connected crossing probability (which depends onp) is the probability that

In the lower fig-The two regions are related by a conformal transures, the limiting critical crossing probabilities are identi-cal. there is an occupied path inside the region that joins one arc to the other, or more accurately the limit ofthis probability as the lattice spacing between vertices is reduced to zero. Formuch larger than the correlation length p < pc, clusters with diameterξ(p) (measured by the number of steps in the lattice) are extremely rare. However, to cross the region, a cluster needs to belarger and larger as the lattice spacing goes to zero. It follows that the crossing probability is 0. Whenthere is exactly one infinite cluster, from which it can p > pc, be deduced that if the lattice spacing is very small, thenwith very high probability there will be a crossing of the region. In the limit, the crossing probability is 1.

5.1 Spins, Energy, and Temperature

In the Ising model, a block of iron is regarded as a col-lection of atoms whose positions are fixed in a crystalline lattice. Each atom has a magnetic “spin,” which isassumed for simplicity to point upward or downward.

Each possible configuration of spins has an associated energy, and the greater this energy is, the less likely the configuration is to occur. their immediate neighbors, and the energy reflects this: it increases according to the number of pairs of neigh-On the whole, atoms like to have the same spin as boring spins that arethere is an external magnetic field, also assumed to benot aligned with each other. If directed up or down, then there is an additional contri-bution: atoms like to be aligned with the external field, and the energy is greater the more spins there are thatare not aligned with it. Since configurations with higher energy are less likely, spins have a general tendency to align with each other, and also to align with the direc-tion of the external magnetic field. When a larger fraction of spins points up than down, the iron is said tohave a positive magnetization. Although energy considerations favor configurations with many aligned spins, there is a competing effect.As the temperature increases, there are more random thermal fluctuations of the spins, and these diminish the amount of alignment. Whenever there is an external magnetic field, the energy effects predominate and there is at least some magnetization, however high the temperature. However, when the external field is turned off, the magnetization persists only if the tempera-ture is below a certain critical temperature. Above this temperature, the iron will lose its magnetization. tures the above picture. The crystalline lattice is mod-eled by the lattice The Ising model is a mathematical model that cap-Zd.

These critical exponents, like those for percolation, are predicted to be universal and to obey various scaling relations. They are now understood mathematically inall dimensions except$d = 3$. 5.4 \text{Exact Solution for}d = 2

In 1944, Onsager published a famous paper in whichhe gave an exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model. His remarkable computation is a landmark inthe development of the theory of critical phenomena. With the exact solution as a starting point, critical expo-nents could be calculated. As with two-dimensional percolation, the exponents take interesting values:

$β =^{1}^{8}$, γ =7 4$, δ = 15$. 5.5 Mean-\text{Field Theory for}$d ⩾ 4$

Two modifications of the Ising model are relatively easyto analyze. One is to formulate the model on the infinite binary tree, rather than on the integer lattice Zd. Another is to formulate the Ising model on the so-called “complete graph,” which is the graph consisting ofvertices with an edge joining every pair of vertices, and$n$ then take the limit asknown as the Curie–Weiss modelngoes to infinity. In the latter,, each spin interacts equally with all the other spins, or, put another way, each spin feels theeach of these modifications, the critical exponents takemean field of all the other spins. In on the so-called mean-field values

$β =1 2$, γ = 1, δ = 3.

Ingenious methods have been used to prove that the Ising model on Zd has these same critical exponents in dimensionsd ⩾ 4, \text{although in dimension} 4 there remain unresolved issues concerning logarithmic corrections to the asymptotic formulas.

IV.25. Probabilistic Models of Critical Phenomena 6 The Random-Cluster Model The percolation and Ising models appear to be quite different. A percolation configuration consists of a random subgraph of a given graph (usually a lattice asin the examples earlier), with edges included independently with probability model consists of an assignment of values$p$. A configuration of the Ising$±1 \text{to spins}$ at the vertices of a graph (again usually a lattice), \text{withthese spins influenced by energy and temperature}. \text{and Kasteleyn had the insight to observe that the twomodels are in fact closely related to each other}, \text{as mem}-\text{In spite of these differences}, \text{in around} 1970 \text{Fortuin bers of a larger family of models known as the random}-\text{cluster model}. \text{The random}-\text{cluster model also includes a natural extension of the Ising model known as the Potts model In the Potts model}, \text{spins at the vertices of a given}. \text{graphwhereq Gis an integer greater than or equal to} 2. \text{Whenmay take on any one of qdif fer ent values}, q = 2 \text{there are two possible spin values and the model is equivalent to the Ising model}. \text{For general ven ient to label the possible spin values as} 1 q, \text{it is con}-, 2, . . . , q.

The total energy E(σ )of a spin configurationσ, assuming no external field, is the sum of the energies associated with all edges.

In par- ticular, for the choiceq = 1, \text{the random} - \text{cluster model} is the same as bond percolation. Thus the random-cluster model provides a one-parameter family of models, indexed byq = 1, to the Ising model forq, which corresponds to percolation forq = 2, and to the Potts model for integera phase transition for generalq ⩾ 2. The random-cluster model hasq ⩾ 1, and provides a unified setting and a rich family of examples. 7 Conclusion The science of critical phenomena and phase transi-tions is a source of fascinating mathematical problems of real physical significance. Percolation is a central mathematical model in the subject. Often formulated on Z$d$, it can also be defined instead on a tree or on the complete graph, as a result of which it encompasses branching processes and the random graph. The Ising model is a fundamental model of the ferromagnetic phase transition. At first sight unrelated to percolation, it is in fact closely connected within the wider setting ofthe random-cluster model. The latter provides a unified framework and a powerful geometric representation for the Ising and Potts models.Part of the fascination of these models is due to the prediction from theoretical physics that large-scale fea-tures near the critical point are universal. However, proofs often rely on specific details of a model, evenwhen universality predicts that these details should not be essential to the results. For example, the under-standing of critical crossing probabilities and the calculation of critical exponents has been carried out for sitepercolation on the triangular lattice, but not for bond percolation on Z2. Although the progress for the triangular lattice is a triumph of the theory, it is not the lastword. Universality remains a guiding principle but it is not yet a general theorem. sion 3, a very basic feature of percolation and the Ising model is not understood at all: it has not yet been In the physically most interesting case of dimen-

1 Introduction

If you have ever watched a child blowing soap bubbles, then you cannot have failed to notice that the bubbles are, at least as far as the human eye can tell, perfectly spherical. From a mathematical perspective, the reason for this is simple. The surface tension in the soap solu-tion causes each bubble to make its area as small as possible, subject to the constraint that it encloses afixed amount of air (and cannot compress the air too much). The sphere is the surface of smallest area that encloses a given volume. recognized by the ancient Greeks, although fully rig-orous demonstrations did not appear until the end of As a mathematical principle, this seems to have been the nineteenth century. This and similar statements areknown as “isoperimetric principles.”1 refers to the two-dimensional formulation: if a disk and another region have equal perimeter, then the area of the other region cannot be1. The prefix “iso” means “equal.” The name “equal perimeter” larger than that of the disk.

Thus, by minimizing the length of the curve we force it to have a great deal ofsymmetry: the curve should be equally curved every where along its length. In three or more dimensions, many different kinds of curvature [III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) are used in different contexts. One, known asthe appropriate one for area-minimization problems.mean curvature, is point, but then it is pretty clear from its symmetry that the sphere would have the same curvature at every The sphere has the same mean curvature at every point whatever measure of curvature we used. more illustrative examples are provided by the soap films (much more varied than simple bubbles) that are a pop-ular feature of recreational mathematics lectures: figure 1 shows such a soap film stretched across a wireframe. The film adopts the shape that minimizes its area, subject to the constraint that it is bounded by thewire frame. One can show that the minimal surface (the exact mathematical solution to the minimization prob-lem) has constant mean curvature: its mean curvature is the same at every point.Isoperimetric principles turn up all over mathematics: in the study of partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis, computational algorithms, probability theory, and almost every branch of geometry. The aim of the first part of this article is to describe a branch of mathematics, high-dimensional geometry, whose starting point is the fundamental isoperimetric principle: that the sphere is the surface of least area that encloses a given volume. The most remarkable feature of high-dimensional geometryis its intimate connection to the theory of probability: geometric objects in high-dimensional space exhibit many of the characteristic properties of random distributions. The aim of the second part of this article is tooutline the links between the geometry and probability.

IV.26. High-Dimensional Geometry and Its Probabilistic Analogues 2 High-Dimensional Spaces So far we have discussed only two- and three-dimen-sional geometry. Higher-dimensional spaces seem to be impossible for humans to visualize but it is easy to provide a mathematical description of them by extend-ing the usual description of three-dimensional space in terms of Cartesian coordinates. In three dimen-sions, a point(x, y, z) is given by three coordin- ates; in(x , x , . . . , xn-dimensional space, the points are). As in two and three dimensions, then-tuples points are related to one another in that we can add twoof them together to produce a third, by simply adding1 2 n$\text{corresponding coordinates}: (2$, 3, . . . , 7) + (1, 5, . . . , 2) = (3, 8, . . . , 9). By relating points to one another, addition gives the space some structure or “shape.” The space is not justa jumble of unrelated points. also need to specify the distance between any twopoints. In two dimensions, the distance of a point To describe the shape of the space completely, we(x, y) from the origin isx2 + y2 \text{by the Pythagorean theo}- rem (and the fact that the axes are perpendicular). Simi-larly, the distance between two points(u, v) and (x, y)$is$(x - u)2 + (y - v)2.$In$(un, udi men sions we define the distance between points, . . . , u ) and (x , x , . . . , x ) to be 1 2$(n1)2 n(x1 - u1)2 + (x2 - u2)2 + · · · + (xn - un)2$. follows. We start by defining a cube in The two- and three-dimensional cases, the square and Volume is defined inn-dimensional space roughly asn dimensions. the usual three-dimensional cube, are very familiar. Theset of all points in thexy-plane whose coordinates are between 0 and 1 is a square of side 1 unit (as shown infigure 2), and, similarly, \text{the set of all points}(x, y, z) \text{for whichx}, y, and z \text{are all between} 0 and 1 \text{is a unit cube}. \text{Inthose points whose coordinates are all between} 0 and 1.n-\text{dimensional space the analogous cube consists of We stipulate that the unit cube has volume} 1.

One way to see this isn dimensions, n to imagine enlarging the unit ball by a factor slightly greater than 1, say 1$+ ε$. This is pictured in figure 3. The enlarged ball has volumeof the shell between the two spheres is(1 + ε)nvn and so the volume((1 +ε)n -1)v . Since the shell has thickness mately the surface area multiplied byε, this volume is approxi-ε. So the surfacen area is approximately

$(1 + ε)n - 1ε vn$.

By taking the limit assurface area exactly:ε approaches 0 we obtain the\limε\to0 (1 + ε)εn - 1 vn.

One can check that this limit isthe power(1 + ε)n or by observing that the expression nvn either by expanding is the formula for a derivative. space without being too precise about what kind of sets So far we have discussed bodies inn-dimensional we are considering. Many of the statements in this arti-cle hold true for quite general sets.

and each of vol(C)1/n \text{and vol}(D)1/n$\text{is equal to} 1$: the inequality (1) holdsand Dare copies of one another, the Brunn–minkowski with equality. Similarly, whenever$C$ inequality holds with equality. If we omitted the expo-nents 1$/n$, the statement would still be true; in the case of two cubes, it is certainly true that 2$n ⩾ 1 + 1$. \text{But the} statement would be extremely weak: it would give usalmost no useful information. The importance of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality stems from the fact that it is the most fundamental principle relating volume to the operation of addition, which is the operation that gives space its structure.At the start of this section it was explained that Minkowski’s formulation of Brunn’s idea provided a new approach to the isoperimetric principle. Let us see why.Let C be a [III.9](/part-03/compactness-and-compactication) in Rn whose volume is equal to that of the unit ballthe surface area ofcompact set C is at least Bn. We want to show thatvol(B) since this is the surface area of the ball. We consider what happens to$C$ if we add a small ball to it. An example (a right-angled triangle) is shown in figure 5: the dashed curve outlines the enlarged set we obtain by adding toball B scaled by a small factor ε. This looks rather like C a copy of the figure 3 above but here we do not expand the original set, we add a ball. Just as before, the difference between C + εB and C is a shell around C of width ε, so we can express the surface area as a limit asε$approaches 0$: $\lim^{ε} \to 0 vol(C + εB)ε - vol(C)$.

Now the Brunn–Minkowski inequality tells us that vol$(C + εB()^{1})^{/}n ⩾ vol(C()^{1})^{/}n + vol(εB()^{1})^{/}n$.

With a little more sophistication, the same argument can be used to show that the surface of theball, the sphere, has exactly the same property. If a set$C$ occupies half the sphere, then almost all of the sphereis close to that set. This counter intuitive effect turns out to be characteristic of high-dimensional geometry. During the 1980 sa startling probabilistic picture of high-dimensional

space was developed from Lévy’s basic idea. This pic-ture will be sketched in the next section. One can see why the high-dimensional effect has a probabilistic aspect if one thinks about it in a slightly different way. To begin with, let us ask ourselves a basic question: what does it mean to choose a random num-ber between 0 and 1? It could mean many things but if we want to specify one particular meaning, then our jobis to decide what the chance is that the random number will fall into each possible rangea ⩽ x ⩽ b: what is the chance that it lies between 0 ple? For most people, the obvious answer is 0.12 and 0.47, \text{for exam}-.35, the difference between 0 our random number lands in the interval.47 and 0.12. \text{The probability thata} ⩽ x ⩽ b will just beb - a, the length of that interval.

We have to into each subregion of the ball. The most natural choiceis to say that it is equal to the volume of that subregion divided by the volume of the entire ball, that is, the proportion of the ball occupied by the subregion. With this choice of random point, it is possible to reformulate the high-dimensional effect in the following way. Ifwe choose a subset C of the ball which has a1 chance of being hit by our random point, then the chance thatour random point lies more thanε \text{away from}2 C \text{is no}$\text{more than} 2e$-nε2/4. the geometric deviation principle as a statement about functions rather than sets.

This “directional radius” is a function on slice of the sphere on which In such a slice, the body K looks like a ball, since itsr (θ) is almost constant. radius hardly varies.The fact that K is convex means that the functionr cannot change too rapidly as we move around the sphere: if two directions are close together, then theradius of K must be about the same in these two

directions. Now we apply the geometric deviation prin-ciple to conclude that the radius of K is roughly the same on almost the entire sphere: the radius is close to its average (or median) value for all but a small frac-tion of the possible directions. That means that we have plenty of room in which to go looking for a slice onwhich the radius is almost constant—we just have to choose a slice that avoids the small bad regions. It can be shown that this happens if we choose the slice atrandom from among all possible slices. The fact that most of the sphere consists of good regions means thata random slice has a good chance of falling into a good region. about the behavior of the entire bodyjust its sections, by using the Minkowski sums defined Dvoretzky’s theorem can be recast as a statement K, rather than in the previous section. The statement is that ifconvex body inn dimensions, then there is a family of K is am K rotations+ · · · + KK1, Kis approximately a ball, where the num-2, . . . , Km of K whose Minkowski sum ber Recently, Milman and Schechtman realized that the1 mis significantly smaller than the dimensionm n. smallest numberm that would work could be described almost exactly, in terms of relatively simple proper-ties of the body K, despite the apparently enormous complexity of the choice of rotations available.For somen-dimensional convex sets, it is possible to create a ball with many fewer thann rotations. In the late 1970 s Kašin discovered that ifjust two rotations K1 and K2 are enough to produce K is the cube, then something approximating a ball, even though the cube itself is extremely far from spherical. In two dimensions it is not hard to work out which rotations are best: if we choose rotation through 45$K^{◦}1$, thento be a square and K + K is a regular octagon K2 to be its which is as close to a circle as we can get with just two squares. In higher dimensions it is extremely hard to1 2 describe which rotations to use. At present the only known method is to use randomly chosen rotations, even though the cube is as concrete and explicit an object as one ever meets in mathematics.The strongest principle discovered to date showing that most bodies behave like balls is what is usually called the reverse Brunn–Minkowski inequality. This result was proved by Milman, building on ideas of his own and of Pisier and Bourgain. The Brunn–minkowski inequality was stated earlier for sums of bodies. The reverse one has a number of different versions; the simplest is in terms of intersections. To begin with, ifis a body and B is a ball of the same volume, then the K

intersection of these two sets, the region that they havein common, is clearly of smaller volume. This obvious fact can be stated in a complicated way that looks like the Brunn–Minkowski inequality: vol(K ∩ B)1/n ⩽ vol(K)1/n. (4) intersect it with a ball of the same volume, we cap-If K is extremely long and thin, then whenever we ture only a tiny part ofof reversing inequality (4) as it stands: no possibility K. So there is no possibility of estimating the volume of K ∩ B from below. But if we are allowed to stretch the ball before intersecting itwith K, the situation changes completely. A stretched ball inn-dimensional space is called an ellipsoid (in two dimensions it is just an ellipse). The reverse Brunn–Min-kowski inequality states that for every convex body K, there is an ellipsoid E of the same volume for which vol$(K ∩ E()^{1})^{/}n ⩾ α vol(K()^{1})^{/}n$, whereαis a fixed positive number. that an apparently much stronger principle is true: thatif we are allowed to enlarge the ellipsoid by a factor of There is a widespread (but not quite universal) belief (say) 10, then we can ensure that it includes half the vol-ume of K. In other words, for every convex body, there is an ellipsoid of roughly the same size that contains half ofition about the huge variety of shapes in high dimen-$K$. Such a statement flies in the face of our intusions, but there are some good reasons to believe it. form, it is natural to ask whether the isoperimetric Since the Brunn–Minkowski inequality has a reverse inequality also does. The isoperimetric inequality guar-antees that sets cannot have a surface that is too small. Is there a sense in which bodies cannot have too largea surface area? The answer is yes, and indeed a rather precise statement can be made. Just as in the case ofthe Brunn–Minkowski inequality, we have to take into account the possibility that our body could be long and thin and so have small volume but very large surface.So we have to start by applying a linear transformation that stretches the body in certain directions (but doesnot bend the shape). For example, if we start with a triangle, we first transform it into anand then measure its surface and its volume. Once we equilateral triangle have transformed our body as best we can, it turns out that we can specify precisely which convex body hasthe largest surface for a given volume. In two dimensions it is the triangle, in three it is the tetrahedron, and inthen-dimensional convex set (called a simplex) whichn dimensions it is the natural analogue of these:

IV.26. High-Dimensional Geometry and Its Probabilistic Analogues hasn + 1 corners. The fact that this set has the largest surface was proved by the present author using an inequality from harmonic analysis discovered by Brascamp and Lieb; the fact that the simplex is the only con-vex set with maximal surface (in the sense described) was proved by Barthe.In addition to geometric deviation principles, two other methods have played a central role in the modern development of high-dimensional geometry; these methods grew out of two branches of probability theory. One is the study of sums of random points innormed spaces [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces) and how big they are, which provides important geometrical information about the spaces themselves. The other, the theory of gaussian processes, depends upon a detailed understanding of how to cover sets in high-dimensional space efficiently with small balls. This issue may sound abstruse but it addresses a fundamental problem: how to measure (or estimate) the complexity of a geometric object. Ifwe know that our object can be covered by one ball of radius 1, ten balls of radius radius 1 , and so on, then we have a good idea of how12 , fifty-seven balls of complicated the object can be.4 vealed that it is at once much more complicated thanwas previously thought and at the same time in other The modern view of high-dimensional space has reways much simpler.

When we discussed the geometric deviationεfrom the plane: the set shown shaded in principle, we estimated the volume of the set of points which were more thanε away from a set C which occu- pied half the ball. The present situation is really thesame, because each part of the shaded set consists of those points that are more thanhalf of the cube lies on the other side of the plane.ε away from whichever Arguments akin to the central limit theorem show that if we cut the cube in half with a plane, then the setof points which lie more than a distanceε from one of the halves has volume no more than e$-^{ε}^{2}$. This state- ment is different from, and apparently much weaker than, the one we obtained for the ball (3) because the factor ofimplies that if you take any plane through the centern is missing from the exponent. The estimate of the cube, then most points in the cube will be at adistance of less than 2 from it. If the plane is parallel to one of the faces of the cube, this statement certainlyis weak, because all of the cube is within distance 1 of the plane. The statement becomes significant when weconsider planes like the one in figure 11. Some points of the cube are at a distance ofplane, but still, the overwhelming majority of the cube$\sqrt{n}$ from this “diagonal” is very much closer. Thus, the estimates for the cubeand the ball contain essentially the same information; what is different is that the cube is bigger than the ball$\sqrt$ by a factor of about In the case of the ball we were able to prove a devi-n. ation estimate forjust the special sets that are cut off by planes. Towards any set occupying half the ball, not the end of the 1980 s Pisier found an elegant argument that showed that the general case works for the cube as well as for the ball. Among other things, the argu-ment uses a principle which goes back to the early days of large-deviation theory in the work of Donsker and Varadhan.

IV.26. High-Dimensional Geometry and Its Probabilistic Analogues highly developed. In principle, more or less precise The theory of large deviations in probability is now estimates are known for the probability that a sumof independent random variables deviates from its expectation by a given amount, in terms of the original distribution of the variables. In practice, the estimates involve quantities that may be difficult to compute, but there are sophisticated methods for doing this. The theory has numerous applications within probability and statistics, computer science, and statistical physics. of this theory is Talagrand’s deviation inequality for product spaces, discovered in the mid 1990 s. Tala-One of the most subtle and powerful discoveries grand himself has used this to solve several famous problems in combinatorial probability and to obtain striking estimates for certain mathematical models in particle physics. The full inequality of Talagrand is somewhat technical and is difficult to describe geomet-rically. However, the discovery had a precursor which fits perfectly into the geometric picture and which captures at least one of the most important ideas.2 We look again at random points in the cube but thistime the random point is not chosen uniformly from within the cube. As before, we choose the coordinate sx , x , . . . , x of our random point independently of one another, but we do not insist that each coordinate is chosen1 2 uniform lyn from the range between -1 and 1. For example, it might be thatues 1, 0, or-1, each with probabilityx1 can take only the val-1, that x can take only the values 1 orperhaps thatx is chosen uniformly from the entire-1 each with probabilit(y3()2()1)2, and range between-31 and 1. What matters is that the choice of each coordinate has no effect on the choice of anyothers. each coordinate determines a way of choosing a ran-dom point in the cube. This in turn gives us a way of Any sequence of rules that dictates how we choose measuring a kind of volume for subsets of the cube: the“volume” of a set A is the chance that our random point is selected frombe very different from the usual one; among other A. This way to measure volume might things, an individual point might have nonzero volume.Now suppose that C is a convex subset of the cube and that its “volume” isdom point will be selected from12 , in the sense that our ran-$C \text{with probability}1$. via an important contribution of Johnson and Schechtman.2. This precursor evolved from an original argument of Talagrand

Talagrand’s inequality says that the chance that ourrandom point will lie a distance of more thanε from C is less than 2 e^-^ε2^/16. This statement looks like the deviation estimate for the cube except that it refers onlyto convex sets C. But the crucial new information that makes the estimate and its later versions important isthat we are allowed to choose our random point in so many different ways. probability theory that have a geometric flavor. For thecube, we are able to show that if This section has described deviation estimates in C is any set occupying half the cube, then almost the entire cube is close to It would be extremely useful to know the same thing for C. convex sets more general than the cube. There are someother highly symmetric sets for which we do know it, but the most general possible statement of this typeseems to be beyond our current methods. One potential application, which comes from theoretical computer science, is to the analysis of random algorithms for vol-ume calculation. The problem may sound specialized, but it arises inalone is sufficient reason to justify the expenditure oflinear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm) (which enormous effort) and in the numerical estimation of integrals. In principle, one can calculate the volume ofa set by laying over it a very fine grid, and counting how many grid points fall into the set. In practice, if the dimension is large, the number of grid points will be so astronomically huge that no computer has a chance of performing the count.The problem of calculating the volume of a set is essentially the same as the problem of choosing a pointat random within the set, roughly as we saw in section 4. So the aim is to select a random point without identifying a huge number of possible points to select from. Atpresent, the most effective way of generating a random point in a convex set is to carry out a random walkwithin the set. We perform a sequence of small steps whose directions are chosen randomly and then select the point that we have reached after a fairly large num-ber of steps, in the hope that this point has roughly the correct chance of falling into each part of the set. Forthe method to be effective, it is essential that the random walk quickly visits points all over the set: that it does not get stuck for a long time in, say, half of the set.In order to guarantee this rapid mixing, as it is called, we need an isoperimetric principle or deviation princi-ple. We need to know that each half of our set has a large boundary, so that there is a good chance that our random walk will cross the boundary quickly and landin the other half of our set.

years, Applegate, Bubley, Dyer, Frieze, Jerrum, Kannan, Lovasz, Montenegro, Simonovits, Vempala, and others In a series of papers published over the last ten have found very efficient random walks for sampling from a convex set. A geometric deviation principle of the kind alluded to above would make it possible toestimate the efficiency of these random walks almost perfectly. 7 Conclusion The study of high-dimensional systems has become increasingly important in the last few decades. Practical problems in computing frequently lead to high-dimensional questions, many of which can be posed geometrically, while many models in particle physics are automatically high-dimensional because it is necessary to consider a huge number of particles in orderto mimic large-scale phenomena in the real world. The literature in both these fields is vast but some general remarks can be made. The intuition that we gainfrom low-dimensional geometry leads us wildly astray if we try to apply it in many dimensions. It has become clear that naturally occurring high-dimensional systems exhibit characteristics that we expect to arise in probability theory, even if the original system does not have an explicitly random element. In many cases these random characteristics are manifested as an isoperimetric or deviation principle, that is, a statement to theeffect that large sets have large boundaries. In the clas-

sical theory of probability, independence assumptions can often be used to demonstrate deviation principles quite simply. For the very much more complicated systems that are studied today it is usually useful to have a geometric picture to accompany the probabilis-tic one. That way one can understand probabilistic deviation principles as analogues of the isoperimetric prin-ciple discovered by the ancient Greeks. This article has described the relationship between geometry and probability in just a few special cases. A very much more detailed picture is almost certainly waiting to be found. At present it seems to be just out of reach.

V.1 The ABC Conjecture

The ABC conjecture, proposed by Masser and Oesterlé in 1985, is a bold and very general conjecture in number theory with a wide range of important consequences. The rough idea of the conjecture is that it is impossible for one number to be the sum of two others if all three numbers have many repeated prime factors and no twohave a prime factor in common (which would then have to be shared by the third).More precisely, one defines the radical of a positive integern, with each distinct prime included just once. Forn to be the product of all primes that divide instance, 3960= 23 \times 32 \times 5 \times 11, so its radical is$2$\times  3 \times  5 \times  11 = 330. Let us write rad(n) for the radical oftive real numbern. The ABC conjecture asserts that for every posi-there is a constant K such that ifac < K, b, andradc(abc)are coprime integers an(d1)+$. a + b = c$, then sider the Fermat equation tive integers To get a feel for the meaning of this conjecture, con-x, y , and z solve the equation, then we canxr + yr = zr. If three posi- divide through by any common factors they might haveand obtain a solution for whichx, y, and z, and hence theirr th powers, are coprime. Set a = xr , b = yr, andc = zr. Then$rad$(abc) = rad(xyz) ⩽ xyz = (abc)1^/r ⩽ c3^/r, where the last inequality follows from the fact thatis greater than botha or b. If we set to be1, thenc the ABC conjecture gives us a constant cannot be more than K(c3/r )7/6 = Kc7/2 r K. \text{Ifsuch thatr} ⩾64 thenc the power 7 can have at most finitely many solutions with/2 r is less than 1, so the Fermat equationx, y, andz coprime.It is clear that this is just one of a huge number of consequences of a similar kind. For instance, wecould deduce that there are only finitely many solutions of the equation 2 ical of 2 r 3 s x2 is at most 6 r + x3 s, which is considerably= x2, since the rad-

Thus the symbols of the two i$ξ + iη \text{and i}ξ - η$, respectively. An equation is said to bebol is zero only when$ξ = η =$0; thus, the second elliptic if its sym equation is elliptic but the first is not.

The reason for introducing the Fredholm index isthat it is a topological invariant of elliptic equations. This means that continuous variations in the coefficients of an elliptic equation leave the Fredholm index unchanged. (By contrast, the number of linearly independent solutions of an equation can vary as the coef-ficients of the equation vary.) The Fredholm index is therefore constant on each connected component ofthe set of all elliptic equations, and this raises the prospect of using topology to determine the structure of the set of all elliptic equations as an aid tocomputing the Fredholm index. This observation was made by Gelfand in the 1950 s. It lies at the root of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

V. Theorems and Problems

3 An Example

To see in more detail how topology can be used to deter-mine the Fredholm index of an elliptic equation, let us look at a specific example. Consider elliptic equations for which the coefficients mial functions ofx, with aaj(x)of degreeand b(x)m are- 1 or lesspolyno-j andb of degree m or less. The expression$i$ξ1 a1(x) + · · · + iξnan(x) + b(x)

is then a polynomial in bothx and ξ of degree m or less. Let us strengthen the hypothesis of ellipticity byassuming that the terms in this expression that have degree exactly matrix wheneverm (jointly ineither x orx andξ is nonzero. Let us alsoξ) define an invertible agree to consider only solutions adjoint that are square-integrablef , which means thatof the equation or its|f (x)|2 dx < \infty .

All these extra hypotheses are types of boundary con-ditions (the behaviors of the equation and its solutions at infinity are controlled), and collectively they imply that the Fredholm index is well-defined.A simple example is the equation d$f$ + xf = 0. (1)

The general solution to this ordinary differential equa-tion is the one-dimensional space of multiples of thed$x$ square-integrable function e$-^{x}^{2}^{/}^{2}$. By contrast, the solu- tions of the adjoint equation

$- ddfx + xf = 0$

are multiples of the function e$+x 2^{/}2$, which is not square-integrable. Thus the index of this differential equation is equal to 1. gree Returning to the general equation, the terms of de-m in i$ξ1a1(x) + · · · + iξnan(x) + b(x)$ determine a map from the unit sphere into the set GL(C) of invertible k \times  k complex matrices.(x, ξ)-space Moreover, every such map comes from an elliptic equa-$k$ tion (possibly of a more general type than we have dis-cussed up to now, but an equation to which the basic regularity theorem guaranteeing the existence of the Fredholm index applies). It therefore becomes important to determine the topological structure of the spaceof all maps from the sphere$(S^{2}()^{n})^{-1} \text{into GL} (C)$.

Given an elliptic curve [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves), there is a natural way of defining a binary operation on its points, and thisturns the elliptic curve into an abelian group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Moreover, the points on the curve with rational coordin-

ates form a subgroup of this group. Mordell’s theorem tells us that this subgroup is finitely generated. (These results are described in rational points on curves and the mordell conjecture Every finitely generated Abelian group is isomorphic[V.29](/part-05/rational-points-on-curves-and-vi40-ernst-eduard-kummer-18101893).) to a group of the form C stands for the cyclic group with Zr \times (Cn)1 \times (Cn)2 ×· · ·×n elements. The(Cn)k, where numbern r , which measures the maximum number of independent elements of this group that have infinite order, is called the rank of the elliptic curve. Mordell’s theorem implies that the rank of every elliptic curveis finite, but it does not tell us how to calculate it. That turns out to be an extraordinarily hard problem: in fact, so hard that it is considered a remarkable achievement of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer even to have come up with a plausible conjecture about it.Their conjecture relates the rank of an elliptic curve to a very different object associated with that curve: anties similar to those of the L-function [III.47](/part-03/l-functions). This is a function with proper-riemann zeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), but it is defined in terms of a series of num-bers N (E), N (E), N (E), . . . , one for each prime p$; \text{the number}2$ N^p(E)^3 is the number of points on the elliptic^5 curve when it is considered as a curve over the[I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) withp elements. One of the properties of thefield Lfact that it can be extended to a holomorphic func--function of E is that it is holomorphic[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). (The tion every where on the complex plane is very far from obvious: it follows from the fact that all elliptic curvesare modular. See fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem).) Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectured that the rank of thegroup associated with the elliptic curve is equal to the order of the zero of its L-function at 1. (If the L-function does not take the value 0 at 1, then this order is definedto be 0.) This can be thought of as a sophisticated local-to-global principle the rational solutions to the equation for the elliptic[III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory), in that it relates curve to the solutions modp for each prime p. far less was known about elliptic curves when Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer made it.

It was a truly monumental feat of prolonged collaboration, and

one of the most momentous theorems in the history ofalgebra. In order to state the classification theorem, it is necessary to describe some examples of finite sim-ple groups. The most obvious are the cyclic groups of prime order: these are clearly simple, since theyhave no subgroups at all apart from the identity and the whole group (by Lagrange’s theorem, for example, which states that the size of any subgroup is a factor ofthe size of the group). Next come the alternating groups Aeven permutations in the symmetric groupn: here Anis defined as the group consisting of all the S (see per- mutation groups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups)). \text{The alternating groupn} A \text{has example},12(n!)Aelements, \text{and is simple provided}5, \text{of order} 60, \text{is the smallest non} - Abeliann ⩾ 5. \text{Forn simple group}.\text{Next we introduce some simple groups of matrices}. \text{For an integerto be the set of alln} ⩾n$2 \text{and a field}$\times n \text{matrices with entries in} K, \text{define SLn}(K)K \text{and withgroup under matrix} \text{multiplication}, \text{called a determinant} [III.15](/part - 03/determinants) \text{equal to} 1. \text{This is aspecial linear group}. \text{For each prime power group}. \text{When the field Kis finite}, SLq, \text{there is up to isomor} - n(K)\text{is a finite phism a unique field of ordering special linear group in dimensionq}, \text{and the correspond} - n \text{is denoted by}$SL$ Zn = {(Fq\lambda I)}. These groups are not in general simple, since:$λ^{n} = 1$, the subgroup of scalar matrices in SLgroups PSLn(Fq), is a normal subgroup. However, the factor(F ) = SL (F )/Z are simple (except when(n, q)special linear= (2, n2)groups.orq (2,3 n)).

By 1980, twenty-six spo- radic groups were known.During this period the program to classify all the finite simple groups was proceeding at breakneck speed, and eventually in the early 1980 s the final classification theorem was announced. Every finite simple group is either a cyclic group of prime order, or an alternating group, or a group of Lietype, or one of the twenty-six sporadic groups. Not surprisingly, this theorem has changed the face offinite group theory and its many areas of application: one can now solve many problems in a concrete way, by reducing them to the study of the (now known) listof simple groups, rather than abstractly, by deducing them from the axioms for groups.The sheer length of the proof of the classification theorem (estimated at around ten thousand journal pages, spread across about five hundred research articles) meant that it was extremely difficult, perhaps impos-sible, for a single person to work through the entire

proof. It also meant that the chances were rather highthat there were errors along the way. Fortunately, in the years since the announcement of the result, various teams of group theorists have been publishing summaries and revisions of many parts of the proof, anda series of volumes containing the whole proof is now well on the way to completion. V.8 Dirichlet’s Theorem A famous theorem of euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) asserts that there are infinitely many primes. But what if one wantsmore information about these primes? For instance, are there infinitely many primes of the form 4 n -1? A fairly straightforward modification of Euclid’s argu-ment shows that there are, and a slightly more difficult modification proves that there are infinitely manyof the form 4$n +$1 as well. However, modifications of Euclid’s argument are not enough to prove the general result in this direction, which is that ifcoprime (that is, have highest common factor 1), thena and m are there are infinitely many primes of the formmn +aare now called Dirichlet. This was proved by dirichlet L-functions[VI.36] using what[III.47](/part-03/l-functions), which are closely related to the[IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory). The condition th atm riemann zeta function and a have highest com- mon factor 1 is clearly necessary, since any common factor ofm and a will be a factor of mn + a.

This result statespoincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912), that if Xis a set of finite volume, as above, and A is a subset ofpoints of Areturn infinitely often to Xwith nonzero volume, then “almost all$A$.” In other words, if we set  ̃Tnx \in  A Afor infinitely manyto be the set of all pointsn, then the measure of thex \in  A such that set of points in$A$but not in  ̃A is 0. The main step in the proof of Poincaré’s theorem is to prove the sameabout the set A , which consists of all points x \in  A such thatwhy this is true, let Tnx \in1 A for B be the set of all points insome positive integer n. To see A but not inmeasure, since$A^{1}$. The sets T is volume preserving. (B, T^-1 B, T^-2 B, . . . all have the same T^-n Bis defined to be the set of allx such that Tnx \in  B.) Since X has finite volume, there must exist positive integersn such that the intersection of T-m B and (T-)(mm+andn)B has positive measure, and from this it follows that the measure of B ∩ T-n B is also positive. But if x \in  B thenx \in  A1, so Tnx \in  A and therefore Tnx \in  B, so this is a contradiction.Now let us apply the von Neumann ergodic theorem with(that is, f equal to the characteristic function of a setf (x) = 1 when x \in  A and f (x) = 0 otherwise)A andthe set Udefined in terms of X has volume 1 and write T as before.

The Fermat–Euler Theorem See modular arithmetic [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic) V.10 Fermat’s Last Theorem Many people, even if they are not mathematicians, are aware of the existence oftriples of positive integers(x, y, z)Pythagorean triples such that x$: \text{that is}$,2+y2 =z2. These give us examples of right-angled triangles with integer side lengths, of which the best known is the “we have that(3, 4, 5) (mtriangle.” For any two integers2$-n2)2+(2mn)2 = (m2 + n2m)2$, whichand n, gives us an infinite supply of Pythagorean triples, andin fact every Pythagorean triple is a multiple of a triple of this form.fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665) asked the very natural question of whether similar triples existed for higher powers: thatis, could there be a solution in positive integers of the equationxn + yn = zn for some power n ⩾3? For instance, is it possible to express a cube as a sum of two other cubes? Or rather, Fermat famously claimed that it was not possible, and that he had a proof that space did not permit him to write down. Over the nextthree and a half centuries, this problem became the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics. Giventhe amount of effort that went into it, one can be virtually certain that Fermat did not in fact have a proof: the problem appears to be irreducibly difficult, and solvable only by techniques that were developed much laterthan Fermat.

The fact that Fermat’s question was an easy one to think of does not on its own guarantee that it is inter-esting. Indeed, in 1816 gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) wrote in a letter that he found it too isolated a problem to interest him.At the time, that was a reasonable remark: it is often extremely hard to determine whether a given Diophan-tine equation has a solution, and it is therefore easy to come up with hard problems of a similar nature to Fer-mat’s last theorem. However, Fermat’s last theorem has turned out to be exceptional in ways that even Gauss could not have been expected to foresee, and nobody would now describe it as “isolated.” solved for By the time of Gauss’s remark, the problem had beenn = 3 (by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783)) and n = 4 (by Fer- mat; this is the easiest case). The first serious connec-tion between Fermat’s last theorem and more general mathematical concerns came with the work ofmer [VI.40] in the middle of the nineteenth century. ankum important observation that had been made by Euler isthat it can be fruitful to study Fermat’s last theorem in larger chosen, allow one to factorize the polynomial rings [III.81 §1](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules), \text{since these}, \text{if appropriate lyzn} - yn. Indeed, \text{if we write} 1, ζ, ζ2, . . . , ζn - 1 \text{for the nth roots} of 1, \text{then we can factorize it as} (z - y)(z - ζy)(z - ζ2 y) · · · (z - ζn - 1 y). (1) Therefore, ifdifferent - looking \text{factorizations} ofxn + yn = \text{zn then we have two ratherxn inside the ring} \text{generated by} 1 andabove, andxxx · · · xζ), \text{and it is reasonable to hope that}(\text{namely the factorization in} (1) \text{this information might be exploited}. However, \text{thereis a serious problem}: \text{the ring generated by} 1 andζ \text{does not enjoy the} [[IV.1 §§4–8]](/part - 04/algebraic - numbers), \text{so one}’s \text{sense of being close to a contra}-\text{unique factorization property diction when faced with these two} \text{factorizations} \text{is notwell} - founded. Kummer, \text{in connection with the search forculty and had defined the notion of anhigher reciprocity laws} [V.28](/part - 05/from - quadratic - reciprocity - to - vi38 - augustus - de - morgan - 18061871), had met this diffi-ideal [III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules): very roughly, if you enlarge a ring by adding in Kum-mer’s “ideal numbers,” then unique factorization is restored. Using these concepts, Kummer was able toprove Fermat’s last theorem for every prime number p that was not a factor of thethe corresponding ring. He called such primes class number [IV.1 §7](/part-04/number-theory) ofregular. This connected Fermat’s last theorem with ideas thathave belonged to the mainstream of algebraic number theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) ever since. However, it did not solve the problem, since there are infinitely many irregular primes (though this was not known in Kummer’s day).

V. Theorems and Problems

used for individual irregular primes, and eventually an It turned out that more complicated ideas could be algorithm was developed that could check for any given$n$ whether Fermat’s last theorem was true for thatn. By the late twentieth century, the theorem had been verified for all exponents up to 4 000 000. However, a general proof came from a very different direction.The story of the eventual proof by Andrew Wiles has been told many times, so we shall be very brief about it here. Wiles did not study Fermat’s last theorem directly, but instead solved an important special case of the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture, which connects[III.59](/part-03/modular-forms). \text{The first hint that elliptic curves might be rel}-\text{elliptic curves} [III.21](/part - 03/elliptic - curves) \text{and modular forms evant came when Yves Hellegouarch noticed that the elliptic curvey}2 = x(x - ap )(x - bp ) \text{would have} \text{rather unusual properties if} ap + bp \text{was also a pth} power. \text{Gerhard Frey realized that such a curve mightbe so unusual that it would contradict the Shimura Taniyama}–\text{Weil conjecture}. Jean-\text{Pierre Serre came up with a precise statement} (the “\text{epsilon conjecture}”) \text{thatwould imply this}, \text{and Ken Ribet proved Serre}’s conjecture, \text{thus establishing that Fermat}’s \text{last theorem was a consequence of the Shimura}–Taniyama–\text{Weil conjecture}. \text{Wiles suddenly became very interested indeed}, \text{and after seven years of intensive and almost secret work he announced a solution to a case of the Shimura}–Taniyama–\text{Weil conjecture that was sufficient to prove Fermat}’s \text{last theorem}. \text{It then emerged that Wiles}’\text{sproof contained a serious mistake}, \text{but with the help of Richard Taylor he managed to find an alternative and correct argument for that portion of the proof}.\text{The Shimura}–Taniyama–\text{Weil conjecture asserts that} “\text{all elliptic curves are modular}.” \text{We finish by giving a rough idea of what this means}.

Modular forms are periodicity properties defined on the upper half-plane; holomorphic functions n[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) with certain associated with each modular form series [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) that takes the formf \text{is a fourierf} (q) = a1(f )q + a2(f )q2 + a3(f )q3 + · · · .

For instance, if E is the ellip- tic curve$y^{2} + y = x^{3} - x^{2} - 10x - 20$, \text{then there is} \text{a modular formprimep apart from} 11. This modular form is the uniquef such that ap(E) = ap (f ) for every complex function (up to scaling) that satisfies a certain periodicity property with respect to the groupΓ (11), which consists of all matrices$(^{a} b^{c} d ) \text{such that a}^{0}$, b, c, andd are integers,[III.15](/part-03/determinants) ad-cbcis a multiple of 11, and theis 1. It is far from obvious that adeter- minant definition of this type should have anything to do with elliptic curves.Wiles proved that all “semistable” elliptic curves are modular, not by showing how to associate a modular form with each such elliptic curve, but by using a subtle counting argument that guaranteed that the modu-lar form had to exist. The full conjecture was proved a few years later, by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor, which put the icing on the cake of one of the most celebrated mathematical achievements of all time. V.11 Fixed Point Theorems 1 Introduction The following is a variant of a well-known mathematical puzzle. A man is on a train from London to cambridge and has a bottle of water with him. Prove that there is at least one moment on the journey when the volume ofair in the bottle, as a fraction of the volume of the bottle itself, is exactly equal to the fraction of his journey thathe has completed. (For instance, the bottle might be two fifths full, and therefore three fifths empty, at the precise moment when he is three fifths of the way from London to Cambridge. Note that we do not assume thatthe bottle is full at the start of the journey or empty at the end.)The solution, if you have not seen this sort of question before, is surprisingly simple. For each0 and 1 letf (x) be the proportion of air in the bottlex between when the proportion of the journey that has been com-pleted isx. Then 0 ⩽ f (x) ⩽ 1 for every x, since the volume of air in the bottle cannot be negative and can-not exceed the volume of the bottle. If we now setg(x) to bex -f (x), \text{then we see that} g(0) ⩽ 0 and g(1) ⩾ 0. \text{Sincesome moment at whichg}(x) \text{varies continuously withg}(x) = 0, \text{so thatx}, \text{there must bef} (x) = x, \text{which is what we wanted}. 693 \text{of one of the simplest of all fixed point theorems}. \text{Wecould state it more formally as follows}: \text{if What we have just proved is a slightly disguised formf is a contin}- \text{uous function from the closed interval then there must exist anx such that} f (x)[0,=1]\text{xto itself},.

Let D = B2 \text{be the closed unit disk}. \text{If we had a continuous function fixed point}, \text{then we could define a continuous functionf from} D to D \text{with nogfollow a straight path fromfrom} D \text{to its boundary} \partial Df (x)\text{as follows}: \text{for eachtox and continue onx}, 694 f (x) x g(x) D Figure 1 \text{can be used to define a retraction Iffhas no fixed points}, \text{then itg}. \text{in a straight line}$;\partial D$(\text{see figure} 1), and it is well-defined because (andg(x)is the point where you first reach only because)f (x) = x. If x is already on the boundary ofg: DD, then\to  \partial Dg(x)such that= x. So we have a continuous functiong(x) = x for every x \in  \partial D. Such a function is called a retraction from D to \partial D. fromnot, then we will have contradicted the assumption that It seems highly unlikely that a continuous retraction D to \partial D could exist. If we can prove that it can- there is a continuous function from D to Dwith no fixed point, and thereby have proved Brouwer’s fixed point theorem in two dimensions. retractions from disks to their boundaries cannot exist.There are several ways of proving that continuous Here we briefly sketch two.Suppose, first, thatg is such a retraction. For eachtradius, let us consider the restriction oft about the origin, and let us represent a typ-g to the circle of ical point in this circle as t(ei)θ. Let us write g (θ) fortg(tθ goes from 0 to 2(ei)θ). When t = 1 the circle of radiusπ, g (θ) = e^i^θ goes once aroundt is ∂D, so ast

the unit circle. Whent = 0, the circle of radius t is a single point, so asθ \text{goes from} 0 to 2π, g (θ) ist

just the constant pointthe unit circle at all. Therefore, somewhere between$g(0)$, which does not go aroundt = 1 and t = 0 there must be a change in the number$\text{of timesfrom} 0 to 2$ gt (θ)π. But the functions goes around the unit circle asgt are a continuouslyθ goes varying family of functions, and a small change in$gt$

cannot cause a sudden jump in the number of timesthatgt(θ) goes around the circle. (To make this last step rigorous needs a bit of work, but the basic ideais sound.) A second proof uses basic tools from algebraic topology. The firstis trivial, since every curve in the disk can be shrunk homology group [IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of the disk$D$

If there is a continuous retraction g from D to∂Dg: , then we can find continuous maps D \to  ∂D such that g ◦ h is the identity onh:∂D \to ∂DD. (Weand letwe leth be the map that takes a point ofg be the continuous retraction.) Now continuous∂D to itself and maps between topological spaces give rise tomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) between their homology groups, homoin such a way that compositions go to compositions and identity maps go to identity maps. (That is, there is a functor spaces and continuous maps to the category of groups[III.8](/part-03/categories) from the category [III.8](/part-03/categories) of topological and group homomorphisms.) This means that theremust be homomorphismsφ: Z$→ {0} and ψ$:${0} → Z$ such thatψ ◦ φ is the identity on Z, which is obviously impossible.Both proofs generalize to higher dimensions: the second straightforward ly (once one knows how to compute homology groups of spheres), \text{and the first via thenotion of the degree of a continuous map from then}- \text{sphere to itself}, \text{which is a higher}-\text{dimensional analogueof the notion of the number of times a map from the circle to itself} “\text{goes around the circle}.” tions. \text{For example}, \text{the following fact is important inthe theory of random walks on graphs}.

the theorem says that there must be some$x \in f (x)$. Brouwer’s theorem is the special case wherex such that eachf (x) is a set with just one element. 3 A Stronger Form of Brouwer’s

Fixed Point Theorem

So far, we have discussed maps from solid spheres to themselves, but there is nothing to stop us thinking about whether continuous maps on other spaces must have fixed points. For example, let S2 \text{be the} (nonsolid) spherea continuous function from$\\{(x}$, y, z)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}$: x2 + y2 + S2zto2 = S21$. Must and letf have af be fixed point? At first one might think so: some obvi-ous functions from S2 to itself are rotations and reflections, both of which certainly have fixed points, and it ishard to see how one can “get rid” of those fixed points. However, eventually one realizes that there is a simple example of a function without a fixed point, namely the function$f (x) = −x$, which reflects each point through the origin. that the result we had hoped for is false and to turnour attention to something else. But this reaction is The obvious reaction to this example is to note a mistake, as it is in many other mathematical con-texts, because there was something importantly correct about the idea that it was impossible to get rid of thefixed points of a rotation. It turns out that if you start with a rotation and try to get rid of the fixed pointsby continuously deforming it, then you are doomed to failure. In fact, in a certain sense there will always be exactly two fixed points. More generally, if you takeany continuous function from$S^{2} to S^{2} \text{and continu}-$ ously deform it, then you cannot change the number offixed points. false if taken at face value so some re interpretation Of course, these last two statements are patently is needed. First, we must assume that the number offixed points is finite, but this is not a huge assumption as it can be shown that a typical small perturbation ofany continuous function will have only finitely many fixed points. Second, we must count the fixed points with appropriate weights. To define these, suppose that f (x) = x, and imagine a point y(t) that goes aroun dx index in a tiny circle asof the fixed pointtgoes from 0 to 1. We define thex to be the number of turns made by the vector from negatively if these turns are in the opposite directiony(t) to f (y(t)), counting this to the way that problematic iff (y(t))y(t) \text{goes around} = y(t) \text{for somex}. (This definition ist, but again

we can make small perturbations and assume that thisdoes not happen.) Then the sum of the indices of all the fixed points is the quantity that does not change if you continuously deform It follows that if you continuously deform a rotation, f . then the sum of the indices will always be 2. From thisit follows that there must be at least one fixed point. It also follows that you cannot continuously deform a rotation so that it becomes the map that sends eachto-x. x alized in a fairly straightforward way to higher dimen-The notion of the index of a fixed point can be gener sions (using the concept of degree mentioned earlier), and one can show under very general circumstances that the sum of the indices of fixed points remains constant when you continuously deform a continuous map. This implies Brouwer’s fixed point theorem as fol-lows. We can continuously deform any continuous map $f$: Bn \to  Bn into any other continuous map g:$B^{n} \to B^{n}$ by definingf (x) = (1 - t)f (x) + tg(x) and letting tt map vary from 0 to 1. Let us therefore takex \to 1 x, which has a single fixed point. This fixedg to be the point has index 1 (as one can see easily in the two-2 dimensional case), and therefore the sum of the indicesof the fixed points of$f is 1 \text{as well}$. points of a function In general, the sum of the indices of the fixed$f$defined on a suitable topological space[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) can be calculated in terms of the effect of X (such as a smooth compact manifoldf on the homology groups ofis (a slight generalization of) the X . The resulting theorem Lefschetz fixed point theorem. invariant of continuous deformations can be used togive a proof of The fact that the index of a continuous map is anthe fundamental theorem of algebra ing that the polynomial[V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra).

If we write the left-hand side as L(u), then this equation can be further rewritten as $u = L^{-1}(10 sin(u^{2}) + 10 exp(−|x|))$. (It is possible to identify the operator$L^{-1} explicitly$.) If we now lettions defined on X be the Banach space of continuous func-R that tend to 0 at ±$\i\text{nf ty}$, with the uni- form norm, then it can be shown that the right-handside of this last equation defines a continuous function fromby the Schauder fixed point theorem, this highly non-X to a compact convex subset of X. Therefore, linear equation has a solution with the given bound-ary conditions, a result that is hard to prove in any other way. V.12 The Four-Color Theorem

Bojan Mohar

The four-color theorem asserts that the regions of anymap drawn in the plane (or, equivalently, on the two dimensional sphere) can be colored with no more thanfour colors in such a way that any two regions with a common boundary are given different colors. The example in figure 1 shows that four distinct colors are necessary since the regions A, B, C, and D are all adja-cent to each other. This result was conjectured by Francis Guthrie in 1852. An incorrect proof was given by Kempe in 1879, and for eleven years the problem was believed to have been solved, until Heawood pointed out the error in 1890. However, Heawood showed that Kempe’s basic idea, which we shall outline below, could at least be used to give a correct proof that five colors were always sufficient. After that, the problem became a famous example of a question that remained stub-bornly open despite being very easy to understand.

First, every planar graph must containa configuration X that belongs to C. Second, given a planar graph Gthat contains a configuration X from C, and given a proper coloring of the rest of G that uses at most four colors, it is possible to adjust this coloring insuch a way that it can be extended to a proper coloring of the whole of G. In the proof of the five-color theorem above, there was a very simple list of five configura-tions: a vertexv with one edge, two edges, three edges, four edges, or five edges coming out of it. Nothing this simple works for the four-color problem, but Heesch’s

698

idea was that it might be possible to solve the problemby using a more complicated list of configurations. Such a list was found by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in 1976. However, this is by no means thewhole story, because the list of configurations that they found was not just “more complicated” but so muchmore complicated that it broke new ground: it was the first time that a major theorem had been proved with a proof that was too long to be humanly checkable. Thereason for this was partly that their list C contained about 1200 configurations, but a more important rea-son was that for some configurations X it was neces- sary to check hundreds of thousands of cases in order to demonstrate that a coloring of the rest of the graph could be adjusted to accommodate a coloring of X as well. Therefore, there was no alternative but to use acomputer to do the checking. (Heesch had himself proposed a list, but some of his configurations would have involved so many cases that even a computer could nothave checked them all.) Appel and Haken was mixed. Some hailed it as the addi-tion of a powerful new tool to the mathematical armory.The reaction of other mathematicians to the proof of Others were uneasy about having to trust that the rele-vant computer program had been written correctly and that the computer had operated as it should. And infact the proof turned out to have several flaws, though all those that were discovered were subsequently corrected by Appel and Haken in their monograph of1989. Any doubts there may have been of this kind were removed once and for all in 1997, when Robert-son, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas developed another proof based on similar principles. The part of the proof that was checkable by humans was made more trans-parent, and the computer-verified part was supported by a well-structured collection of data that enabled theproofs to be checked independently. One could still question whether the compilers used were correct and whether the hardware was stable, but the proof hasbeen checked on different platforms, using different programming languages and operating systems, so thisproof is much less likely to be incorrect than a typical human-checked proof of even moderate length. worried about whether the proof is correct.

As a result, ifsomeone were to discover a shorter and more accessible proof it would be regarded by many as a break-through comparable to the solution of the problem by Appel and Haken. An unfortunate side effect of this isthat mathematics departments around the world still receive many incorrect attempted proofs, several ofwhich repeat the mistake of Kempe. provoked the development of many important new Like many good problems, the four-color problem mathematical ideas. The theory of graph colorings, in particular, has evolved into a deep and beautiful area of research. (Seetorics [IV.19 §2.1.1](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics) and also Jensen and Toft (1995).)extremal and probabilistic combina Extensions of map-coloring problems to arbitrary surfaces led to the development of topological graph theory, and questions about the planarity of graphs culminated in the theory of One of the most prolific graph theorists, william graph minors [V.32](/part-05/the-robertsonseymour-theorem).

It is this that makes themseem not an artificial construction but a wonderful discovery.For many polynomials it is not hard to see that they have roots. For example, if$P (x) = x^{d} - u \text{for some pos}-$ itive integer root of P will be ad and some complex numberdth root of u. One can writeu, then au in the form$r (e^{i})^{θ}$, and then (r1)/d(ei)θ/d will be such a root. This means that any polynomial that can be solved by aformula involving dth roots and the usual arithmetical operations, which includes all polynomials of degree less than 5, can be solved in the complex number system.

Later he went on to give three more proofs. V.14 The Fundamental Theorem of

Arithmetic

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is the assertion that every positive integer can be expressed in exactly one way as a product of prime numbers. These prime numbers are known as the prime factors of the original number and the product itself is the tor ization. To give a few examples: 12= \text{prime fac} - 2 \times 2 \times 3, 343= 7 \times  7 \times  7, 4559 = 47 \times  97, and 7187 is itself a prime. This last number shows that the word “product”should be interpreted so as to include the case where there is only one prime involved. As for the phrase“exactly one way,” it is understood that the order in which the primes are multiplied is not significant, so, for example, the products 47\times  97 and 97 \times  47 are not regarded as different.The following inductive procedure allows one to find the prime factorization of a given positive integern is prime, then we have found it already. Otherwise, n. If$let$ p be the smallest prime factor of n and let m = n/p. Sincem is smaller than n, we know by induction how

700

to find the prime factorization ofwithp, gives it to us for n. In practice, what this meansm, and this, together is that we generate a sequence of numbers, where each number in the sequence is the previous one divided by its smallest prime factor. For example, if we start withthe number 168, then the sequence begins 168, 84, 42,

21. At this point we cannot divide by 2, but 3 is a factorof 21 so the next number in the sequence is 7. Since 7 is a prime, the process stops. Looking back, we find thatwe have shown that 168$= 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7$. inconceivable that a number could have two genuinely different prime factorizations. But the method does not Once one is used to this method, it comes to seem guarantee this at all. Suppose we successively divideby the largest prime factor rather than the smallest. Why should this not give a completely different set of primes? It is hard to think of an argument that doesnot use a phrase such as “the prime factorization of$n$,” thereby implicitly assuming what it sets out to prove.It is possible to show in a rather precise way that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic isby looking at an algebraic structure where the notionnot obvious, of prime factorization makes sense but numbers can have more than one prime factorization. This structure, denoted Z$(\sqrt{-5})$, is the set of all numbers of the formacan be added and multiplied just like ordinary integers$.+ b\sqrt{-5}$, where a and b are integers. Such numbers For example, $(1 + 3 \sqrt{-5}) + (6 - 7 \sqrt{-5}) = 7 - 4 \sqrt{-5}$ and (1 + 3\sqrt{-5})(6 -\sqrt{7}\sqrt{-5}) \sqrt \sqrt= 6 - 7 \sqrt{-5} + 18 -5 - 21( -5)2= 6 + 11 -\sqrt{5} + 21 \times  5= 111 + 11 -5.bwould also be a natural definition if we wanted to\sqrt{In} this structure, we can regard a number-5 as prime if its only factors are ±1 and ±xx=. (Thisa + extend the notion of primes from the positive integersto all integers.) It can be shown quite easily that 2 and 3 are both primes (though it is not immediately obvious since there are now more possibilities for factors). \text{Two other primes are} 1 \text{either as} 2 \times 3 \text{or as}+\sqrt(-1 5 and 1+ \sqrt{-5})(-\sqrt{1} --5. \text{But we can write} 6\sqrt{-5})$, so 6 \text{has two}$\text{different prime} \text{factorizations}. \text{For a further discussion of this point see algebraic numbers} [[IV.1 §§4–8]](/part - 04/algebraic - numbers). damental theorem of arithmetic must use some featureof What this example shows is that any proof of the fun-Z, the set of integers, that is lacking in Z(\sqrt{-5}). Since

V. Theorems and Problems

addition and multiplication work in a very similar wayin both structures, it is not very easy to find such a feature, or at least not one that is relevant. It turns outthat the important property that Z(\sqrt{-5}) \text{does not have} is an appropriate analogue of the following basic principle for integers: that ifone can writen = qm + r mwith 0 and n⩽ r <are integers, then|m|. This fact underlies important role in the most commonly given proof ofeuclid’s algorithm [III.22], which plays an unique factorization.

Cameron In response to problems in the foundations of mathematics such asall sets which are not members of themselves; is it a Russell’s paradox (“consider the set of member of itself?”), hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) proposed that the consistency of any given part of mathematics shouldbe established by finitary methods that could not lead to a contradiction. Any part for which this had been done could then be used as a secure foundation for allof mathematics. metic of the natural numbers, which can be described interms of An example of a “part of mathematics” is the arith-first-order logic [IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory). We begin with symbols, both logical (connectives such as “not” and“implies,” quantifiers such as “for all,” the equality symbol, symbols for variables, and punctuation) and nonlogical (symbols for constants, relations, and functions suitable for the branch of mathematics under consider at i on). Formulas are finite strings of symbols built according to certain precise rules (which allow themto be mechanically recognized). We fix a certain set of formulas as ourrules of inference that allow us to infer some formulas axioms, and we also choose a few from others. An example of a rule of inference isponens: if we have inferred$φ and (φ \to ψ)$, then we canmodus inferψ. A theorem is a formula that is at the end of a chain (or tree) of inferences that starts with axioms.

The nonlogi-speano, addi- tion, and multiplication. (The last two can be defined interms of the others by inductive axioms: for example, the rules$x$ + 0 = x and x + s(y) = s(x + y)define addition.) The crucial axiom is thetion, which asserts that if P (n) is a formula such that principle of induc-P (0) is true and P (n) implies P (s(n)) for all n, then P (n)to give a formal proof of the consistency of this theory: is true for all$n$. Hilbert’s specific challenge was that is, a proof that no contradiction can be deduced from the axioms by the rules of first-order logic. Hilbert’s program was undone by two remarkable incompleteness theorems first theorem states the following.proved by gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978). The There are (first-order) statements about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from Peano’s axioms. (This is sometimes qualified by being prefixed with, “If Peano’s axioms are consistent, thensince we accept the existence of the natural numbers,. . ..” However, we do know that Peano’s axioms are consistent, asthe natural numbers model them. So the qualification is unnecessary here, although it would need to be included if we were discussing some axioms whose consistency was not clear.) ideas. The first isof encoding each formula or sequence of formulas as a Gödel’s proof is long, but it is based on two simple Gödel numbering, which is a means natural number in a systematic and mechanical way. π(x, y)proof of It can be shown that there is a two-variable formula such thatm,” which is a shorthand way of saying thatπ(m, n)holds if and only if “n is am Gödel number of a string of formulas that constitutes ais the Gödel number of a formulaφ and n is the proof ofω(x, y)φsuch that. Slightly more elaborately, there is a formulaω(m, n) holds if and only if m is the Gödel number of a formula and$n$is the Gödel number of a proof ofφ that has one free variableφ(m). (A free variable is one that is not quantified over. For example,φ(x) might be the formula (∃y)y2 = x, in which casexnwould be the Gödel number of a proof that the Gödelis the free variable. For this choice ofφ, the number number of Now letψ(x)φ was a perfect square.)be the formula (∀y)(¬ω(x, y)). If φ is a formula (with one free variable) with Gödel numberm, then ψ(m) tells us that there is no proof of φ(m). (It tells us this indirectly: what it actually says is that

there is no Let pbe the Gödel number of$y$that is the Gödel number of such a proof.)ψ itself, and let ζ be the formulaψ(p). reference asserts its own unprovability, since This brings us to the second idea in the proof:. The formulaζ is carefully devised so that itψ(p) tells us thatself- there is no proof of the formula formula with Gödel numberp. In other words, it tells usφ(p), where φ is the that there is no proof ofψ(p). Since ζ asserts its own unprovability, it must be unprovable (since a proof ofwould be a proof thatζ had no proof, which is absurd).ζ Sinceis true, and since it is true it cannot be disprovable.ζ asserts its unprovability and is unprovable, it (One might wonder why this argument thatζ is true does not constitute a proof ofalthough it is a rigorous demonstration of the truth ofζ. The answer is thatζnot an argument that starts from the Peano axioms and, it is not a proof in Peano arithmetic. That is, it is uses the rules of inference of the kind we discussed earlier.) consistency of the axioms as a first-order formula: namely Gödel numbering also allowed Gödel to consider the(∀y)(¬(π(m, y))), where mis the Gödel number of the formula 0= s(0) (\text{or any other contradiction}). Here is Gödel’s second theorem. It is impossible to prove from Peano’s axioms that theyare consistent. the Peano axioms, but apply to any (consistent) sys-tem of mechanically recognizable axioms that is pow-The proofs of these theorems are not specific to erful enough to describe the natural numbers. Thus, completeness cannot be restored simply by adding a true but unprovable statement as a new axiom, forthe resulting system is still strong enough for Gödel’s theorem to apply to it.It might seem that we could obtain a complete axiomatization of the natural numbers by simply taking alltrue statements as axioms. However, one requirement for Gödel’s theorems is that the axioms should be rec-ognizable by some mechanical method. (This is needed to construct the formulaπ(x, y) at the start of the proof.) Indeed, we can deduce from this that (as subse-quently pointed out by turing [VI.94](/part-06/alan-turing-19121954)) the true statements about the natural numbers ically recognized (that is, their Gödel numbers do notcannot be mechanform a Gödel’s true but unprovable statement is impor-recursive set ). tant for the foundations of mathematics, but it hasno intrinsic interest in its own right. Later, Paris and

702

Harrington gave the first example of a mathematically significant statement that is unprovable from Peano’s axioms. Their statement is a variant oforem [IV.19 §2.2](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics). Subsequently, many other “natural ramsey’s the incompleteness es” have been found. Of course, the consistency of Peano’s axioms can be proved in a stronger system, since we could just add the(unprovable) consistency statement. Less trivially, since a model of the natural numbers can be constructed within set theory, the consistency of Peano arithmetic can be proved from[IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) (known as ZFC) for set theory. Of course, the zermelo–fraenkel axioms ZFC cannot prove its own consistency, but the consistency of ZFC can be deduced from a yet stronger sys-tem (for example, adding an axiom that asserts the existence of a suitably “large” cardinal number such as an inaccessible cardinal [IV.22 §6](/part-04/set-theory)). times possible to find complete axiom systems (that For small enough parts of mathematics, it is someis, systems that allow one to prove every true state-ment). For instance, this can be done for the theory of the natural numbers with zero, the successor function, and addition alone. Thus, multiplication is essential to Gödel’s argument. not It is more elementary to see that Peano’s axioms are categorical: there are models for the axioms that are not isomorphic to the natural numbers. such standard models of arithmetic contain infinitely large non numbers (that is, numbers that are larger than all natural numbers). phers arguing about whether the human brain is a Gödel’s theorem has been a battleground for philoso deterministic machine (in which case, presumably, wewould not be able to prove any formally unprovable statement).

Given any two such matrices X and Yhand corner, and the “error matrix”, the products XY and Y Xdiffer only in the top right-XY -Y X commutes with everything in the group.

formulate CH. He tried hard to prove or disprove it, asdid many others after him, but nobody succeeded. Gradually, mathematicians came to entertain the idea that CH might be “independent” of normal mathe-matics: that is, independent of the usual zfc axioms [IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) of set theory. This would mean that it couldbe neither proved nor disproved from the ZFC axioms. The first result in this direction was due to gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978), who showed that CH could not befrom the usual axioms. In other words, one could not disproved reach a contradiction by assuming CH. To do this, he showed that inside every model of set theory [IV.22 §3.2](/part-04/set-theory) there is a model in which CH holds. This model is called the “constructible universe.” roughly speaking, it consists just of those sets that “have to exist” if the axioms are true. So, in this model, the setof reals is as small as it could possibly be. The “smallest uncountable size” is usually denoted construction the reals appear inא אstages, \text{with only}1, and in Gödel’s countably many reals appearing at each stage. Fromthis one can deduce that the number of reals is1א , which is precisely the assertion of CH.The other direction had to wait thirty years, until Paul Cohen invented the method ofmake CH false? Starting from some model of set theory forcing. How would we (in which CH might well hold), we would like to “add”some reals to it. Indeed, we would like to add enough that there are now more thanא1 of them. But how do we “add” a real? We need to ensure that what we end upwith is still a model of set theory, which is hard enough, but also that when we add new reals we do not alter thevalue ofא(since otherwise the statement “the number of reals is1א1” may still be true in the new model). This is an extremely complicated task, both conceptu-ally and technically. See set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) for more details about how it is carried out.

What does it mean to understand a certain area of math-ematics completely? One possible answer is that you understand it when you can solve its problems ically. Consider, for instance, the following question.mechan-

V. Theorems and Problems

Jim is half the age of his mother, and in twelve years’time he will be three-fifths of her age. How old is his mother now? For a child who is just old enough to understand the concept of “three-fifths,” this is likely to be an impossibly difficult problem. A bright and slightly older child may be able to solve it after some hard thought, which will probably include a certain amountof trial and error. But for anybody who has learned how to translate such problems into equations and who knows how to solve two simultaneous linear equations, the problem is utterly routine: let xbe Jim’s age and$y$ his mother’s; then the problem tells us that 2 and 5$(x + 12) = 3(y + 12)$; the second equation can be$x = y$ rearranged to give 3 gives$x = 24$, so y = y48.- 5 x =$24$; substituting$y = 2x$ that problems that once seemed to be difficult and torequire ingenuity have become routine in this sort of The more mathematics one learns, the more one finds way, and it is eventually tempting to ask whether all of mathematics might, ultimately, be reducible to amechanical procedure. And even if you think that that is a bit much to hope for, you can still ask the ques-tion about certain natural classes of problems, such as simultaneous linear equations. Perhaps there is always a mechanical procedure for solving the problems inany sufficiently “natural” class, even if there is not necessarily a systematic way of finding the mechanical procedure. One class of problems that has been intensively studied for several centuries is that oftions, which are equations in one or more variables Diophantine equawhere one stipulates that the solutions should be inte-gers. The most famous Diophantine equation is the Fermat equation$x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n}$, but this is somewhat com- plicated because one of the variables, exponent.

to a systematic solution of all polynomial equations ofdegree up to 2 in two variables. By the end of the nineteenth century, these and many other Diophantine equations had been com-pletely solved, but there was no single overarching method that dealt with all of them. This state of affairs prompted hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) to include, as the tenth in his famous list of twenty-three unsolved problems, the question of whether there was a single, universal pro-cedure for solving all polynomial Diophantine equations in any number of variables. Later, in 1928, heasked the more general question alluded to earlier: is there a universal procedure for determining the truthor falsity of any mathematical statement? This question became known as themeans “decision problem” in German).entscheidungspr oblem (which to both questions would be yes. In other words, he Hilbert expected, or at least hoped, that the answers hoped that the mathematicians of his day were in the position of the child who has not yet learned how to solve simultaneous equations. Perhaps a new age was dawning in which it would be possible, at least in principle, to solve all mathematical problems systematically and without relying on native wit. strong: although problems of some kinds could be The evidence in favor of such a view was not very solved fully systematically, others, including Diophan-tine equations, stubbornly resisted, and the role of ingenuity in mathematical research appeared to be asimportant as ever. But if one wanted to give a negative answer to Hilbert’s questions, then one faced a major challenge: in order to prove rigorously that there isno systematic procedure for accomplishing a particular task, one has to be absolutely clear about what a“systematic procedure” actually is. Nowadays there is an easy answer to this: a systematic procedure is anything that you can programa computer to do. (Strictly speaking, this is an over simplification, because one also makes the idealizing assumption that the computer has unlimited storage space.) Our feeling that we do not have to think too hard to solve simultaneous equations is reflected in the factthat we can devise a computer program to do it for us (though if we want the program to be fast and numer-ically robust, we will face very interesting problems: seeasked the questions before computers existed, so itnumerical analysis [IV.21 §4](/part-04/numerical-analysis)). However, Hilbert was a remarkable achievement when in 1936 church [VI.89](/part-06/alonzo-church-19031995) and turing [VI.94](/part-06/alan-turing-19121954) independently managed to

formalize the notion of what we now call anrithm [IV.20 §1](/part-04/computational-complexity). That is, they each gave a precise def-algoinition of the notion of an algorithm. Their definitions were quite different, but later shown to be equivalent, which means that anything that can be done by an algorithm in Church’s sense can be done by an algorithmin Turing’s sense, and vice versa. Turing’s formalization, which had a big influence on the design of modern computers, is discussed inity [IV.20 §1.1](/part-04/computational-complexity), while Church’s is described in computational complex-algorithms shall use the anachronistic definition with which this[II.4 §3.2](/part-02/algorithms), but for the purposes of this article we paragraph began. notion of “algorithm,” one is just a few short steps awayfrom a negative answer to Hilbert’s entscheidungspr ob-It turns out that once one has any sufficiently precise lem. To see this, imagine that language (such as Pascal or C++). Given any string of L is some programming symbols, we can ask of it the following question: if Ipresent that string of symbols to my computer as a program inally stop? This is called the L, will the program run forever, or will it eventu-halting problem. (Note that the word “problem” really means “class of problems.”) The halting problem may not seem very mathematical, but certain instances of it certainly are. For example, suppose that after a quick look at a program you realize that it does the following. In one portion of the memory it stores an even numbern, which at the beginning is set to 6. It then checks for every odd numbern whether m and n - m are both prime. If the answerm less than is yes for somethe answer is no for allm, then it adds 2 tom, then it halts. This programn and repeats. If will halt if and only if the goldbach conjecture [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859) is false.Turing proved that there is no systematic procedure for solving the halting problem analogous result for his notion of.

In this case, it shows that there is no system- bols form programs in The proof is a reductio ad absurdum, so we begin by L that halt, and which do not. assuming that there is such a procedure. Let us call it P . Suppose thata typical program asks for an L is like most computer languages, in thatinput, which affects its subsequent behavior. Thenany pair of strings(S, I), whether P will be able to tell, given S is a program in L that halts if the input is I. any string Now let us create a new procedure S, we start by getting Q to run Q out of P on the pair P . Given$708$(S, S)with itself as input, we then cause. If P judges that S does not halt when presented Q to halt. But if P judges thatinput, then we artificially send S does halt when presented with itself as Q into an endless loop, so that it does not halt. (Ifthen let us say that$Q$halts—it does not really matter S is not a valid program in L, though.) To summarize, ifdoes not halt for S, and if SSdoes not halt forhalts for input SS, then, then QQ does halt for S. But now let us suppose that S is the program for Q itself. Doeswith input SQ, sohalt with input Q does not halt. If it does not, then S? If it does, then S halts Sa contradiction, and therefore the procedure does not halt with input S, so Q does halt. This is P out of which Q was built could not have existed. That solves the general version of Hilbert’s problem: there is no algorithm that will determine the truthor falsity of arbitrary mathematical statements. But it does so by constructing, for any given algorithm, a rather artificial statement. We do not yet have an answer to the question of what happens if we lookat more specific and more natural classes of statements, such as that a given Diophantine equation hasa solution. can often be shown to be Remarkably, however, specific questions of this kind equivalent to the general question, by a technique known asthere is no algorithm that will take as its input a set encoding. For example, of polygonal tiles (suitably represented) and tell you whether it is possible to tile the plane using copies of just those tiles. How do we know this? Well, given any algorithm, there is a clever way of devising a set of tiles(this is the encoding) that will tile the plane if and only if the algorithm fails to halt. Therefore, if there were analgorithm for determining whether the tiles could tile the plane, then there would be an algorithm for solving the halting problem—but there is not. for which there is no algorithm is the Another famous example of a more specific problem word problem for groups relations for a group and asked whether the group is. Here you are given a set of generators and trivial—that is, whether it contains just the identity.Again, an algorithm that could decide this would give us an algorithm that could solve the halting problem, so there cannot be one. The encoding process used to prove this is much more difficult than it is for tiling theplane: the insolubility of the word problem for groups is a famous theorem proved by Pyotr Novikov in 1952. For a much fuller explanation of this problem and its

This has become another famous and very hard theorem, due to Yuri Matiyasevitch in 1970, who built on work of Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and Julia Robinson. Matiya-sevitch managed to produce a system of ten equations, involving two paramete rsm and n, that could be solved in integers if and only ifnumber. From Robinson’s work it followed that, givenm \text{was the} 2\text{nth Fibonacci} any algorithm with integer inputs, there was a sys-tem of Diophantine equations, involving a parameter qhalted at, that could be solved if and only if the algorithmq. That is, any instance of the halting problem can be encoded as a system of Diophantine equations, so there is no general algorithm for deciding whether Diophantine equations can be solved. Different people draw different morals from these results. In the opinion of some mathematicians, theyshow that there will always be a place for human creativity in mathematics, however powerful the com-puters of the future might be. Others maintain that although we now know that we cannot systematically solve all problems in mathematics, the effect on most mathematics is very slight: one should be aware that certain kinds of problems are sometimes equivalent tothe halting problem, and that is it. Still others point out that it is often easy to devise an algorithm to solvea problem but much harder to make it efficient. This issue is discussed in great detail in complexity [IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity). computational ing problem is closely related to Turing’s argument for the insolubility of the halt-gödel’s theorem [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem), and both proofs useare discussed in countable and uncountable sets diagonal arguments, which [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets).

But one can also take any invertible linear transformation it to Z2, and then define the torus as R2$/A(Z^{2}A)$, which, apply gives rise to another metric. A natural question to ask is, when do two choices ofric? Usually, one studies only the cases when the A give rise to the same met-deter- minantthese what happens in general.

This question is equivalent to asking howmany injective homomorphisms there are fromΓ to the group of all isometries of Hn such that the image of Γ is discrete and cocompact. (A subsetis cocompact if there is a compact subset X of a group K of G such G that R2 because XK = GR. For instance,2 = Z2+ [0,1]2 Z2 and the closed unit squareis a cocompact subset of[0, 1]2 is compact.) As we have seen, when n = 2 there is a continuum of such homomorphisms, and the sameis true in all dimensions if we replace H$n by R^{n}$. So it is rather surprising that whenn ⩾ 3, \text{the answer for Hn} is exactly 1. This is a special case of Mostow’s rigidity theorem.What does this result mean? Suppose we know that a manifold M is a quotient of Hn by some discrete cocompact group of isometries. The topology of completely determines the groupΓup to isomorphism:$M$ it is just theresult we have just stated tells us that this purely topo-fundamental group [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of M. The logical information about the manifold determines the geometry of Hn/Γ (that is, its struc-M completely ture as a metric space). More precisely, it says that any homeomorphism, or even homotopy equivalence, from M to another hyperbolic manifold N is homotopic to an isometry. In other words, any purely topological equivalence can be realized as a geometric equivalence. The full Mostow rigidity theorem concerns objects called compact locally symmetric manifolds. Givena manifold with a metric, we say that it is locally

The central symmetry at a pointif the central symmetry at every point is am is defined formally as multiplication by-1 \text{in the tangent} space to neighborhood of m: one can picture it as taking a very small$m$and “reflecting through$m$.” It turns out that every locally symmetric space is a quotient ofa symmetric space: that is, a space such that the central symmetry at every point is a global isometry. Clearly, symmetric spaces have very large isometry groups. Thework of cartan [VI.69](/part-06/lie-joseph-cartan-18691951) shows that the resulting isometry groups are exactly the semisimple[III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory).

In fact, earlier work of Calabi, Selberg, One might well ask how Mostow discovered such Vesentini, andmoduli spaces Mostow was studying were discrete: inweil [VI.93](/part-06/andr-weil-19061998) had already shown that the other words, unlike flat tori or two-dimensional hyper-bolic manifolds, higher-dimensional locally symmetric spaces could admit only a discrete set of locally symmetric metrics. Mostow has said explicitly that hewas motivated by the desire to find a more geometric understanding of this fact.Another point worth making is that Mostow’s proof is at least as surprising as his theorem. At the time, the study of locally symmetric spaces, or equivalently of semisimple Lie groups and their lattices, was domi-nated by two sets of techniques: one set that was purely algebraic and another that used classical methods in differential geometry. Mostow’s original proof (which was only for Hn) uses instead the theory of quasi- conformal mappings and some ideas from dynamics.

Raghunathan, another leading figure in the field, hassaid that when he first read Mostow’s paper, he thought it must be by a different man named Mostow. Simi-lar uses of surprising dynamical and analytical ideas to study the same objects occurred almost simultane-ously in work of Furstenberg and Margulis. These ideas have had a long and interesting legacy in the study oflocally symmetric spaces, semisimple Lie groups, and related objects.

V.24 The P versus NP Problem The P versus NP problem is widely considered to be the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science, and one of the most important in all of mathematics.computational complexity classes P and NP are two of the most basic[III.10](/part-03/computational-complexity-classes): P is the class of all computational tasks that can be performedin a time that is polynomial in the length of the input, and NP is the class of all computational tasks where a correct answer can benomial in the length of the input. An example of the verified in a time that is poly former is multiplying twoif you use long multiplication, takes roughlyn-digit integers (which, evenn^2 arith- metical operations). An example of the latter is search-ing in a graph [III.34] withn vertices for a set of m vertices, any two of which are joined by an edge: if youare presented withm such vertices, then you just have to check thethat each pair is indeed an edge of the graph.m2 pairs of those vertices to make sure are all joined than to check that a givenall joined. This suggests that problems in It appears to be much harder to find mm vertices that vertices are NP are in
