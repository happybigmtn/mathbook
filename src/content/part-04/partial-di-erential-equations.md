For instance, one useful such statement is the Vitali covering lemma, which asserts that, given any collection will be a subcollection$B^{1}$, . . . , Bk of balls in Euclidean space B , . . . , B of balls that are dis-Rn, there joint, but that nevertheless contain a significant frac-tion of the volume covered by the original balls.
To be$(i1)i m$ precise, one can choose the disjoint balls so that vol$j$.m = 1 (Bi)j ⩾ 5-n volj.=k 1 Bj.(The constant 5-n can be improved, but this will not concern us here.) This result is obtained by a “greedy algorithm”: one picks balls one by one, at each stage choosing the largest ball among the B that is dis jointj

Given any function Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequalityf \in , which we will L1(Rn)$, anyx \in Rn$, and any r > 0, we can calculate the average$of$|f | in the n-dimensional sphere B(x, r ) of center x and radius F of f by lettingr.

IV.12 Partial Differential Equations Sergiu Klainerman Introduction Partial differential equations (or PDEs) are an important class ofor systems of equations, in which the unknowns are functional equations: they are equations, functions of more than one variable.
As a very crude analogy, PDEs are to functions as polynomial equations (such asx2 + y2 = 1, for example) are to num - bers. The distinguishing feature of PDEs, as opposed tomore general functional equations, is that they involve not only unknown functions, but also various derivatives of those functions, in algebraic combina-partial tion with each other and with other, fixed, functions.
Other important kinds of functional equations are gral equations, which involve various integrals of the in te unknown functions, and(ODEs), in which the unknown functions depend onordinary differential equations only one independent variable (such as a time variable td) and the equation involves only ordinary derivatives/dt, d2/dt2, d3/dt3, . . . of these functions. hope to do is to give a very crude perspective on some Given the immense scope of the subject the best I can of the main issues and an even cruder idea of the mul-titude of current research directions.
The difficulty one faces in trying to describe the subject of PDEs starts with its very definition. Is it a unified area of mathematics, devoted to the study of a clearly defined set of objects (in the way that algebraic geometry studies solutions of polynomial equations or topology studies manifolds, for example), or is it rather a collection ofseparate fields, such as general relativity, several complex variables, or hydrodynamics, each one vast in its own right and centered on a particular, very difficult, equation or class of equations? I will attempt to argue
