of least action was replaced by a generalization of the
Bernoullian principle of “virtual velocities,” which were     tions Analytiques (1797) he then showed (or, rather,
expressed by variations. Using what are now known as
generalized coordinates, φi (that is, mutually indepen-
dent coordinates in the configuration space of a dis-
crete system that characterize completely the position
of its bodies), Lagrange derived the equations that are
now named after him:

where T and U are the kinetic and potential energy of
the system, respectively.
   The Méchanique Analitique appeared a century after
newton’s [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) Principia and marked the culmina-
tion of a purely analytical approach to mechanics. In
the preface Lagrange proudly stated that no diagrams
would be found in the work and that everything would
be reduced to “algebraic operations submitted to a
regular and uniform progression.”
  Lagrange made fundamental contributions to per-
turbation theory and the three-body problem [V.33](/part-05/the-three-body-problem)
with research published in the 1770 s and 1780 s. His
methods were further developed by laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827)
in his Mécanique Céleste and formed the basis for
subsequent mathematical work in physical astronomy.
   The method of indeterminate coefficients, or rather
its extension to power series, is also the crucial tech-
nique underlying Lagrange’s approach to the calculus.
In a memoir which appeared in the Proceedings of the
Berlin Academy (1768) he used it to prove an important
result connecting the calculus to the theory of algebraic     rem (first guessed by Wilson and published by waring
equations, the so-called Lagrange in version theorem,
which states that a function ψ(p) of a root p of an
equation t − x + φ(x) = 0, where φ(x) is an arbitrary
function of x, can be expanded in a series based on the
Taylor expansions of φ(t) and ψ(t) (the precise con-
ditions to be satisfied by x, φ(x), and ψ(t) were later
clarified by cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and Roché).
  In a memoir of 1772 Lagrange returned to power
series and proved that if a function f (x + h) has a
power-series expansion in h, then this series can be
written in the form
where, for any i, f (i+1) is derived from f (i) in the same   including the laplace transform [III.91](/part-03/transforms), the Laplace
way that f derives from f . Thus, he just had to prove,
through an infinitesimal argument, that f = df /dx
to conclude that the only power-series expansion of

a function is its Taylor series. In Théorie des Fonc-
claimed to have shown), with out making an appeal to
the differential calculus, that any function f (x +h) can
be expanded in a power series, and suggested inter-
preting the differential formalism as a formalism that
applies to the coefficients of hi /i! in such an expansion.
In other words, he suggested defining the differential
d ∂T
−       +     = 0,                y = f (x)) as derivative functions supplying these coef-

ficients, where as previously these had been thought of
as genuine ratios of differentials. He also proved that
the remainder of a Taylor series could be written in the
form now known as the Lagrange remainder.
The main results obtained by Lagrange within the
theory of algebraic equations were presented in a long
memoir of 1770 and 1771 in which the formulas for
solving equations of degree 2, 3, and 4 were obtained
through an analysis of permutations of the roots.
This work constituted the starting point for the later
researches of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and galois [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832). In the
same memoir Lagrange stated a particular but signif-
icant case of the theorem in group theory that today
bears his name: that the order of a subgroup of a finite
group divides the order of the group.
Lagrange also obtained important results in number
theory. Arguably the most significant were the proof of
a conjecture, advanced by fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665) (among oth-
ers) and which Euler had already tried to prove, assert-
ing that any positive integer is the sum of (at most)
four squares (1770), and the proof of Wilson’s theo-
[VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) with out proof), asserting that if n is prime, then
(n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n (1771).

sion, and the laplacian [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or potential function.     subject in itself.
Laplace developed the fields of celestial mechanics (the
phrase was his coinage) and probability, and along the
way the mathematics to service and advance them. For
Laplace, celestial mechanics and probability were com-
ple ment ary instruments that implemented a unified
vision of a fully determined universe. Celestial mechan-
ics vindicated the Newtonian system of the world. Prob-
ability was the measure, not of the operations of chance
in nature, for there are none, but of human ignorance
of causes, which was to be reduced to virtual certainty
by calculation. The third reason for Laplace’s impor-
tance to the history of science was the mathematiza-
tion of physics in the first two decades of the nine-
teenth century. Apart from a few formulations—speed
of sound, capillary action, refractive indices of gases—
his role there was that of instigator and patron rather
than of major contributor.
   Laplace came up with the majority of the above con-
cepts in a probabilistic context. The earliest hints of
the method of solving difference, differential, and inte-
gral equations, later known as the Laplace transform,
appeared in “Mémoire sur les suites” (1782 a), where
Laplace introduced generating functions. Laplace con-
side red generating functions to be the approach of
choice in solving problems that involved the develop-
ment of functions in series and evaluation of the sums.
Years later, in composing Théorie Analytique des Prob-
abilités (1812), he subordinated all the analytical part
to the theory of generating functions and treated the
entire subject as their field of application. In the early
memoir, however, he emphasized what he expected to
be their applicability to problems of nature.
   In an even earlier paper, “Mémoire sur la proba-
bilité des causes par les événements” (1774), Laplace
stated the theorem permitting the analysis later termed
bayesian [III.3](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Unknown to Laplace, Thomas Bayes
had arrived at the same theorem eleven years earlier
but had not developed it. Laplace for his part pro-
ceeded, in further investigations over some thirty years,     analysis of other phenomena that Laplace explored, it
to develop inverse probability into the basis for sta-
tistical inference, philosophical causality, estimation of    etary motions are periodic over many centuries. Thus,
scientific error, quantification of the credibility of evi-     they are not derogations from the law of gravity but
dence, and optimal voting rules in the proceedings of
legislative bodies and judicial panels. His initial attrac-   planet attractions that had been studied by newton
tion to the approach was its applicability to human
concerns. It was in the course of these papers, most
notably “Mémoire sur les probabilités” (1780), that the
word probability came to connote not merely the basic

753
quantity in the theory of games and chance but a
Laplace first addressed error theory in the above
paper on causality. The problem was to estimate the
most appropriate mean value to be taken in a series of
astronomical observations of the same phenomenon.
He also determined how the limits of the error were
related to the number of observations (“Mémoire sur les
probabilités” above). In “Essai pour connaître la popu-
lation du Royaume” (1783–91) Laplace turned to demo-
graphic applications. In the absence of census data, one
needed to determine the multiplier to be applied to the
number of births at any one time in order to estimate
the approximate size of a population. The specific prob-
lem Laplace solved was the size of the sample required
for the probability of error to fall within given limits.
Laplace then put probabilistic investigation aside.
Only twenty-five years later did he return to the subject,
in the course of preparing the comprehensive Théorie
Analytique des Probabilités. In 1810 he returned to the
problem of determining the mean value from a large
number of observations, which he interpreted as the
problem of the probability that the mean value falls
within certain limits. He proved a law of large numbers,
stating that if positive and negative errors in an indefi-
nitely large number of observations are assumed to be
equally possible, then their mean result converges to a
limit in a precise way. From this analysis followed the
least-squares law of error. A priority dispute over the
discovery of that law was even then simmering between
gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833).
In a long series of investigations brought together in
Traité de Mécanique Céleste (1799–1825, five volumes),
the two part “Mémoire sur la Théorie de Jupiter et de
Saturne” (1788) demonstrates the most famous of his
findings in planetary astronomy. He established that
the current acceleration in orbital motion of Jupiter and
the deceleration of Saturn are the reciprocal effects of
their mutual gravitation, which are cyclical over many
hundreds of years and not cumulative. From this and
followed that the so-called secular inequalities of plan-
evidence that its validity extended beyond the Sun–
[VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727). He was never able to prove, however, that lunar
acceleration is self-correcting over time.

theory of determinants first appears in the background
