Pisa, Italy, ca. 1250 Son of Pisan merchant; studied mathematics under Muslim teachers in North Africa and traveled through out the Mediterranean meeting with Islamic scholars; awarded an annual stipend in 1240 by the city of Pisa in recognition of his teaching and other services One of the earliest European writers on algebra, Fibonacci is most famous for his culation”), which first appeared in 1202 and was largely Liber Abaci (“Book of cal responsible for the spread of the Hindu–Arabic numer-als through out Europe.

It con-tained many new ideas, including methods (not all Cardano’s own) for solving cubic and quartic equations, all written without mathematical notation. Cardano’s own great insight was to recognize the existence ofrelations between the roots and the coefficients of an equation; in this he was unprecedented. He also showeda greater readiness than most of his contemporaries to contemplate the square roots of negative numbers.He is remembered today for “Cardano’s rule” for solving cubic equations of the form$x3 + cx = d$, where

Probably Rome, after 1572 Engineer–architect for the Roman nobleman Alessandro Rufini, later Bishop of Melfi Bombelli was prompted to write his Algebra (1572) by a desire to make accessible to the less sophisticated reader. The cardano’s [VI.7](/part-06/girolamo-cardano-15011576) Ars Magna (1545)Algebraics, cubics, and quartics, is noted for its advances in, which contains a systematic treatment of quadrat mathematical notation—it was the first printed text toinclude a notation for exponents—and for its role in disseminating awareness of the work of Diophantus.Above all, the Algebra was renowned for solving certain special cases of the so-called casus irreducibilis of the cubic, those in which Cardano’s rule appears to giverise to a complex or “impossible” solution. Cardano was aware that what we today call complex numbers (num-bers of the forma + b\sqrt{-1}) could arise in the solution of quadratic equations. Bombelli made the important discovery that what at first sight appears to be a complex root of a cubic equation may in fact be a real root, because the imaginary parts cancel each other out. The Algebra plex numbers and Bombelli formulated the four basic included the first extensive discussion of com operations of arithmetic for them. VI.9 François Viète b. Fontenay-le-Comte, France, 1540; d. Paris, 1603 Trigonometry; algebraic analysis; classical problems; numerical solution of equations Viète obtained a bachelor’s degree in law in 1560 from the University of Poitiers, but left the profession from1564 to 1568 to oversee the education of Catherine de Parthenay, daughter of a local aristocratic family. His earliest scientific writings were his lectures to Catherine. He spent the remainder of his life in high public office, apart from a period between 1584 and 1589 when he was banished from the court in Paris for political and religious reasons. He died in Paris in 1603.Through out his life, it was only during the time he had free from official duties that he was able to devote himself to mathematics. during the 1590 s, beginning with The work for which Viète is best known appeared In Artem Analyticem Isagoge In the Isagoge(“Introduction to the analytic art”) in 1591.Viète began to combine classical Greek

geometry with algebraic methods that had originated from Islamic sources, and in doing so laid the foundations for the algebraic approach to geometry. Viète saw that the symbols in equations (traditionally variants of R, Q, and C, for the unknown, its square, and its cube) could represent either numbers or geometric quanti-ties, and that this was potentially a powerful tool for analyzing and solving geometric problems. reading of thefourth century Viète’s understanding of analysis was based on his Synagogec.e.), where analysis was described as(“Collection”) of Pappus (early a method of investigating a problem by assuming thatthe solution is in some sense known, as we would do now by representing the solution by a symbol and car-rying out mathematical manipulations involving that symbol. Algebra achieves this by regarding all quan-tities, known or unknown, as of equal status; equations are then formed from prestated conditions (a process Viète called unknown quantity in terms of those given (zetetics), and solved to produce the exegetics). For Viète the final step in geometric problems was toprovide a specific construction for the solution: this was the geometric synthesis arising from the preceding algebraic In several further treatises, mostly written or pub-analysis. lished around 1593, Viète taught the necessary skillsof forming equations and carrying out the corresponding geometric constructions, and these books together made up hisseu Algebra Nova Opus Restitutae Mathematicae Analyseos,(“The work of restored mathematical analysis, or the new algebra”), which he offered with thefamous and ambitious hope of leaving no mathematical problem unsolved (nullum problema non solvere). For most of the seventeenth century, algebra continued tobe known as the “analytic art,” or simply “analysis.” algebraically, Viète also put forward a method ofnumerical solution based on successive approxima-Recognizing that not all equations could be solved tions. This was the first appearance of such techniques in Europe, and was important not only for practical purposes, but also because it rapidly led to a deeper understanding of the relationships between roots and coefficients of equations. thanks in part to his liking for technical Greek terms.In his algebraic treatises, however, he devised some Viète’s style of writing is wordy and often obscure, rudimentary notation.

Stockholm, 1650 Algebra; geometry; analytic geometry; foundations of mathematics In 1637 Descartes published La Géométrie as an “essay” appended to his philosophical treatise Méthode. It remained his only mathematical publica-Discours de la tion. No single early modern text shaped the devel-opment of mathematics between 1650 and 1700 as strongly asanalytic geometry and it paved the way for the merging La Géométrie. It was the founding text of of algebra and geometry that made possible the devel-opment of the integral and differential calculus about fifty years later.Descartes was educated at the Jesuit College at La Flèche. He spent his life mostly outside France, travel-ing through Europe in his early twenties and living in the Netherlands from 1628 until 1649; he then left for Sweden, invited by Queen Christina to her court. From an early age his interest in mathematics was tightly linked to his primary philosophical preoccupation: the certainty of knowledge. In a letter of 1619 he sketcheda method, clearly inspired by arithmetic and geometry, for solving all problems in natural philosophy. shortly afterward, his ideas grew into a passionate conviction that he could and should develop a philosophy along these problem-solving and mathematics-inspired lines.

Descartes offered little in the way ofgeneral principles, explaining his ideas by means of examples.Descartes used a classical problem, Pappus’s problem, in order to explain coordinates and equations ofcurves, and showed that the defining property of a curve could be written as an equation. He introduced coordinate sx and y, using oblique as well as rectan- gular coordinate axes, which he always adjusted to the problem at hand. He also introduced the now very common usage of employinga, b, and cfor indeterminate fixed quantities.x, y , and z for unknowns and metrical answer. The equation was at best an algebraic reformulation of the problem; the answer had to be a For Descartes, a geometrical problem required a geo construction of the curve or of individual points. If, asin the particular case of Pappus’s problem in four lines, the equation was quadratic, then for any fixed value of y Earlier in the book Descartes had shown how such athe x-coordinate was a root of a quadratic equation.

There-xs and points on the curve. Pointwise fore in Pappus’s problem Descartes used the equationto show that the solution curves were conic sections, and explained how to determine the nature of the conic, the location of its axes, and the values of its parameters.This was an impressive result; it was, in fact, the first classification of an algebraically defined class of curves. one of which Descartes himself said he was most proud, A further influential result in La Géométrie, and the was his method to determine the normal (and thusalso the tangent) at a given point on a curve with a given equation. It was a pre-calculus forerunner of differentiation. Descartes treated curves and their equations and how There are three important differences between how they are treated in modern analytic geometry: heemployed oblique as well as rectangular axes; he did not consider the equation as defining a curve—ratherit represented a problem, namely to construct the curve itself, as well as its axes, tangents, etc.; and he did not consider the plane itself as a collection of points char-acterized by pairs of real numbers—for him thexs andyof line segments.

He gave no proofs; his results were based on a convic-tion that polynomials could essentially be written as products of linear factorsx - xi, in which the roots xi could be positive, negative, or “imaginary.”It appears, then, that analytic geometry was not the primary goal ofprovide a universal method for solving geometrical La Géométrie. Rather, its aim was to problems, and to do so Descartes had to answer two urgent methodological questions. The first was how tosolve geometrical problems not constructible by ruler and compass, and the second was how to use algebraas an analytic, i.e., solution-finding, tool in geometry. For the first of these, Descartes allowed successively more complicated curves as means of construction. Itwas Descartes’s conviction that algebra, through the equations of these curves, could guide him to choose, among all such construction curves, the most appropriate for the problem, in particular the simplest, i.e., that of lowest degree.The second question addressed serious conceptual difficulties that were felt at the time about using alge-bra in geometry. The transfer of algebraic operations to geometry was indeed problematic because multiplication in geometry was generally interpreted dimen-sionally: for example, a product of two lengths had to represent an area, and a product of three a volume.But until then algebra had dealt mostly with numbers and had routinely used products of more than three factors. Thus, a consistent and unrestricted geomet-rical interpretation of the operations of algebra was needed. Descartes did indeed provide such a reinter-pretation. He introduced a unit line segment in such a way that multiplication no longer raised the dimension and in homogeneous terms could be allowed inequations. link philosophy and mathematics. Yet the preoccupa-tion with certainty remained. As his concept of con-By 1637 he had given up on his earlier attempts to struction involved the use of curves, he had to consider which curves could be understood by the human mind

with sufficient clarity to be acceptable in geometry. Hisanswer was that all algebraic curves were acceptable (he called these “geometrical curves”) and all others werenot (these he called “mechanical”). Few seventeenth century mathematicians followed Descartes in this strict demarcation of geometry. This is typical of the reception of Descartes’s La Géométrie: the philosophical and methodological aspects of the book were largely ignored by his mathematical readers, but the technical mathematical aspects were eagerly accepted and used.

Very little is known about his early life—even the date of his birth is uncertain—but by 1629 he had close contacts with viète’s [VI.9](/part-06/franois-vite-15401603) scientific heirs in Bordeaux.

Viète and other algebraists before him had used equations in a single unknown A crucial early-modern topic was the use of algebra to to rewrite and solve “determinate” problems (prob-lems admitting a finite number of solutions). In his manuscript circulated in Paris in 1637 (the same year as Descartes’s Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge, which La Géométriedling and solving indeterminate problems associated), Fermat presented a general way of hanwith constructions of loci: that is, of sets of points (usu-ally curves) defined by some constraints. He identified

VI.13. Blaise Pascal

the points of such loci by two coordinates linked by anequation (although he chose a different way of taking coordinates from the usual modernx and y coordin- ates). Moreover, Fermat gave the standard forms of the corresponding equation when the locus to be found was a line, a parabola, an ellipse, etc.Fermat also used algebraic analysis to solve problems of extrema, including finding the tangent or the normal to a curve at a given point, and determining centers of gravity. His method relies on the principle that a certain algebraic expression takes on the same values twice near the extremum. Although the procedure is purely algebraic, his successors tended to interpret it from a differential perspective, thereby makinghis work an apparent precursor of the calculus. Fermat applied the method to a variety of problems, includ-ing (within the framework of a controversy with Descartes’s followers around 1660) a proof of the law of refraction in optics. Basing his analysis on the principle that “nature acts in the shortest time,” Fermat was able to express the problem as one of extrema and to solve itwith his method. The problem of refraction was one of the first complex physical problems to be treated in a thoroughly mathematical way, and Fermat’s approach later led to variational methods [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). \text{more classical}, \text{for instance Archimedean}, techniques, \text{which he used when dealing with other types of geo} - However, \text{Fermat also showed a perfect mastery of metrical questions such as quadrature}.\text{Such versatility also appears in Fermat}’s \text{work on numbers}. \text{On the one hand}, \text{he was happy to apply his algebraic approach to Diophantine analysis in order to obtain solutions for cases previously thought to be insoluble}, \text{or to derive new solutions from ones already known}. \text{On the other hand}, \text{he advocated a theoretical study of the integers}, \text{for which the currently available algebraic theory of equations was not sufficient}. \text{For example}, \text{he gave general properties of the divisors ofnumbers of the forman} ± 1 (\text{among them his now cel}- \text{ebr at ed various Nlittle theorem}. \text{He invented the method of infinite descent}[III.58](/part - 03/modular - arithmetic)) \text{and of} x2 + Ny2 for specifically to deal with problems concerning integers.He used this method, which relies on the impossibility of constructing an infinite strictly decreasing sequenceof integers, to prove that$a^{4} - b^{4} = c^{2} \text{has no nontrivial}$ integer solutions.

b. Leipzig, Germany, 1646; d. Hanover, Germany, 1716 Calculus; theory of linear equations and elimination theory; logic Renowned among mathematicians for his invention ofthe calculus, Leibniz was a universal thinker who graduated in law and was self-taught in mathematics. In1676 he became counselor and librarian in Hanover for the Duke Johann Friedrich of Braunschweig–Lüneburg, holding this position until the end of his life. Besides mathematics he occupied himself with technical, his-tor io graphical, political, religious, and philosophical questions. His philosophy distinguished between twoareas of reality: the world of appearances and the world of substances. It was in developing his philosophy thathe was led to declare that the real world is “the best of all possible worlds.” In 1700 he was appointed first president of the newly founded Brandenburg Society of Sciences established in Berlin.

He was always more interested in general or even universal methods than in technical details, using analogy and inductive reasoning to develop the art ofinvention. For the same reason he became a key creator of mathematical notation: he knew how much a suitable notation could facilitate mathematical discoveries. treatise on infinitesimal geometry (written in 1675–76 but not published until 1993). In it he used his “quanta”One of Leibniz’s earliest mathematical works was a concept of the infinite. In Leibniz’s eyes the actual infi-nite as well as indivisibles, in the strictest sense of the word, were not quantities and therefore not mathemati-cal entities: hence, he used the notions “infinitely small” and “infinitely large.” These denoted, it is true, variable quantities, but nevertheless they were quantities of a sort, so they could be handled by mathematics. Among the results in this treatise is a rigorous proof, in thestyle of archimedes [VI.3](/part-06/archimedes-ca), \text{of the existence of} (\text{what is today known as}) \text{the continuous functions}, \text{which is based on intermediary riemann integral} [I.3 §5.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) \text{of values of the function within subintervals}. \text{Only a fewof these results were actually published by Leibniz}, \text{and even these mainly without proof}: in 1682 \text{the alternat}-\text{ing series for}$π/$4; in 1691 \text{some further results}.

Moscow, 1764 Professor of Mathematics, Imperial Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg (1725–28); tutor to Tsarevitch Peter II, Moscow(1728–30); corresponding secretary and administrator, Imperial Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg (1732–42); Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1742–64) Goldbach is remembered today for the conjecture that bears his name: that every even number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes. This was first stated by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in 1742 in a letter to Goldbach in response to the earlier proposal by Goldbach that every number greater than 2 is a sum of three primes (Goldbach considered1 as a prime number). Goldbach’s conjecture, together with the weaker conjecture that every odd number iseither prime or the sum of three primes, was first published bytion. Both conjectures remain unsolved. However, Vino-waring [VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) in 1770 but without attribugradov proved that every sufficiently large odd numberis the sum of three primes: see problems and results in additive number theory [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859).

such was the family’s importance that in 1715[VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) coined the term “bernoullizare” to describe the leibniz activity of doing mathematics. Altogether eight members of the family devoted themselves to the mathe-matical sciences (including physics, especially mechanics and fluid mechanics), and from 1687 to 1790 the mathematics chair of the university of Basel was occupied by successive members of the family: first Jacob (1687–1705), \text{then his brother Johann} (1705–48), and finally Johann’s son, Johann II (1748–90). Through out the eighteenth century Bernoullis were members of the Paris Academy of Sciences and individually they won prestigious prizes on many occasions.

The first Bernoullito settle in Basel was Jacob, a druggist, who became The family goes back to a line of Calvinist merchants a citizen in 1622. His grandson, Jacob I, studied phi-losophy and theology in Basel before turning to mathematics, against the will of his father.

Jacob computed these numbers up to B10. Johann, who had to study medicine before he could devote himself to mathematics, got his first mathe-matical training from his brother Jacob, with whom he developed numerous applications of the new Leib-nizian calculus to mechanics. An academic peregrination brought him to Paris in 1691–92, where he gave private lessons to Guillaume de l’Hôpital. These lessons are the basis of l’Hôpital’s famous Analyse des Infiniment Petitslus, contains l’Hôpital’s rule, which Johann had com-(1696).

In 1695, Johann left Basel for Groningen to take up a professorship in mathematics. friendly collaboration between the two brothers Jacob With the growing visibility of Johann’s work, the and Johann transformed into an endless round of con-troversies, priority disputes, and public accusations. They engaged in heated struggles concerning the solution of the brachistochrone (curve of fastest descent)problem, and a complicated isoperimetric problem that involved minimizing the area enclosed by a curve offixed length. Eventually, these bitter quarrels led to an interesting mathematical outcome: the creation of the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). After Jacob’s death, Johann took over the mathematics chair in Basel, wherehe taught until the end of his life, attracting students from all over Europe, including euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783). Johann’s most important achievement in mathematics is the development of the integral calculus. He devel-oped a general theory for the integration of rational functions and new methods for the solution of dif-ferential equations. He also extended the infinitesimal calculus to handle exponential functions [III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions).

Basel with his uncle Jacob before taking a degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence (1709). He was the professor Nicolaus I studied mathematics at the university of of mathematics in Padua, occupying the chair once heldby Galileo, and he later held the professorship of logic in Basel. His main interests in mathematics were infi-nite series and the applications of probability theory to questions of law. He formulated, in 1713, the notorious Saint Petersburg paradox, which originated witha gambling game. Suppose that Peter is tossing a fair coin, and he will give Paul one ducat if the coin turnsup heads on the first toss, two ducats if it shows heads for the first time on the second toss, and in general 2 n - 1\text{ducats if the coin turns up heads for the first time onthenth toss}. \text{The standard calculation shows that the} \text{value of Paul}’s expectation (1 2 n - 1 +· · ·) \text{is infinitely great}. \text{Nevertheless no} “fairly E =1 21 +1 42 +1 84 + · · · +reasonable man” would be willing to pay even a moder-2 n ately high price to purchase Paul’s prospects. The resultof the mathematical analysis clearly affronted common sense; this was the paradox. Nicolaus’s cousin, Daniel, discussed the problem while he was staying in Saint Petersburg (hence the name given to the paradox). His strategy was to distinguish two senses of expectation, one mathematical and the other moral. The latter was to take into account the individual characteristics ofthe risk taker (his wealth, for instance).

In 1747 d’Alembert dis-cussed various possibilities for solving the problem— an additional force, or a very irregular shape for the Moon, or some vortices between Earth and Moon—and produced a long study on celestial mechanics and planetary perturbations that has only recently been redis-covered and published (see d’Alembert 2002). By 1749 an improved mathematical analysis of the problem had shown that Newton’s theory was correct. The rest of d’Alembert’s extensive work on celestial mechanics was published in hisÉquinoxes (1749), Recherches sur Différents Points du Recherches sur la Précession des Système du Monde volumes of his Opuscules(1754–56), and in some of the eight(1761–83). problem of vibrating strings, que Forme une Corde Tendue Mise en Vibration In 1747 d’Alembert presented a paper on the famous Recherches sur la Courbe(1749).

This is a typical example of Lagrange’s reductionist style. Through out his career he sought suitable for-malisms with which to express and solve the key problems of mathematical analysis.Lagrange publicly presented hisδ-formalism in a memoir published in the second volume (1760–61) of Miscellanea Taurinensia, a review he had helped to found. He coupled this memoir with another in whichhe used the same formalism to formulate a generalized version of the principle of least action (previously intro-duced by Maupertuis and Euler). As a result, he was able to derive the equations of motion of any system of dis-tinct bodies attracted by central forces depending on the distances from their centers. ne ns i a sent ing a new approach to the problem of the vibrating Meanwhile, in the first volume of(1759), Lagrange had published a memoir pre-Miscellanea Tauristring, where the string is first represented as a dis-crete system ofn particles, and n is then allowed to tend to infinity. Using this method Lagrange argued that Euler was right to allow a large class of “func-tions,” both “continuous” and “discontinuous,” as solutions of this problem, whereas maintained that only “continuous functions” (that is, d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) had curves expressed by a single equation) could count assolutions. foundations of classical mechanics in these memoirs.It was based on the interpretation of a continuous Lagrange established a very general program in the system as a limiting case of a discrete one and theuse of the method of indeterminate coefficients: supposing that fic i en ts a (i P (x)= 0, . . . , nis a polynomial in) depend on some indetermi-x, whose coef-i

nates, and that P (x) = 0 for all x (in a given interval), this method consists of deducing the system of equa-tions${a = 0}^{i}=^{n}$, from which the indeterminates are possibly determined. Lagrange extended this methodto sums of polynomials in several (independent) vari-$i^{i} = 0$ ables, and (following Euler, d’Alembert, and many oth-ers) also used it with respect to power series. This program was further elaborated in two memoirs on themotion of the Moon (1764, 1780), and later realized in the Méchanique Analitique (1788). Here, the principle

of least action was replaced by a generalization of the Bernoullian principle of “virtual velocities,” which were expressed by variations. Using what are now known as generalized coordinates,φ (that is, mutually indepen-i

His methods were further developed by laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) in his Mécanique Céleste and formed the basis for subsequent mathematical work in physical astronomy. The method of indeterminate coefficients, or rather its extension to power series, is also the crucial tech-nique underlying Lagrange’s approach to the calculus. In a memoir which appeared in the Berlin Academy (1768) he used it to prove an important Proceedings of the result connecting the calculus to the theory of algebraic equations, the so-called Lagrange inversion theorem, which states that a functionψ(p) of a root p of an equationt - x + φ(x) = 0, where φ(x) \text{is an arbitrary} function of Taylor expansions ofx, can be expanded in a series based on theφ(t) and ψ(t) (the precise con- ditions to be satisfied byclarified by cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and Roché).x, φ(x), and ψ(t) were later series and proved that if a function power-series expansion in In a memoir of 1772 Lagrange returned to powerh, then this series can bef (x + h) has a written in the form\infty f(i)(x) hi, i!

a function is its Taylor series. Intions Analytiques (1797) he then showed (or, rather, Théorie des Fonc claimed to have shown), without making an appeal tothe differential calculus, that any function$f (x + h) can$ be expanded in a power series, and suggested inter-preting the differential formalism as a formalism that applies to the coefficients of$h^{i}/i$! in such an expansion. In other words, he suggested defining the differential ratios of any order (that is, the ratios d$iy/dx^{i}$, wherey = f (x)) as derivative functions supplying these coef- ficients, whereas previously these had been thought ofas genuine ratios of differentials. He also proved that the remainder of a Taylor series could be written in theform now known as the Lagrange remainder. theory of algebraic equations were presented in a long The main results obtained by Lagrange within the memoir of 1770 and 1771 in which the formulas for solving equations of degree 2, 3, and 4 were obtained through an analysis of permutations of the roots.This work constituted the starting point for the later researches ofsame memoir Lagrange stated a particular but signif-abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and galois [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832).

least-squares rule of error by means of a linear regres-sion, and the laplacian [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or potential function. Laplace developed the fields of celestial mechanics (the phrase was his coinage) and probability, and along theway the mathematics to service and advance them. For Laplace, celestial mechanics and probability were com-ple ment ary instruments that implemented a unified vision of a fully determined universe. Celestial mechanics vindicated the Newtonian system of the world. Prob-ability was the measure, not of the operations of chance in nature, for there are none, but of human ignoranceof causes, which was to be reduced to virtual certainty by calculation. The third reason for Laplace’s importance to the history of science was the mathematiza-tion of physics in the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Apart from a few formulations—speedof sound, capillary action, refractive indices of gases— his role there was that of instigator and patron rather than of major contributor.Laplace came up with the majority of the above concepts in a probabilistic context. The earliest hints ofthe method of solving difference, differential, and integral equations, later known as the Laplace transform, appeared in “Mémoire sur les suites” (1782 a), where Laplace introduced generating functions. Laplace considered generating functions to be the approach ofchoice in solving problems that involved the development of functions in series and evaluation of the sums. Years later, in composingabilités (1812), he subordinated all the analytical part Théorie Analytique des Probto the theory of generating functions and treated theentire subject as their field of application. In the early memoir, however, he emphasized what he expected to be their applicability to problems of nature.In an even earlier paper, “Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements” (1774), laplace stated the theorem permitting the analysis later termed bayesian [III.3](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Unknown to Laplace, Thomas Bayes had arrived at the same theorem eleven years earlier but had not developed it. Laplace for his part proceeded, in further investigations over some thirty years, to develop inverse probability into the basis for statistical inference, philosophical causality, estimation of scientific error, quantification of the credibility of evi-dence, and optimal voting rules in the proceedings of legislative bodies and judicial panels. His initial attrac-tion to the approach was its applicability to human concerns. It was in the course of these papers, most notably “Mémoire sur les probabilités” (1780), that the word probability came to connote not merely the basic

753

quantity in the theory of games and chance but asubject in itself. paper on causality. The problem was to estimate the Laplace first addressed error theory in the above most appropriate mean value to be taken in a series of astronomical observations of the same phenomenon. He also determined how the limits of the error were related to the number of observations (“Mémoire sur les probabilités” above). In “Essai pour connaître la population du Royaume” (1783–91) Laplace turned to demo-graphic applications. In the absence of census data, one needed to determine the multiplier to be applied to thenumber of births at any one time in order to estimate the approximate size of a population. The specific problem Laplace solved was the size of the sample required for the probability of error to fall within given limits. Only twenty-five years later did he return to the subject, in the course of preparing the comprehensive Laplace then put probabilistic investigation aside.Théorie Analytique des Probabilitésproblem of determining the mean value from a large. In 1810 he returned to the number of observations, which he interpreted as the problem of the probability that the mean value falls within certain limits. He proved a law of large numbers, stating that if positive and negative errors in an indefi-nitely large number of observations are assumed to be equally possible, then their mean result converges to alimit in a precise way. From this analysis followed the least-squares law of error. A priority dispute over the discovery of that law was even then simmering between gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833). Traité de Mécanique Célestethe two part “Mémoire sur la Théorie de Jupiter et de In a long series of investigations brought together in(1799–1825, five volumes), Saturne” (1788) demonstrates the most famous of his findings in planetary astronomy. He established that the current acceleration in orbital motion of Jupiter andthe deceleration of Saturn are the reciprocal effects of their mutual gravitation, which are cyclical over many hundreds of years and not cumulative. From this and analysis of other phenomena that Laplace explored, it followed that the so-called secular inequalities of plan-etary motions are periodic over many centuries. Thus, they are not derogations from the law of gravity but evidence that its validity extended beyond the Sun–planet attractions that had been studied by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727). He was never able to prove, however, that lunar acceleration is self-correcting over time. The expansion known by Laplace’s name in the theory of determinants first appears in the background

754

of the Jupiter–Saturn memoir in an analysis of the eccentricities and inclinations of orbits, “Recherches sur le calcul intégral et sur le système du monde” (1776). Except for that, Laplace’s mathematical original-ity is less notable in his analysis of planetary motion than in his development of the theory of probability.More in evidence in his astronomical work is his motivational drive and his power and virtuosity in calculation, which may indeed have been more important through out his long career. Laplace was masterful in finding rapidly convergent series, in obtaining mathe-matical expressions incorporating terms to represent a multitude of physical phenomena, in justifying the neglect of in convenient quantities in order to reach solutions, and in giving the widest possible generality to his conclusions.The attraction exerted by a spheroid on an external or internal point proved to be mathematically the most fertile set of problems in Laplacian planetary astron-omy. In “Théorie des attractions des sphéroïdes et de la figure des planètes” (1785) Laplace employed dre polynomials [III.85](/part-03/special-functions) in a form later called laplace le gen functions. He also proved a theorem that stated that all ellipsoids with the same foci for their principal sections attract a given point with a force proportional to their masses. Laplace’s angles appear in his development ofthe equation for the attraction of a spheroid on a given point. Laplace used polar coordinates in this analy-sis. He transformed the equation into one in Cartesian coordinates in “Mémoire sur la théorie de l’anneau de Saturne” (1789). In 1828 George Green dubbed Poisson’s application of the formula to electrostatic and magnetic forces the potential function, the term used there after in classical physics.

Little in the book was new; while expanded editions appeared in 1808 and 1830, he had been quickly eclipsed on methods of proof by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) of the young Gauss.

Paris, 1830 Analysis; equations; heat theory Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt (1798–1801), important enough for the First Consulto make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s. There after, Fourier moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himselfto the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.The prefectureship involved heavy commitments, and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless, between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid bodies; his “diffusion equation” for this purpose wasnot only novel in itself but also marked the first largescale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These series were already known but had a low status. Fourier (re)found many properties: not only the formulas for their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how a periodic series could represent a general function.

fifteen, when the duke paid for his further education, lifting him out of near poverty. For the rest of his life Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun. Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the original observations, using the method of least squares, which he had invented but not published, to predict where Ceres would reappear. Gauss then assisted formany years in the analysis of the orbits of several more asteroids. He also wrote extensively on celestial mechanics and cartography, and did important workon telegraphy. will always be remembered. In 1801 he published his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss, the book that created modern algebraic number theory. In it he gave the first rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), going on to find seven more proofs over theyears. Later he extended the theorem to higher powers, introducing the Gaussian integers for the purpose in 1831 (Gaussian integers are numbers of the formm + ni, where m and n are integers and i = \sqrt{-1}). He did major work on differential equations, chiefly the hypergeometric equation, which is a second-order linear differential equation depending on three parameters and having two singular points, with the prop-erty that many of the familiar functions of analysis are related to its solutions. He showed that this equation played a significant role in the new theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), but because most of this work was unpublished it had no influence on the dramatic and rapidly advancing publications of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and jacobiwas the first mathematician to see the need to create[VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). This unpublished work showed that he a theory of complex functions of a complex variable. He also gave four proofs oforem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra).

b. Pithiviers, France, 1781; d. Paris, 1840 Analysis; mechanics; mathematical physics; probability A brilliant graduate of the École Polytechnique in 1800, Poisson was quickly appointed to the staff, and became professor and graduation examiner there until hisdeath. He was also founder professor of mechanics at the new Paris Faculté des Sciences of the Universitéde France; from 1830 he was also a member of the governing Council of the Université.Poisson’s research output was dominated by his adherence to the traditions established by[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827). Like Lagrange he pre-lagrange ferred to algebraize theories, and to rely if possible upon power series and variational methods. From the mid 1810 s he challenged the new theories of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (especially the solving of differential equationsby trigonometric series and the Fourier integral) and ofanalysis using limits, and his innovation of complex-cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) (the new approach to real-variable variable analysis). His overall achievements were muchless significant than theirs: the main novelties were the “Poisson integral,” which embedded Fourier series within a power series; and a summation formula. He also studied the general and singular solutions of differential, difference, and mixed equations. that all physical phenomena were molecular, and thatthe cumulative action upon a molecule of all its com-In physics Poisson tried to justify Laplace’s claim panions should be expressed mathematically in termsof an integral. He applied this approach to heat diffusion and to elasticity theory by the mid 1820 s, butthen decided that integrals should be replaced by sums; he elaborated this alternative especially in capillary theory (1831). Curiously, molecularism did not dominate his most important contributions to physics: to electrostatics (1812–14) and to magnetic bodies and the process of magnetization (1824–27). His mathemat-ical contributions to these topics included modifying Laplace’s equation to what we now call Poisson’s equa-tion, which deals with the potential at points inside a charged body or region of charge (1814); and also adivergence theorem (1826).

Lagrange developed the brackets theory (named afterthem) of canonical solutions to the equations of mo-In mechanics, between 1808 and 1810 Poisson and tion. Poisson’s motivation was to extend, to second-order terms in masses of the planets, Lagrange’s superb attempt to prove that the planetary system was sta-ble; in later work he examined this (first-order) problem specifically, as well as other aspects of perturbation theory. He also analyzed rotating bodies by using moving frames of reference (1839), in an analysis that was to inspire Léon Foucault to propose his famous long pendulum in 1851. His best-known publications include a substantial and wide-ranging two-volume Traité de Mécanique (editions in 1811 and 1833), which did not, however, have room for Louis Poinsot’s beau-tiful recent theory (1803) of the couple in statics. In the mid 1810 s, he studied deep-body fluid dynamics, in rivalry with Cauchy. Poisson was one of the few contemporaries to take up Laplace’s work in probability theory and mathe-matical statistics. He studied various probability distributions(1837, rather in passing) but also the so-called Cauchy[III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions): not only the one named after him (1824) and Rayleigh (1830) distributions. He also examined proofs of theand formulated the law of large numbers central limit theorem [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions),[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) (his term). One of his main applications was to the old problem of determining the probability that a triad of judges would come to the correct decision in court cases (1837).

The value(nonempty) set of numbers with the property not-u in this formulation is a lower bound for the M. Bolzano’s lemma is therefore equivalent to what nowadays might be called the “greatest lower bound” axiom(or, more commonly and equivalently, the “least upper bound” axiom). It is also equivalent to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (that every bounded infinite set in R, or more generally Rn, has an accumulation point).

He showed in this way how points can be described by a homogeneous triple of coordin-ates, lines can be described by linear equations, the concept of cross-ratio can be introduced, and the dualityof points and lines in the plane can be handled algebraically. He also introduced a Möbius net, which is the projective equivalent of squared paper in cartesian geometry. His work is all the more remarkable because Möbius knew very little of Poncelet’s radical reinven-tion of projective geometry only a few years before. In its turn his work was for a time overshadowed by Jakob Steiner’s synthetic treatment of projective geometry of 1832, and then Plücker’s two books on algebraic curves in the 1830 s, but the simplicity and generality of Möbius’s methods were important in establishing projective geometry as a rigorous mainstream subject. In the 1830 s Möbius developed a geometrical theory of statics and the composition of forces, and it was inthis connection that he showed that whereas duality in plane geometry necessarily gives rise to a conic, duality in space need not. Möbius’s study of duality in space, which pairs points with planes, led him to consider the set of all lines in space, which is a four-dimensional space. It pleased the educator Rudolf Steiner very much that the ordinary three-dimensional space may also be thought of as a four-dimensional space, because Steiner’s philosophy was directed against breaking what he saw as a stranglehold of orthodox teaching.

The university had just appointed Martin Bartels as Professor of Mathematics, and Bar-tels not only trained Lobachevskii well, but protected him from trouble with the authorities when Lobachev-skii was suspected of atheism. Eventually, Lobachevskii graduated not with the ordinary degree but with a Master’s qualification, and his career as a professional mathematician began.In 1826, after a reform of the university, Lobachevskii gave a public lecture: “On the principles of geom-etry, with a rigorous demonstration of the theory of parallels.” The manuscript of this talk is now lost, butit probably marked the start of Lobachevskii’s awareness of a non-Euclidean geometry.

Loba-chevskii called these the parallels to the given line through the given point. Starting from this definition, he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles, and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the triangles are very small. He extended his results todescribe a geometry of three dimensions, thus making it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to measure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account of space than Euclidean geometry.He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-gradskii, a much better known mathematician in Saint Petersburg.

From). \text{Almost all of Abel}’s \text{mathematical work was pub}1826 \text{until his death in} 1829 \text{Abel eked out a poor existence}, \text{earning a little by teaching}, \text{but using whatfew resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother}. \text{He died of consumption at the ageof twenty}-\text{seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin}.Abel’s \text{main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas}. \text{The first of these was the theory of equa} - tions. \text{Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange} [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) in 1770 \text{and cauchy} [VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) in 1815 \text{about the form of functions of the roots of an equa} - tion, \text{and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted}. \text{Lagrange had hinted at the possi}-\text{bility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between} 1799 and 1814 \text{trying to provethis}, \text{though he had not managed to persuade his} \text{contemporaries}. Abel’s \text{first success was to give an accept}-\text{able proof of the fact that}, \text{for polynomial equations of degree} 5, \text{there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution}. \text{This first appeared in} 1824 \text{in a short pamphlet writtenin French and published privately in Christiania} (Oslo). \text{Once Abel reached Berlin}, however, \text{Crelle translated itinto German and published it in the first volume of his journal}; \text{he also published a fuller}, \text{more detailed account}, \text{covering polynomials of any degree greater than} 4, in 1826.\text{Abel returned to equations a few years later}, \text{publishing a long paper in} 1829 \text{about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions}. \text{His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as afunction of every other root}, \text{the second that these functions commute} (\text{in modern terms}, the[V.21](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - quintic) \text{of the equation is commutative}). \text{He proved var}-\text{galois group ious theorems about such equations}, \text{the most striking} 761 \text{being that they are soluble by radicals}. \text{This represented an extensive} \text{generalization} \text{of the ideas described by gauss met ic ae}[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) \text{in the seventh part of}, \text{where the special case of cyclotomic equations} \text{Disquisitiones} Arith(\text{which satisfy both of these conditions}) \text{is treated sys} - tematically. \text{It was in honour of this work that}, later, \text{the adjective} “Abelian” \text{was applied to groups that are commutative}. \text{It is important to appreciate}, however, \text{that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations without any appeal to groups}, \text{which at that time werenot yet known}. convergence. \text{Although there had been over a centuryof critical thinking devoted to foundations of the cal}-\text{He also made major contributions to the theory of culus}, \text{modern ideas of rigour were only just emerg}-\text{ing in the writings of bolzano} [VI.28](/part - 06/bernard - bolzano - 17811848), Cauchy, \text{and others}. \text{Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy}’s \text{lectures of} 1820–21, \text{but series in general}, \text{and power series in particular}, \text{were still far from well understood}. \text{Among other contributions}, \text{Abel offereda proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers}, \text{and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel}’s \text{limit theorem}.\text{Perhaps his greatest discoveries}, however, \text{were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together}. \text{To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words}: first, \text{a new and productive approach to the theory ofa vast} \text{generalization} \text{of elliptic functions to what are elliptic functions} [V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem); and, second, \text{now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals}. \text{Inthis area Abel competed for priority with jacobi} [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851). Most (\text{though by no means all}) \text{of his work was written in two memoirs}. \text{One was published in two parts},“\text{Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques}” and “Précis d’\text{une th}é\text{orie des fonctions elliptiques},” \text{coming to wellover two hundred pages in Crelle}’s \text{Journal in} 1828 and 1829. \text{The other}, entitled “Mé\text{moire sur une propri}été générale d’\text{une classe tr}ès é\text{tendue de fonctions tran} - scendantes,” \text{was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October} 1826. \text{There it lay on Cauchy}’s desk, \text{unread until after Abel}’s death. \text{It was published by the Paris Academy in} 1841. \text{The manuscript itself}, however, \text{was stolen by} G.

many prime numbers. In two subsequent papers, pub-lished in 1838 and 1839, he used his new methods, among other things, to determine the formula of the class number of binary quadratic forms: that is, thenumber of proper classes of forms of given determinant. It is often said that these three papers mark thestart of analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Dirichlet also made important contributions to algebraic number theory, culminating in hisrem [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) for the Abelian group of units in an alge-unit theobraic number field. These contributions, together with numerous others due to him (e.g., his Sc hu bf a ch pr inz ip, or box principle; work on the law of biquadratic reciprocity; and results concerning Gaussian sums), were brought together in his influential Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie by his former student(lectures on number theory), \text{published dedekind} [VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in 1863. \text{Inspired by his close contact with fourier} [VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) \text{during his student days in Paris}, Dirichlet’s \text{other main interests were in analysis and mathematical physics}, \text{and in the connections between them}. \text{In a ground}-\text{breaking paper of} 1829, \text{Dirichlet not only gave the first strict proof of the convergence of a Fourier series under given conditions}, \text{but he also used new methods and concepts} (e.g., \text{his insight into the importance of conditional convergence of series}; \text{his Dirichlet function influencing the development of the concept of a function}) \text{that became classic and that served as a basis for countless nineteenth} - century \text{investigations} \text{on analy} - sis. \text{He also occupied himself with the determination of multiple integrals as well as with the expansion ofa function into spherical functions} (\text{Kugelfunktionen}) \text{and applied these results to problems in mathematical physics}. \text{His main contributions to mathematical physics include papers on the theory of heat}, hydrodynamics, \text{the gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid}, the$n$-\text{body problem}, \text{and potential theory}. \text{The first boundary}-\text{value problem} (the “\text{Dirichlet problem}” \text{of finding the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region}) \text{had already been handled by Fourier and others}, \text{but Dirichlet proved the uniqueness of the solution}, \text{while the dirichlet principle ing boundary problems for}[IV.12 §3.5](/part - 04/analysis) (\text{a method for solv}-\text{elliptic partial differential equations ational problems}[IV.12 §2.5](/part - 04/analysis) \text{by reducing them to}[III.94](/part - 03/variational - methods)) \text{was introduced by him in var i lectures on potential theory}, \text{enhancing a method introduced by Gauss}. \text{Connected with Dirichlet}’s \text{work onanalysis was his contribution to probability and error VI}.38. \text{Augustus De Morgan theory}, \text{in particular his development of new methods for probabilistic limit theorems}. \text{mathematics by his mathematical style}, \text{by the exact}-\text{Dirichlet also influenced the further development of ness and elegance of his proofs}, \text{and by his teaching}.\text{Together with his friend jacobi} [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851), \text{he ushered in a new epoch of mathematical teaching at german universities by introducing lectures and seminars on the most recent research}, \text{and with him began thegolden age of mathematics in Berlin}. \text{Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school}, \text{his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind}, Eisen - stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), \text{and riemann} [VI.49], \text{among others}. \text{Further Reading Butzer}, P.-L., M.

In July 1829, after his father’s sui-cide, Galois was again rejected by the École Polytechnique. He entered the École Préparatoire (later known asthe École Normale Supérieure) in October 1829 but was expelled in December 1830 for unacceptable behaviour arising from political disagreements with the authori-ties. Arrested on Bastille Day (14 July) 1831, he spent the next eight months in prison for flouting authority again. He emerged at the end of April 1832 but somehow got himself challenged to a duel. On 29 May he edited his manuscripts and wrote a summary of his dis-coveries in a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The duel took place the next morning and he died on 31 May1832. Much has been written about him. But a man who dies so young leaves little real evidence for historians to work with, however rich his story, and most of his biographers have allowed romantic invention to colour their accounts of his life. cal works (and a number of smaller and less important There are four main papers in Galois’s mathemat i items). The first to be published was “Sur la théorie des nombres,” which appeared in April 1830 and contains the theory of Galois fields. These are analogues of the complex numbers obtained by adjoining to the integers modulo a prime numberp a root of an irreducible poly- nomial congruence moduloof the basic features of what later became the theory ofp. The paper contains most finite fields.In the letter to Chevalier written on the eve of the duel, Galois mentions three memoirs. The first, now known as thetled “Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations Premier Mémoire, is a manuscript entipar radicaux.” Galois submitted work on the theory ofequations to the Paris Academy on 25 May and 1 June 1829, but this is now lost and it seems quite possible that Galois withdrew it on the advice of Cauchy (towhom it had been given to referee) in January 1830. In February 1830 he resubmitted his work in compe-tition for the Grand Prix de Mathématiques, but his manuscript was unfortunately and mysteriously loston the death of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (and the prize was awarded jointly tojacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851)).

His ideas led directly to “abstract algebra” (see [II.3 §6](/part-02/abstract-algebra-development)): when the abstract notion of field developed later in the nineteenth century, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fieldshad already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois theory developed directly out of the material in the Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed from the ideas in the Mémoire together with a series of papers published by Premier Mémoire and the Second Cauchy in 1845.

compete for positions at England’s Anglican universi-ties. This effectively forced him down a convoluted path toward his personal goal of a career as a research mathematician. He worked as an actuary in London in the1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by passing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some sixyears in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-ics, in England and in the United States. Most notably, Sylvester served as the first Professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold professorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health forced his retirement in 1894. The program sylvester set up at Johns Hopkins established his pivotal place in the history of American research-level mathematics, while his mathematical accomplishments had garnered him an international reputation as early as the 1860 s. with work on the problem of determining when two polynomial equations have a common root. This nat-Sylvester entered the research arena in the late 1830 s urally led not only to questions in the theory of determinants but also to an explicit, pioneering, and self-consciously algebraic analysis of the intermediate expressions that arise in Charles François Sturm’s algorithm for determining the number of real roots of a polynomial equation that lie between two given real numbers (1839, 1840). Sylvester followed this up with what he called the dialytic method of elimination: a new criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detecting whether two polynomial equations have a common root (1841).His next major research push came in the 1850 s when, together with theory of invariants. This involved an associated andcayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More concretely, given a binary form of a particular degree, Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for explicitly finding invariants and covariants of that formand for determining algebraic relations, or “syzygies,” between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two important papers: “On the principles of the calculus offorms” (1852) and “On a theory of the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions” (1853). In thelatter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law of inertia: if$Q(x^{1}$, . . . , xn) is a real quadratic form [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rankr , then there exists a (real) nonsingular

However, he then entered a fallow period that ended only with his move to Baltimore. While there, he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the problem of inductively determining, for binary forms first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4, etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generating set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordanhad proved that this number is always finite and, in so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley, who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, thebinary form of degree 5) was infinite. By 1879, Sylvester had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly independent covariants associated with a binary form of any given degree.Sylvester was the founding editor of the American Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80), and on matrix algebras (1884), appeared there.

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested inbuilding telescopes and scientific instruments than making shoes—the result being that his business failed and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen and take a job as a junior teacher to support his parents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and together they built functioning scientific instruments. Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age oftwenty he was publishing original research in calculus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to others such asto develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded thecayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on operators in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-ics to be presented by the society. The paper was important not only because it contained (arguably forthe first time) a clear definition of the concept of an operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as differentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as anobject in its own right. There was an explicit similarity between the laws he derived for functions of D and the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss below. man but family circumstances prevented this.

In sim-ple cases, his approach also reduces classical logic to symbolic mathematical form. Using the symbols 0 and1 to denote “nothing” and “universe” respectively, and denoting the complement of the class x by 1 - x, he derived (from the law of duality) the law$x(1 - x) = 0$, which represents the impossibility of an object simul-taneously possessing and not possessing a given property, otherwise known as the principle of contradic-tion. Boole also applied his calculus to the theory of probability. Boole’s algebra lay dormant until 1939, when Shannon discovered that it was the appropriate language for describing digital switching circuits. Boole’s work thus became an essential tool in the modern development of electronics and digital computer technology. ematics: differential equations, difference equations, Boole also made several other contributions to math operator theory, calculus of integrals, etc. His text-books on differential equations (1859) and finite differences (1860) include much of his original research and are still in print today, but he is best remembered as the father of symbolic logic and one of the foundersof computer science.

VI.44 Karl Weierstrass

b. Ostenfelde, Germany, 1815; d. Berlin, 1897 Analysis Weierstrass began his career studying finance and administration at the University of Bonn but his real interest was mathematics and he did not complete his course. He qualified as a teacher and taught in gym-nasia for fourteen years. The turning point in his life occurred when, at the age of almost forty, he publisheda ground-breaking paper on Abelian functions, in which he solved the problem of inversion of hyperelliptic inte-grals. Shortly afterward he was offered a position at the University of Berlin. He demanded of himself the very strictest standards, with the result that he published little. His ideas, and his reputation, spread through his excellent lectures, which drew students and established mathematicians from around the world.Weierstrass has been described as the “father of modern analysis.” He contributed to all branches of the subject: calculus, differential and integral equa-tions, the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), infinite series, elliptic and Abelian functions, and real and com-plex analysis. His work is characterized by attention to foundations and by scrupulous logical reasoning.“Weierstrass i an rigor” has come to denote rigor of the strictest standard. was heuristic, lacking logical foundations.

Butcauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) there were several major foundational problems withhis approach: verbal definitions of limit and continuity; frequent use of infinitesimals; and intuitive appealto geometry in proving the existence of various limits. Weierstrass and dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) (among others) determined to remedy this unsatisfactory situation, and set themselves the goal of establishing theorems in a “purely arithmetic” manner, as Dedekind put it.To that end, Weierstrass gave preciseε–δdefinitions ofwe still use today), thus banishing infinitesimals fromlimit [I.3 §5.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and continuity [I.3 §5.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) (those

He also defined the real numbers based on the robinson [VI.95](/part-06/abraham-robinson-19181974) some hundred years rationals (although Dedekind’s and cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) approaches proved more accessible). He was thereby largely responsible for the “arithmetization of analysis” (a term coined byable contributions to real analysis are his introduction klein [VI.57]). Among his remarkof uniform convergence (introduced independently by P. L.

Both riemann [VI.49] and Weierstrass (succeeding Cauchy) founded complex function theory, but theyhad fundamentally different approaches to the subject. Riemann’s global, geometric conception was based onthe notion of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and on the dirichlet principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis), while Weierstrass’s local algebraic theory was grounded in power seriesand analytic continuation [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). “\text{The more} I \text{ponder the principles of function theory}—and I \text{do so incessantly}—\text{the more} I \text{am convinced that it must be founded on simple algebraic truths}. . .,” \text{he asserted in a letter to} H.

This was mostly pure mathe-matics. He generalized permutation groups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) using the calculus of operations as a basis, and hesaw that not only were matrices useful as a notational device, but they also constituted a study in their ownright. Not generally an excitable person, at the point of discovery he declared theas “very remarkable” and generations of mathemati-Cayley–Hamilton theorem cians have shared his delight. Matrix algebra was usedin his solution of the Cayley–Hermite problem, which required a description of those linear transformations that leave a bilinear form invariant. A special case of the solution gives rise to the(I - T )(I + T )-1. The links between quaternions, matri-Cayley orthogonal transform ces, and group theory that he observed in the 1850 sare indicative of his concern for the organization of mathematics.

He discovered Cayley’s formula for the general form of covariants of binary forms and counting them.

In astronomy he contributed to the theory of ellipan assiduous attention to detail. His work on the lunar theory was noteworthy, and in one long calculation he helped to settle an Anglo-French controversy by veri-fying the correct value for the secular acceleration of the Moon, which had been established by John Couch Adams in 1853. Cayley returned to the academic world in 1863 as the founding Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathemat-ics at Cambridge. In 1868 Paul Gordan startled invariant theorists by proving that invariants and covariants of a binary quantic could be expressed in terms of a finiteley’s but, undaunted, he completed his series with a list-basis. This contradicted an earlier result of Caying of the irreducible invariants and covariants of thebinary form of order 5 (the binary quintic), and their connecting syzygies. Many developments in pure mathematics can be traced back to his minor notes of the 1870 s and 1880 s, including the theory of knots, fractals, dynamic programming, and group theory (the well-knownley’s theorem). In graph theory, the number of dis-Caytinct labeled trees withn \text{nodes being} (nn)-2 \text{is known} as Cayley’s graph theorem. He brought his theoretical knowledge of graphical trees to bear on the prob-lem of counting isomers in organic chemistry, thus prompting questions about the actual existence of cer-tain chemical compounds that have since been discovered in many instances by chemists. In the last decade of his life, Cayley set about the task that gavehim an important line of contact with today’s mathematicians: the publication of hisical Papers in thirteen large volumes by Cambridge Collected Mathemat University Press.

VI.47 Charles Hermite

b. Dieuze, Moselle, France, 1822; d. Paris, 1901 Analysis (elliptic functions, differential equations); algebra (invariant theory, quadratic forms); approximation theory Like many who aspired to enter the École Polytech-nique, Hermite undertook special preparatory classes, in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand.He began to study serious mathematics, immersing himself in the work ofdre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution oflagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen equations by radicals. Admitted to the École Polytechnique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed his first significant original work. This extended results of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very positively. This achievement both brought him recognition in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobion elliptic functions and number theory that launched Hermite’s career. commensurate with his abilities, and for almost adecade survived on teaching assistant and examiner Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms, where he followed ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study transformation. It was in this context that thetian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) named after him arose. Her-hermimite was interested in invariants of quadratic forms, and also applied his work to the problem of locationof roots of polynomials. As a result of these efforts, in 1856 he was appointed to the Paris Academy of Sciences, with port ing him. This appointment was quickly followed liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) supby Hermite’s 1858 discovery of a means to express the solutions of the general fifth-degree polynomial equa-tion in terms of elliptic functions, which earned him widespread international recognition. ence in Paris in 1869, Hermite became an influential Finally obtaining a professorship at the Faculty of Scimentor for a generation of mathematicians, his best-known protégés including J.

E. Picard, P. Appell, and E. Goursat. Hermite’s dynas-tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law, Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-ried borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956). His advocacy of improved international communication led to German work becoming much better known in France than it had been previously. During this period, he obtained a proof ofthe transcendence [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) of “e” using continued fraction approximation theory (which had included the inven-[III.22] methods based on earlier research in tion of the Hermite polynomials). His influence in the mathematical community was strong until his death.

These activities left him wealthy and free to return to Berlin and concentrate on mathematics without holding an academic position. In 1855, Kronecker’s former school teacher and closest scientific friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861, Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin University. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897)) highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about Kronecker. After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kronecker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his teaching activities as well as the frequency of his publications. This last active period was cut short when hedied, shortly after the death of his wife.

In 1868, he was Kronecker was renowned for the originality of his offered the chair at Göttingen formerly held by[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and was elected to the Paris Academy. After thegauss Franco-Prussian war of 1870–71, he was invited to rec-ommend mathematicians for the newly opened German university in Strasbourg; and in 1880 he became the managing editor of thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange-Crelle’s Journal li shed, or in com pre he ns i ble proofs—). He was often criticized for incomplete, unpub-jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) spoke of his colleagues’ “envy and despair” with regard to his results. Only in his later years was he explicit about his constructivist methodology. This constituted at least part of the quarrel with Weierstrass, and later prompted hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) to call Kronecker a “Verbotsdiktator” (“forbidding dictator”). Generally affable and hospitable, Kronecker was tough in defending his mathematical ideas and his claims to priority. (in the early 1850 s), he claimed not only the so-called In his first works on solvable algebraic equations Kronecker–Weber theorem (in today’s formulation: every finite Galois extension of the rational num-bers with Abelian galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) lies in a field generated by roots of unity; the first correct proof of itwas given by Hilbert in 1896), but also a generalization to Abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields, which he later called his “liebster Jugendtraum” (“dear-est dream of his youth”). This dream, which was incorrectly translated by Hilbert into his twelfth problem in1900, is today part of class field theory [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871) and the theory of complex multiplication. Such connections between algebra, analysis, and arithmetic continuedto pervade Kronecker’s later work. Important results of Kronecker include class number relations and limit formulas in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, and a theory of bilinear forms. braic number theory, but only in 1881 did he pub-lish his “Grundzüge einer arithmetischen Theorie der In the late 1850 s, Kronecker began to work on al ge algebraischen Grössen,” dedicated to Kummer on the fiftieth anniversary of his doctorate. This mathematical testament contains an (incomplete) exposition of a unified arithmetical theory of algebraic numbers and alge-braic functions. As a research program, it adumbrates important aspects of class field theory as well as ofan arithmetico-geometric theory in dimensions higher than one. Kronecker’s concept of “divisor” is equivalent

For this, he propagated the introduction of indeterminates and equiv-alence relations, a method which he traced back to Gauss. In the case of a finite extension of the rational numbers, for instance, Kronecker is explicitly working with polynomials modulo an irreducible equationf (x) = 0, rather than adjoining a root of it.

Selasca, Italy, 1866 Real and complex analysis; differential equations; differential geometry; heat distribution; number theory; propagation of shock waves; topology Riemann was born into a poor pastor’s family and stud-ied mathematics at Göttingen, eventually becoming a professor there. His health broke in 1862 and he diednear Lake Maggiore, Italy, of pleurisy at the age of thirty-nine.No mathematician is more associated with the midnineteenth-century transition from algorithmic to con-ceptual thought than Riemann. His doctoral thesis of 1851, and still more his paper on Abelian functions(1857), promoted the view that a holomorphic function riemann equations[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) is properly defined by the[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and is to be studied cauchy through a close connection with the theory of harmonic functionsa proof of the remarkable[IV.24 §5.1](/part-04/stochastic-processes).

This states that ifconnected open subsets in the complex plane, neither X and Y are any two simply of which is the whole plane, then there is a holomorphic map from one to the other with a holomorphic inverse.

(The in algebraic geometry as well as complex analysis, determines the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions on a given Riemann surface with a pre-scribed number of poles.) In 1857 he extended the theory of differential equations, specifically the impor-tant case of the hypergeometric equation, to complex functions. In 1859 he used deep, new ideas from complex function theory to study the (Riemann) zeta func-tion and proposed his celebrated conjecture, the riemann hypothesis of the complex zeros of this function. The conjecture[IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), concerning the location remains unsolved to this day. These ideas enabled mathematicians to study complex functions on domains other than the plane and subsets of the plane. They opened the way to a geometric study of algebraic functions and algebraic curves, and proved to be decisive in the study of the integrals of algebraic functions (the theories of Abelian functions and theta functions of several variables). Investigations of the Riemann zeta function led not only to the discovery of new properties of classes of complex func-

This left open the questions of what sorts of functions did not satisfy these conditions and how could they be studied. Riemann reformulated the concept of the integral and wasable to show that it is not just the continuity of a function and the ways in which it may fail to be continuous that affect the accuracy of its Fourier series representation, but the nature of its oscillations. The riemann integral remained the dominant definition of the integral until it was replaced by the lebesgue integral [III.55](/part-03/measures) after 1902, which is better adapted to capturing the way the behavior of a function affects its Fourier series.In a lecture, also given in 1854 (but published posthumously in 1868), he entirely reformulated geometry asbeing about spaces (sets of points, which he called manifolds(an appropriate concept of distance) and argued that[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) with a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) the geometric properties of a space were its intrinsic ones. He noted that there are three constant-curvature spaces in two dimensions and showed how the idea ofconstant curvature can be extended to higher dimensions. In passing, he was the first person to write down ametric for non-Euclidean geometry (more than a decade before Beltrami’s publication of 1868, which legitimized non-Euclidean geometry).

b. Brunswick, Germany, 1831; d. Brunswick, Germany, 1916 Algebraic number theory; algebraic curves; set theory; foundations of mathematics Dedekind spent most of his life as a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Brunswick, Germany (his andgauss’s [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) home town), having spent the years 1858–62 at the Polytechnikum in Zürich (which later became known as ETH).

Dedekind was a retiring man dirichlet [VI.36] with, ashe remained a bachelor, living with his mother andklein [VI.57] said, a “contemplative nature;” sister.

Indeed, he shaped mod-[I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). His main contribution, however, was ern number theory as we know it, presenting it as atheory of ideals in rings of integers (see algebraic numbers [[IV.1 §§4–7]](/part-04/algebraic-numbers)). This was first made public in 1871, within Supplement X to his edition of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, where he established unique decomposition of ideals into prime ideals for all rings of algebraic integers. In the process, he for-mulated the concepts of field, ring, ideal, and module (see [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)), always within the par-ticular context of the complex numbers. It was also in the context of algebra (Galois theory) and num-ber theory that Dedekind started systematic work with

This work paved the way for riemann modern algebraic geometry. and number theory were his reflections on the foun-Intimately linked with Dedekind’s work in algebra dations of the real number system. In 1858 (published1872) he formulated a definition of the real numbers using what are now known as “Dedekind cuts” in the set of rational numbers. During the 1870 s (published1888) he elaborated a purely set-theoretic definition of the natural numbers as “simply infinite” sets, whichled him to crystallize the dedekind–peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms). In this work, as in his more advanced research, sets, structures, and mappings form the essential building blocks, the very foundations of pure mathematics.In the light of (now superseded) conceptions of logic, this led Dedekind to the view that “arithmetic (algebra, analysis) is only a part of logic.” From a modern viewpoint, his contributions show that set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) is a sufficient foundation for classical mathematics.Thus he contributed as much as anybody else to the set-theoretic reformulation of modern mathematics.

Cantor was able to establish much more generalf in gen- results, and in five papers written between 1870 and 1872 he was able to show that such representations were unique even if an infinite number of exceptional points were allowed, so long as these exceptional points (i.e., points at which the function failed to be continu-ous) were distributed over the domain of the function’s definition in a particular way, constituting what Cantor called “point sets of the first species.” His studies ofthese and related point sets eventually led Cantor to his much more abstract and powerful theory of sets and transfinite numbers.

It was Cantor’s subsequent study(n + 1)\text{st derived set was} of infinite linear point sets that would eventually lead tohis creation of transfinite set theory in the 1880 s. (For more details about this, see Before he did so, Cantor first began to explore theset theory [IV.22 §2](/part-04/set-theory).) implications of his work on trigonometric series andthe structure of the real numbers in several papers, one of which was to revolutionize mathematics in a fundamental way. The first of these papers was pub-lished in 1874, and bore the innocuous title “Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen” (“On a property of the collection of all real algebraic numbers”). In this paper, Cantor proved that the set of all algebraic real numbers wasnite [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets). What was revolutionary about the paper, countably infihowever, was that he also proved that the set of all real numbers was not countable, and must be of a higher order of infinity than the countably infinite set of natural numbers. He returned to this result in 1891 witha new approach, the groundbreaking method of diagonalization, to prove in a very direct way that the set ofreal numbers is uncountably infinite. Cantor’s second important paper of the decade appeared in 1878, “Ein Beitrag zur mannigfaltigkei tslehre” (“A contribution tothe theory of aggregates”), \text{in which he proved} (\text{with a partly faulty argument}) \text{the invariance of dimension}, \text{a theorem first correctly proved by brouwer} [VI.75](/part - 06/luitzen - egbertus - jan - brouwer - 18811966) in 1911. \text{designed to outline the basic elements of his new think}-\text{ing about sets}. \text{He first considered what happened if a Between} 1879 and 1884 \text{Cantor published six papers set were not of the first species by introducing sym}-\text{bols for the infinite indices needed to identify such sets}. \text{For example}, \text{a setond species if there was no finite} P \text{was said to be of then such that the nsec}-\text{th derived set Pn of Pwas finite}. \text{He then considered the case in which the intersection of all the derived sets of} P (namely P^, P^ , . . . , Pn, . . .) was again an infinite set, which he designated had a derived set as well, P \infty. This set, since it was infinite,$P^$\infty$+1$, and this led in fact to an entire sequence of derived sets of the second species:$P \i\text{nf ty}$, P$\i\text{nf ty}$+1, $. . . , P^$\infty$+n$, . . . , P2 \i\text{nf ty}, . . . . In his first papers on infinite linear sets, these indices for derived sets remained “infinitary symbols”: that is, devices for distinguishing between different sets. But

779

in hislehre (“Foundations of a general set theory”), published Grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannigfaltigkei tsin 1883, these symbols became the first transfinite numbers: the transfinite ordinal numbers. These numbers began with re sent ing the sequence of natural numbers 1ω, the transfinite ordinal number rep-, 2, 3, . . . , which could also be thought of as the first infinite ordinal number after all of the finite whole numbers. In the Grundlagen, Cantor not only devised the basic features of a transfinite arithmetic for these numbers, but he provided a detailed philosophical defense of the new numbers. Acknowledging the revolutionary nature of what he was introducing, he argued that the new concepts were necessary in order to achieve precise mathematical results that he could obtain by noother means. ever, the transfinite cardinal numbers, which he de-noted using the Hebrew letter aleph, were introduced Cantor’s best-known mathematical creation, howonly later, in the 1890 s. They were first given full expo-sition in a pair of papers (1895, 1897) that constituted his “Beiträge zur Begrundung der transfiniten Mengen-lehre” (“Contributions to the founding of transfinite set theory”). In two articles published in Mathematische annalen ordinal and cardinal numbers, as well as their arith-, he not only set out his theory of transfinite metics, but also explained his theory of order types, namely the different properties exhibited by the sets of natural, rational, and real numbers considered in their natural orders. There he also stated (but could notprove) his famous continuum hypothesis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), namely that the power (or cardinal number) of the con-tinuum of all real numbers R is the next largest infinite set (or cardinal number) after the countably infi-nite set of natural numbers N, the cardinality of which was taken to be hypothesis algebraically as the statement that 2א0. \text{Cantor expressed the continuum}א0 = א . orary degrees from foreign universities and the Cop-ley Medal of the Royal Society for his great contribu-By the end of his career Cantor had received hon-1 tions to mathematics, but there were problems withset theory that were beyond his capacities to remedy. The most disturbing for many mathematicians were the“antinomies” of set theory: the paradoxes put forward by the likes of Burali-Forti andthe former published the paradox arising from the col-russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970).

that are not members of themselves: is it a member ofitself or not? (See the crisis in the foundations of mathematics [II.7 §2.1](/part-02/foundations-crisis).) Cantor himself was aware of the contradictions that arose from considering the col-lections of all transfinite ordinal or cardinal numbers, and what their ordinal or cardinal numbers might be.The solution Cantor adopted was to regard such collections as too large, and not really sets at all, but “in consistent aggregates” as he called them. Others, like Zer-melo, began to axiomatize set theory in an effort to exclude the possibility of contradictions. The two most powerful results of the twentieth century to complement Cantor’s work are those of gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) (who established the consistency of the continuum hypoth-esis with zermelo–fraenkel set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory)) and Paul Cohen (who determined the independence ofthe continuum hypothesis from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), the latter finally establishing the impossibility of proving the continuum hypothesis. truly been revolutionary. Above all, his transfinite settheory for the first time gave mathematicians the Cantor’s legacy for the history of mathematics has means of dealing with concepts of the infinite in acareful and precise way.

also came second in the more demanding Smith’s prize examination. In 1868 he became a Fellow of Trinity, leaving in 1871 to become the professor of applied mathematics at University College London. He died of tuberculosis in 1879. A versatile mathematician, regarded by many as the best of his generation, Clifford’s favorite field was geometry, over which he ranged widely, proving new results in classical Euclidean geometry as well as in projective and differential geometry. He was the first English mathematician to appreciate the work of riemann [VI.49] on differential geometry, and published a translation of Riemann’s paper “On the hypothe-ses that lie at the foundations of geometry” in 1873. He endorsed Riemann’s fundamental reformulation of geometry, and went even further in speculating that the curvature of physical space might explain the motion of matter. He also made a significant application of thethe first to analyze the complicated topological nature riemann–roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), and was among of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) by showing how to dissect any Riemann surface into simple pieces in a stan-dard way. He was the first to study a geometry locally equivalent to plane geometry but topologically distinct(the flat torus, also known today as the Clifford–Klein space form after klein’s [VI.57] later more detailed study of it). In algebra, he invented the biquaternions(these are like quaternions, but have complex numbers as coefficients). Clifford was regarded as a marvelous lecturer until his health broke, and he was a successful popularizer and essay writer. He forcefully adopted the view that geometry was a matter of experience, not a priori truth. He was a friend of T. H. Huxley and was sympathetic tohumanism in philosophy.

His Ph.D. thesis Frege was trained at Jena and Göttingen, receiving addressed the spatial representation of imaginary ele-ments in geometry, and his 1874 Habilitation essay at Jena worked out some basic details of what we wouldnow call “iteration theory.” Though his early work gave no obvious sign of the revolutionary work to come, with hindsight one can discern a foundational motif running through even the apparently conventional math-ematics of the early work: a conviction that arithmetic was in some way or other logical, and that geometry was fundamentally different and less general because it was grounded in spatial intuition. This is an especially salient concern in some of his areas of early research, such as Plücker’s line geometry and riemann’s [VI.49] complex analysis, where the role of visual represen-tation was a matter of some dispute. Frege sought to resolve the dispute by deriving arithmetic and analy-sis rigorously from logical principles. His motivation was not so much a desire for certainty: rather, heheld that only “gap-free” proofs can reveal a science’s fundamental principles.Among the features of contemporary logic appearing first in Frege’s core logical writings ((1879) and Grundgesetze der Arithmetik Begriffsschrift(volume 1, 1893; volume 2, 1903)) are the following. (i) Inferences are analyzed within a quantified logic of propositions, which extends to relations as wellas to propositions of subject–predicate form. We would today describe Frege’s logical system as ahigher-order predicate calculus. (ii) Forms from syllogistic logic (such as “All As are Bs”) are interpreted as quantified conditionals (“For allx, if x is an A, then xis a B”), in the way that is now so standard as to seem inescapable, presenting implicitly the point that the underlying logical form of a proposition may differ fromits surface grammar. (iii) The syntax of the language is explicitly displayed, and inferences are carried out strictly in accordance with the form of statements by explicitly stated rules. (iv) Rules of inference and axioms are distinguished; the consequence relation and conditionals are distinguished. (v) “Function” is taken as an undefined primitive con-cept. (This was a contentious move. Some math-

It would be several decades before Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and logicians approached Frege’s standards for exactness and clarity. The notation, however, seemed unwieldy to readers at the time (and since). Here, for example, is the statement “if notq, then every v is F”$(¬q =⇒(∀v)F(v))$ in Frege’s notation: v F(v) q (Here represents negation, v is the universal quantifier, and the long vertical line represents the conditional.) arithmetik on English-language philosophy since its translation Frege also wrote an informal treatise,(1884), which has had a profound influence Grundlagen der in 1950. Its account of number contains the first hint ofthe tension that would collapse the project from within. Frege sets out conditions that a definition of number must satisfy to be counted as “acceptable.” However, when formalized these lead to a contradiction, of a similar type to Russell’s paradox (on the set of all sets thatare not members of themselves). This problem escaped Frege’s notice until Russell alerted him to it in a let-ter of 1903. Frege’s reaction (“arithmetic totters”) has been taken to be an over reaction to the failure of one set of axioms among many possible ones. But in Frege’sview, the problem was not with the specific axioms, but rather that any logically adequate weakening appearedto violate some principle he took to be grounded in the nature of thought. Recently, many logicians who do not share Frege’s often baroque-seeming metaphysics of concepts have shown that some natural consistent weakenings of Frege’s system do support the derivation of the mathematics Frege aimed to reconstruct.

After Plücker’s death in 1868 he went to Göttingen to study with Alfred Cleb-sch, where he worked exclusively on mathematics. In 1869–70 he spent some months in Berlin studying with weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) and kummer [VI.40] before joining After passing his habilitation in Göttingen in 1871, lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) for a trip to Paris to see hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901). he took positions successively at Erlangen, Munich, and Leipzig, returning to Göttingen in 1886, where he remained until he retired (because of poor health) in1913. In 1875 he married Anna Hegel, a granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.In 1872 Klein published his celebrated “Erlanger Programm,” a creative and unified conception of geom-etry. Building on a paper of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) of 1859 in which Cayley had shown how to deduceean geometry [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from projective geometry euclid[I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), Klein applied his knowledge of group theory(learned from jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) in Paris) to create a hierarchy of all geometries. He had recognized that each geometry could be characterized by a group of transformations and classified accordingly (seedamental mathematical definitions [I.3 §6.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)). Thesome fun-

classification showed, as Klein had anticipated, that ofall the geometries, projective is the most basic and that the others, e.g., affine, hyperbolic, Euclidean, etc., are subsumed at some level beneath it. Moreover, it was clear from his construction that a contradiction ineuclidean geometry [[II.2 §§6–10]](/part-02/geometry) would simultane-nonously involve a contradiction in Euclidean geometry.Klein regarded his work in function theory as his greatest achievement. As his career progressed, hemoved more and more from Plücker’s and Clebsch’s strictly geometric viewpoint toward the wider out-look embraced by riemann [VI.49], who had regarded analytic functions as given by conformal mappings between given domains. In his “Riemanns Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihrer Integrale” (1882), Klein gave a geometric treatment of function theory in which he fused Riemann’s ideas with the rigorous power-series methods of Weierstrass. Klein’s health broke down. His attempt to keep upwith In 1882, when he was at the height of his powers, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in the race to develop the theory of automorphic functions (which are generalizations of periodic functions such as trigonometric functions, elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), etc.), during which he had proved his famous Grenzkreis (boundary circle) The-orem, had left him exhausted, and he was never again able to work with such intensity and at such a high level.After his breakdown Klein’s interest shifted progressively from research toward pedagogy. In his efforts tomodernize mathematical education he developed outstanding organizational skills and initiated important and far-reaching editorial projects ranging from the preparation of lecture notes to coediting the twentyfour-volumes ch af ten (1896–1935). He was an editor of the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissen-Mathematische Annalen the founding members of the Deutsche Mathematik er-for almost fifty years, and was among Ver einigung (1890). He also played an active role in establishing mathematical applications in science and engineering, as well as promoting the better under-standing of mathematics by engineers. results in the theory of algebraic equations (through Among Klein’s other achievements were important a consider at i on of the icosahedron he obtained a com-plete theory of the general fifth-degree equation (1884)) and in mechanics, in which, jointly with Arnold Som-merfeld, he developed the theory of the gyroscope (1897–1910). He also worked on ideas involving the application of group theory to the theory of relativity, producing papers on the lorentz group [IV.13 §1](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)

(1910) and gravitation (1918). Klein was an interna-tional figure who traveled widely, including to the United States and the United Kingdom, and he playeda significant role in the first International Congresses of Mathematicians. His many foreign students included several from the United States, e.g., Maxime Bôcher and William Fogg Osgood, and a number of women, notably Grace Chisholm Young and Mary Winston. Klein’s achievements made Göttingen the scientific center of Germany and one of the mathematical cen-ters of the world. He possessed an outstanding ability to “see” the truth in mathematical statements and to bring mathematical fields together without feeling the necessity for detailed calculations and justification (which he left to his students and others). He believed strongly in the unity of mathematics.

Berlin, 1917 Analysis; linear algebra; number theory; theory of groups; character theory After school in Berlin, Frobenius (who suppressed hisfirst name and wrote mainly as G. Frobenius) spent one semester studying mathematics and physics in Göttingen, then returned to Berlin where he studied under kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), kummer [VI.40], weierstrass sertation (in Latin) supervised by Weierstrass, in 1870,[VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), and others. He wrote his doctoral dison infinite series representations of analytic func-tions of one variable. For four years he worked as a schoolteacher in Berlin before he became Außerordentlicher Professor (associate professor) at Berlin Uni-versity. After less than two years, in 1875, he was called to a full professorship at the Eidgenössische Technis-che Hochschule in Zürich, where he remained until

Later he wrote mainlyon theta functions, algebra, and number theory. One of His early contributions were to analysis and the his well-known contributions lies across group theoryand number theory. Given a polynomial with coefficients in an algebraic number field, one may ask forthe degrees of the irreducible factors that occur when it is reduced modulo a prime ideal. In particular, onemay ask for the “density” (suitably defined) of the set of prime ideals modulo which a given pattern of irreducible-factor degrees arises. Pursuing ideas of Kro-necker, Frobenius proved that, if the galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) is thesity is the proportion of elements of the group whose symmetric group [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups), then that dencycle structure is the pattern of degrees. He conjectured that this should be true whatever the Galois group. A tool he used for this led to the name “Frobenius automorphism” for the natural generator$a \to a^{q}$ of the Galois group of a finite extension of the field F . The conjecture was proved by N. G. Chebotaryov in 1925 and is now known as the Chebotaryov density theorem, or, sometimes, the Frobenius–Chebotaryov$q$ density theorem.Another well-known and important contribution was to the theory of matrices and linear transformations, where Frobenius introduced the minimal polynomial and other invariants (the elementary divisors). theory. Like Otto Hölder andhe focused for a time on the search for Frobenius is best known for his work in finite group william burnside finite simple[VI.60](/part-06/william-burnside-18521927), groups invention of the theory of[V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups). His greatest contribution, however, is hisgroup characters [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory). This emerged unexpectedly in 1896 out of his studyof group determinants. These are the determinants of square matrices with rows and columns indexed by the members of a finite group x - 1, \text{where the xg are independent variables}, \text{one for} G, \text{and with} (a, b)-\text{entry each element respondence withab} g \text{of dedekind} G. \text{His interest}, \text{stimulated by cor}-[VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916), was in how the group determinant factorizes as a polynomial in these variables. This problem led Frobenius to the discoveryof certain sets of complex numbers, which he called gruppencharacte re the group, that arose as the solutions of sets of linear, one for each conjugacy class in equations connected with the group. Nowadays they are defined differently: for each complex linear repre-sentationρ of the group G (that is, homomorphism$784$ρinvertible matrices over: G \to GLn(C), where GLC), the associated charactern(C) is the group of n \times  nχ is the mapg \in  G. Frobenius proved the orthogonality relations, G \to  C such that χ(g) = trace ρ(g) for recognized the connection of his characters with matrix representations of the group, calculated the character tables of the symmetric groups, the alternating groups, and the Mathieu groups, and used properties of induced characters to prove his famous theorem that atransitive permutation group in which no element other than the identity fixes two or more points has a regu-lar normal subgroup (that is, a subgroup consisting of the identity together with the fixed-point-free elementsof the group). To this day no purely group-theoretic proof of this theorem has been found. In recognition of his contribution such groups are now called Frobenius groups. Through character theory and representa-tion theory, as developed by Frobenius for finite groups (and by his pupil, friend, and colleague Issai Schur for classical matrix groups), group theory found important applications in physics and chemistry a generation later.

on PDEs, which excited particular attention, contained the result now known as the cauchy–kovalevskaya theorem [[IV.12 §§2.2, 2.4]](/part-04/partial-di-erential-equations), an important tool in establishing the existence of analytic solutions of PDEs.That same year Kovalevskaya returned to Russia and, unable to find a suitable position, temporarily aban-doned mathematics. In 1880, at the invitation of chebyshev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894), she gave a paper on Abelian integrals at a conference in Saint Petersburg. It was enthusiasticall yreceived and in 1881 she returned to Berlin. She saw Weierstrass frequently and devoted herself to the studyof the propagation of light in a crystalline medium— a subject to which she had been led by studying the work of the French physicist Gabriel Lamé—and to thestudy of the rotation of a solid body about a fixed point. Later that year she moved to Paris to work with mathematicians there. In 1883, championed by Mittag-Leffler, Kovalevskaya was appointed as a Privatdozent at the University of Stockholm. She also became an editor of Acta mathematica of a scientific journal. On behalf of, making her the first woman to join the board Acta she liaised with mathematicians from Paris, Berlin, and Russia, providing an important link between Russian math-ematicians and their western European counterparts. She continued to work on the rotation problem andin 1885 made the breakthrough that, three years later, would win her the prestigious Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Sciences. Prior to her work the problem had been completely solved for only two cases, both symmetrical. In the first, solved bycenter of gravity of the moving body coincides with theeuler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), the fixed point; and in the second, solved by lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), the center of gravity and the fixed point lieon the same axis. Kovalevskaya discovered that there was a third case, one that was asymmetrical and more complicated than the other two, which could also be solved completely. (It was later shown that there are no others.) The novelty of her results lay in her application of the recently developed theory of theta functions—the simplest elements from which functions [V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem) can be constructed—to solve abelian elliptic integrals. ics at the University of Stockholm in 1889, the first woman anywhere to achieve such a position.
