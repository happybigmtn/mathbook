(1910) and gravitation (1918). Klein was an interna-
tional figure who traveled widely, including to the
United States and the United Kingdom, and he played
a significant role in the first International Congresses
of Mathematicians. His many foreign students included
several from the United States, e.g., Maxime Bôcher and
William Fogg Osgood, and a number of women, notably
Grace Chisholm Young and Mary Winston.
   Klein’s achievements made Göttingen the scientific
center of Germany and one of the mathematical cen-
ters of the world. He possessed an outstanding abil-
ity to “see” the truth in mathematical statements and
to bring mathematical fields together with out feeling
the necessity for detailed calculations and justification
(which he left to his students and others). He believed
strongly in the unity of mathematics.

After school in Berlin, Frobenius (who suppressed his
first name and wrote mainly as G. Frobenius) spent
one semester studying mathematics and physics in
Göttingen, then returned to Berlin where he stud-
ied under kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), kummer [VI.40], weier-
strass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), and others. He wrote his doctoral dis-
sertation (in Latin) supervised by Weierstrass, in 1870,
on infinite series representations of analytic func-
tions of one variable. For four years he worked as
a schoolteacher in Berlin before he became Außeror-
dentlicher Professor (associate professor) at Berlin Uni-
ver sity. After less than two years, in 1875, he was called
to a full professorship at the Eidgenössische Technis-
che Hochschule in Zürich, where he remained until

1892, when he returned to Berlin as success or to kro-
necker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891). He retired in 1916, and died one year
later.
His early contributions were to analysis and the
theory of differential equations. Later he wrote mainly
on theta functions, algebra, and number theory. One of
his well-known contributions lies across group theory
and number theory. Given a polynomial with coeffi-
cients in an algebraic number field, one may ask for
the degrees of the irreducible factors that occur when
it is reduced modulo a prime ideal. In particular, one
may ask for the “density” (suitably defined) of the
set of prime ideals modulo which a given pattern of
irreducible-factor degrees arises. Pursuing ideas of Kro-
necker, Frobenius proved that, if the galois group
[V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) is the symmetric group [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups), then that den-
sity is the proportion of elements of the group whose
cycle structure is the pattern of degrees. He conjec-
tured that this should be true whatever the Galois
nius automorphism” for the natural generator a → aq
of the Galois group of a finite extension of the field
Fq . The conjecture was proved by N. G. Chebotaryov
in 1925 and is now known as the Chebotaryov density
theorem, or, some times, the Frobenius–Chebotaryov

Another well-known and important contribution was
to the theory of matrices and linear transformations,
where Frobenius introduced the minimal polynomial

and other invariants (the elementary divisors).
Frobenius is best known for his work in finite group

he focused for a time on the search for finite simple
groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups). His greatest contribution, however, is his
invention of the theory of group characters [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory).
This emerged unexpectedly in 1896 out of his study
of group determinants. These are the determinants of
square matrices with rows and columns indexed by
the members of a finite group G, and with (a, b)-entry
xab−1 , where the xg are independent variables, one for
each element g of G. His interest, stimulated by cor-
respondence with dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916), was in how the
group determinant factorizes as a polynomial in these
variables. This problem led Frobenius to the discovery
of certain sets of complex numbers, which he called
Gruppencharacte re, one for each conjugacy class in
the group, that arose as the solutions of sets of linear
equations connected with the group. Nowadays they
are defined differently: for each complex linear repre-
sentation ρ of the group G (that is, homomorphism
