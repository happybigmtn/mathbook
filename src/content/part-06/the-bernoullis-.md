by this calculus. This is closely linked with the modern
notions of geometry and topology.
  Leibniz was one of the pioneers of actuarial theory.
Using mathematical models of human life he calculated
the purchase price of life annuities both for single per-
sons and for groups of men, and he applied such con-
side rations to the liquidation of a state’s indebtedness.
  From the very beginning of his scientific career Leib-
niz was deeply interested in logic. He conceived of a
general science: that is, of an art of inventing and of
judging all sciences by means of sufficient data and a
suitable universal language or writing. Yet, his “char-
acteristica universalis” and the ensuing logical calculi
remained fragmentary projects. His “calculus ratio cin a-
tor” was meant to be a formalized deduction of truth.
Given that Leibniz was interested in formalizing calcu-
la tions, it is not surprising that he also constructed the
first four-function calculating machine. In constructing
this machine he invented a new technical device, which
he developed in two different versions: the so-called
pinwheel (before 1676) and the stepped drum (from
1693 or earlier).

Taylor was not the first to discover the theorem that
bears his name (James Gregory found the theorem in

1671), but he was the first to publish it and the first to
appreciate its significance and applicability. The theo-
rem, which states that any function that satisfies cer-
tain conditions can be expressed as (what is now known
as) a Taylor series, was published in Taylor’s Metho-
dus Incrementorum Direct a et In versa (1715). In the
Methodus Taylor gave the series as

f (x +h) = f (x)+
(as it would appear in modern notation). Although Tay-
lor did not attend to questions of rigor—there is no
consideration of convergence, of the remainder term,
or of the validity of expressing a function by such a
series—his derivation of the series was not out of line

745
with the standards of its day. Taylor used the theorem
for approximating the roots of equations and for solv-
ing differential equations. Although he was aware of
its use for expanding functions into series, he does not
appear to have fully appreciated its significance in this
respect.
Taylor is also noted for his contribution to the prob-
lem of the vibrating string (discussed in the Methodus
and in earlier papers) and for a book on the theory of
linear perspective (1715).

Goldbach is remembered today for the conjecture that
bears his name: that every even number greater than 2
is a sum of two primes. This was first stated by euler
[VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in 1742 in a letter to Goldbach in response to the
earlier proposal by Goldbach that every number greater
than 2 is a sum of three primes (Goldbach considered
1 as a prime number). Goldbach’s conjecture, together
either prime or the sum of three primes, was first pub-
lished by waring [VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) in 1770 but with out attribu-

The Bernoullis played a remarkable role in the develop-
ment of mathematics during the Enlightenment. Indeed

such was the family’s importance that in 1715 leibniz
[VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) coined the term “bernoullizare” to describe the    appealed to by cardano [VI.7](/part-06/girolamo-cardano-15011576) and Halley: if an experi-
activity of doing mathematics. Altogether eight mem-
bers of the family devoted themselves to the mathe-
mat ical sciences (including physics, especially mechan-    equal the probability of the event. Bernoulli’s theo-
ics and fluid mechanics), and from 1687 to 1790 the
mathematics chair of the university of Basel was occu-     of large numbers [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions), establishes a first link
pied by successive members of the family: first Jacob
(1687–1705), then his brother Johann (1705–48), and
finally Johann’s son, Johann II (1748–90). Through out
the eighteenth century Bernoullis were members of the
Paris Academy of Sciences and individually they won
prestigious prizes on many occasions. The same was
true of the academies in Berlin, Saint Petersburg, and
several others.
   The family goes back to a line of Calvinist merchants   Jacob computed these numbers up to B10 .
who fled the Spanish Netherlands. The first Bernoulli
to settle in Basel was Jacob, a druggist, who became
a citizen in 1622. His grandson, Jacob I, studied phi-
losophy and theology in Basel before turning to math-
ematics, against the will of his father. This was to be
a typical pattern in the family: many of the Bernoullis
studied mathematics despite pressure from the fam-
ily to make a career in other areas (such as medicine
or law). Having received a licentiate in theology in
1676, Jacob under took an educational journey which
took him first to France, then to the Netherlands, and
finally to England. And it was through his encoun-
ters with Nicolas Malebranche, Jan Hudde, and others
that he became acquainted with Cartesianism and its
most eminent representatives. In 1677 he started his
diary, Meditationes, in which he wrote down many of
his mathematical insights and thoughts.
   Having obtained the chair of mathematics in Basel,
Jacob studied Leibniz’s early memoirs on differential
calculus, whose power he was the first, together with
his younger brother Johann I, to recognize. In a paper     problem, and a complicated isoperimetric problem that
on the curve of constant descent, published in the
Leipzig Acta Eruditorum in 1690, Jacob was the first
to use the term “integral” in its present mathemat-
ical sense. From then on he showed his mastery of
Leibnizian methods in his study of curves, including,
among others, the catenary, the form of a bent elastic     he taught until the end of his life, attracting students
beam, the form of a sail inflated by the wind, and the
parabolic and logarithmic spirals. He also solved the
differential equation y = p(x)y + q(x)y n , which is
now named after him. However he is best remembered
for his Ars Conjectandi (1713), which was published
posthumously with a short foreword by his nephew,
Nicolaus I. It contains an attempt to give a sound math-   calculus to handle exponential functions [III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions).

Johann, who had to study medicine before he could
devote himself to mathematics, got his first mathe-
mat ical training from his brother Jacob, with whom
he developed numerous applications of the new Leib-
nizian calculus to mechanics. An academic peregrina-
tion brought him to Paris in 1691–92, where he gave
private lessons to Guillaume de l’Hôpital. These lessons
are the basis of l’Hôpital’s famous Analyse des Infin-
iment Petits (1696). This textbook, the first on calcu-
lus, contains l’Hôpital’s rule, which Johann had com-
municated by letter to his student. In 1695, Johann
left Basel for Groningen to take up a professorship in
mathematics.
With the growing visibility of Johann’s work, the
friendly collaboration between the two brothers Jacob
and Johann transformed into an end less round of con-
troversies, priority disputes, and public accusations.
They engaged in heated struggles concerning the solu-
tion of the brachistochrone (curve of fastest descent)
involved minimizing the area enclosed by a curve of
fixed length. Eventually, these bitter quarrels led to an
interesting mathematical out come: the creation of the
calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). After Jacob’s death,
Johann took over the mathematics chair in Basel, where
from all over Europe, including euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783).
Johann’s most important achievement in mathemat-
ics is the development of the integral calculus. He devel-
oped a general theory for the integration of rational
functions and new methods for the solution of dif-
ferential equations. He also extended the infinitesimal
