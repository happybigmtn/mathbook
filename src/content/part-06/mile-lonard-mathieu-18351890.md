as Ahlfors’s own work indicates, remains fertile over
150 years after it was written.

Dedekind spent most of his life as a professor at the
Technische Hochschule in Brunswick, Germany (his and
gauss’s [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) home town), having spent the years
1858–62 at the Polytechnikum in Zürich (which later
became known as ETH). He obtained his mathematical
education at Göttingen, being Gauss’s last Ph. D. stu-
dent and subsequently a pupil of dirichlet [VI.36]
and riemann [VI.49]. Dedekind was a retiring man
with, as klein [VI.57] said, a “contemplative nature;”
he remained a bachelor, living with his mother and
sister. Nevertheless, he had an impact upon a select
group of contemporaries (especially cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918),
frobenius [VI.58](/part-06/ferdinand-georg-frobenius-18491917), and Heinrich Weber) through his
rich correspondence.
   A key figure in the emergence of modern set-theoretic
mathematics, and particularly the notion of a math-
ematical structure, Dedekind is best known for his
work on the foundations of the real number sys-
tem [I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). His main contribution, however, was
in algebraic number theory. Indeed, he shaped mod-
ern number theory as we know it, presenting it as a
theory of ideals in rings of integers (see algebraic
numbers [IV.1 §§4–7]). This was first made public in
1871, within Supplement X to his edition of Dirichlet’s
Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, where he established
unique decomposition of ideals into prime ideals for
all rings of algebraic integers. In the process, he for-     b. Metz, France, 1835; d. Nancy, France, 1890
mulated the concepts of field, ring, ideal, and mod-
ule (see [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)), always within the par-    Besançon (1869–74), Nancy (1874–90)
ticular context of the complex numbers. It was also
in the context of algebra (Galois theory) and num-
ber theory that Dedekind started systematic work with

quotient structures, isomorphisms, homomorphisms,
and automorphisms.
In subsequent editions of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen
(1879 and 1894) Dedekind went on refining his pre-
sentation of ideal theory, making it more purely set-
theoretic. In 1882, together with Weber, he offered a
made it possible to give a rigorous treatment of Rie-
roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). This work paved the way for
modern algebraic geometry.
Jeremy Gray       Intimately linked with Dedekind’s work in algebra
and number theory were his reflections on the foun-
Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind
using what are now known as “Dedekind cuts” in the
set of rational numbers. During the 1870 s (published
1888) he elaborated a purely set-theoretic definition of
the natural numbers as “simply infinite” sets, which
led him to crystallize the dedekind–peano axioms
[III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms). In this work, as in his more advanced research,
sets, structures, and mappings form the essential build-
ing blocks, the very foundations of pure mathematics.
In the light of (now superseded) conceptions of logic,
this led Dedekind to the view that “arithmetic (algebra,
analysis) is only a part of logic.” From a modern view-
point, his contributions show that set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory)
is a sufficient foundation for classical mathematics.
Thus he contributed as much as any body else to the
set-theoretic reformulation of modern mathematics.
