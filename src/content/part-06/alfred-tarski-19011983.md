# Alfred Tarski (1901–1983)

VI.87.    Alfred Tarski

Artin posed a conjecture about his L-functions that
remains unanswered today. Questions in non-Abelian
class field theory also remain open.
  In 1926–27, Artin and Otto Schreier developed the
theory of formally real fields: fields with the property
that −1 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares
(an example being the real numbers). This work formed
the basis of Artin’s solution of Hilbert’s seventeenth
problem concerning rational functions.
  Artin extended Wedderburn’s theory of algebras
(“hypercomplex numbers”) to noncommutative rings
with chain conditions in 1928. Indeed, the class of such
rings called “Artinian rings” is named in his honor.
  In 1929 Artin married one of his students, Natalie
Jasny. Natalie’s Jewish background and Artin’s per-
sonal sense of justice prompted them to leave Germany
in 1937. They emigrated to America, where Artin spent
a year at Notre Dame University before moving to a per-
manent position at Indian a University. Artin’s lectures
at Notre Dame led to his influential text Galois Theory
(1942), which reflected his quest for simplification and
his desire to unite different research trends.
  At Indian a, Artin began a collaboration with George
Whaples of the University of Pennsylvania and intro-
duced the concept of a valuation vector, a notion closely
related to the concept of an idèle introduced by Claude
Chevalley. This work seemed to revitalize Artin’s math-
ematical research, and, after something of a hiatus in
his written work, he began to publish regularly again.
  In 1946, Artin moved to Princeton University. While
there, Artin over saw eighteen of his thirty-one Ph. D.
students, including John Tate and Serge Lang. He also
returned to his work in the theory of braids [III.4](/part-03/braid-groups),
a topic that relates questions in topology and group
theory. His introduction to the theory of braids that
appeared in American Scientist in 1950 reveals Artin’s
prowess as a master expositor.

Tarski matured during Poland’s renaissance in math-
ematics and philosophy in the remarkable interwar

813
period of Polish independence. His teachers at the
University of Warsaw included Stanisław Leśniewski
and Jan Łukasiewicz in logic, sierpiński [VI.77](/part-06/wacaw-sierpinski-18821969) in
set theory, and Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Kazimierz
Kuratowski in topology. In his thesis Tarski solved
a core problem in Leśniewski’s idiosyncratic system
for the foundation of mathematics, but afterward he
focused on set theory and more mainstream mathemat-
ical logic. Almost immediately he obtained the spec tac-
ular banach–tarski paradox [V.3](/part-05/the-banachtarski-paradox) (that it is possible
to dissect a solid sphere into a finite number of pieces
that may then be reassembled to form two spheres of
the same radius as the original one) in collaboration
with banach [VI.84](/part-06/stefan-banach-18921945).
Encouraged by his professors, he changed his origi-
nal surname, Teitelbaum, to Tarski just before receiv-
ing his Ph. D. in 1924, because a Jewish name was a pro-
fessional handicap. This accorded with Tarski’s strong
identification with Polish nationalism and his belief
that assimilation was a rational solution to the Jewish
question.
By 1930, Tarski had established one of his most
important results: the completeness and decidability
of formal systems of the algebra of real numbers
and of Euclidean geometry axiomatized within first-
order logic (see logic and model theory [IV.23 §4](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory)).
In the following years Tarski concentrated on funda-
mental conceptual developments in metamathematics
and the semantics of formalized languages. In con-
trast with hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), who called for the execu-
tion of his met a mathematical consistency program by
the most restricted means possible, Tarski was open
to the use of any mathematical methods, including
all those of set theory. His main conceptual con tr ibu-
tion was to provide a theory of truth for formalized
languages, in which he laid down a novel criterion—
called the T-scheme—for an adequate definition of
truth for such a language, and showed how it can be
met by a set-theoretical definition within a metal an-
guage, while it cannot be defined within the language
itself.
Della Fenster        Though Tarski’s preeminence in Polish logic was
widely acknowledged, he never succeeded in obtain-
ing a chair in his country of birth, partly because of
Alfred Tarski
Semi tism, notwithstanding his change of name. Made a
finished his Ph. D., his position was later raised to that
of Adjunct Professor. Neither post paid a living wage,
and so, in order to make ends meet, Tarski also taught
