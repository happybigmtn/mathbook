b. La Haye (now “Descartes”), France, 1596; d. Stockholm, 1650
Algebra; geometry; analytic geometry; foundations of mathematics

In 1637 Descartes published La Géométrie as an “essay”
appended to his philosophical treatise Discours de la
Méthode. It remained his only mathematical public a-
tion. No single early modern text shaped the devel-
opment of mathematics between 1650 and 1700 as
strongly as La Géométrie. It was the founding text of
analytic geometry and it paved the way for the merging
of algebra and geometry that made possible the devel-
opment of the integral and differential calculus about
fifty years later.
   Descartes was educated at the Jesuit College at La
Flèche. He spent his life mostly out side France, travel-                               René Descartes
