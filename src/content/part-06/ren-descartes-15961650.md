Algebra; geometry; analytic geometry; foundations of mathematics

In 1637 Descartes published La Géométrie as an “essay”
appended to his philosophical treatise Discours de la
Méthode. It remained his only mathematical public a-
tion. No single early modern text shaped the devel-
opment of mathematics between 1650 and 1700 as
strongly as La Géométrie. It was the founding text of
analytic geometry and it paved the way for the merging
of algebra and geometry that made possible the devel-
opment of the integral and differential calculus about
fifty years later.
   Descartes was educated at the Jesuit College at La
Flèche. He spent his life mostly out side France, travel-
ing through Europe in his early twenties and living in
the Netherlands from 1628 until 1649; he then left for
Sweden, invited by Queen Christina to her court. From
an early age his interest in mathematics was tightly
linked to his primary philosophical preoccupation: the
certainty of knowledge. In a letter of 1619 he sketched
a method, clearly inspired by arithmetic and geometry,
for solving all problems in natural philosophy. Shortly
afterward, his ideas grew into a passionate conviction
that he could and should develop a philosophy along
these problem-solving and mathematics-inspired lines.
La Géométrie grew out of the mathematical part of his
philosophical program; it was not a textbook on ana-
lytic geometry. Descartes offered little in the way of
general principles, explaining his ideas by means of
examples.
   Descartes used a classical problem, Pappus’s prob-
lem, in order to explain coordinates and equations of
curves, and showed that the defining property of a
curve could be written as an equation. He introduced
coordinates x and y, using oblique as well as rectan-
gular coordinate axes, which he always adjusted to the
problem at hand. He also introduced the now very com-
mon usage of employing x, y, and z for unknowns and
a, b, and c for indeterminate fixed quantities.
   For Descartes, a geometrical problem required a geo-
metrical answer. The equation was at best an algebraic
reformulation of the problem; the answer had to be a
construction of the curve or of individual points. If, as
in the particular case of Pappus’s problem in four lines,
the equation was quadratic, then for any fixed value of
y the x-coordinate was a root of a quadratic equation.
Earlier in the book Descartes had shown how such a

root could be constructed (using ruler and compass).
Thus, the curve could be constructed “pointwise” by
choosing a series of values for y and constructing the
corresponding xs and points on the curve. Pointwise
construction could not provide the whole curve. There-
fore in Pappus’s problem Descartes used the equation
to show that the solution curves were conic sections,
and explained how to determine the nature of the conic,
the location of its axes, and the values of its parameters.
This was an impressive result; it was, in fact, the first
classification of an algebraically defined class of curves.
A further influential result in La Géométrie, and the
one of which Descartes himself said he was most proud,
was his method to determine the normal (and thus
also the tangent) at a given point on a curve with
a given equation. It was a pre-calculus forerunner of
differentiation.
There are three important differences between how
Descartes treated curves and their equations and how
they are treated in modern analytic geometry: he
employed oblique as well as rectangular axes; he did
not consider the equation as defining a curve—rather
it represented a problem, namely to construct the curve
itself, as well as its axes, tangents, etc.; and he did not
consider the plane itself as a collection of points char-
acterized by pairs of real numbers—for him the xs and
ys were not dimension less numbers but the lengths
of line segments. (The term “Cartesian plane” for R2 is
therefore anachronistic.)
Descartes supposed (too optimistically) that his pro-
cedures could be extended to polynomial equations
