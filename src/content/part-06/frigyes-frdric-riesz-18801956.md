bounded in various ways; in particular, H . nfty consists
of bounded analytic functions. Hardy and Littlewood
deduced fundamental properties of H p from their max-
imal theorem, which relates a function to its “radial
limits” at the boundary of the disk. The theory of H p
spaces has found numerous applications not only in
analysis, but also in probability theory and control
theory.
  Hardy and Littlewood loved inequalities of all kinds;
their book on the subject with George Pólya, an instant
classic the moment it was published in 1934, greatly
influenced the development of hard analysis.
  Although Hardy was fiercely proud of the purity of
his mathematics, in a paper published in 1908 he for-
mulated the extension of the Mendelian law about the
proportions of dominant and recessive characters. This
law, which later became known as the Hardy–Weinberg
law, refuted the idea “that a dominant character should
show a tendency to spread over a whole population,
or that a recessive should tend to die out.” In a later
article he dealt a severe blow to eugenics by giving a
simple mathematical argument that showed the futility
of forbidding people with “undesirable” characteristics
to breed.
   In his interest in mathematical philosophy, Hardy
was a disciple of russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), whose political views
he also shared. He was a secretary of the committee
which forced the abolition of the order of merit in
the Mathematical Tripos through a reluctant Senate in
1910, and many years later he fought hard for the abo-
lition (not reform!) of the Mathematical Tripos itself,
which he considered to be harmful to mathematics in
the United Kingdom. After World War I, Hardy led the
British efforts to heal the wounds of the international
mathematical community, and with the advent of the
Nazi persecutions on the Continent in the early 1930 s,
he was an important figure in an extensive network
finding jobs for refugee mathematicians in the United
States, Britain, and the Commonwealth. He was a great
supporter of the London Mathematical Society: he was
not only one of the secretaries for close to twenty years,   German mathematician Ernst Fischer; so it is named
but also its president for two terms.
   Hardy was a militant atheist; as an affectation, he
liked to talk of God as his personal enemy. He was a
great conversation a list, and was fond of various intel-
lectual games, like putting together cricket teams of
bores, bogus poets, Fellows of a Cambridge college, and
so on. He loved ball games, especially cricket, baseball,    a function of bounded variation. It was to be a fertile

tennis (as opposed to lawn tennis); to praise people, he
frequently likened them to outstanding cricketers.
He had an exceptional gift for collaboration and
launching young mathematicians on their research
careers. He was a master not only of mathematics, but
also of English prose; he was lively and charming, and
left a lasting impression even on his casual acquain-
tances. His poetic book A Mathematician’s Apology,
written toward the end of his life, gives a rare insight
into the world of a mathematician.

Functional analysis; set theory; measure theory
After being educated at Budapest University and else-
where in Europe, Riesz was appointed in 1911 to the
University of Kolozsvár (Hungary), which moved in
1920 to become Szeged University; he served twice
as Rector. He returned to Budapest in 1946. Most of
Riesz’s research work lay in mathematical analysis
enriched with techniques from set and measure theory,
and functional analysis.
One of Riesz’s famous results was the converse of
a generalization of Parseval’s theorem for fourier
series [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform): given a sequence of orthonormal func-
tions on a finite interval, and a sequence a1 , a2 , . . . of
real numbers, there exists a function f that can be
expanded as a Fourier-type series with respect to those

functions with the ar as coefficients if and only if r a2 r
is convergent; further, f is itself square summable. He
proved the theorem in 1907, simultaneously with the
after both of them.
Two years later Riesz found the “representation the-
orem” named after him. It states that a continuous lin-
ear functional that maps continuous functions F over
a finite interval I onto the real numbers can be repre-
sented as a Stieltjes integral of F over I with respect to
source of applications and generalizations.
