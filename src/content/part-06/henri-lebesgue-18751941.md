Lebesgue studied at the École Normale in Paris (1894–
97), where he was influenced by the slightly older
borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956) and René-Louis Baire. As a teacher at
Nancy he completed his seminal thesis “Intégrale,
longueure, aire” (1902). After university positions in
Rennes, Poitiers, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, and fol-
lowing war-related research, Lebesgue became a pro-
fessor at the Sorbonne (1919) and then, finally, at the
Collège de France (1921). One year later he was elected
to the French Academy of Sciences.
   Lebesgue’s most important achievement was his gen-
eral ization of riemann’s [VI.49] notion of an integral.
This was partly in response to the need to include
broader classes of real-valued functions, and partly to
give secure foundations to concepts such as the inter-
change ability of limit and integral in infinite series (par-
ticular ly Fourier series). Alluding to a famous example
(1881) by Vito Volterra of a bounded derivative that
could not be integrated, Lebesgue wrote in his thesis:
  The kind of integration defined by Riemann does not
  allow in all cases for the solution of the fund a men-
  tal problem of the calculus: find a function with a
  given derivative. It thus seems natural to search for a
  definition of the integral which makes integration the
  inverse operation of differentiation in as large a class
  of functions as possible.
  Lebesgue defined his integral by partitioning the
range of a function and summing up sets of x-coor-
dinates (or arguments) belonging to given y-coordi-
nates (or ordinates), rather than, as had traditionally
been done, partitioning the domain. Lebesgue himself,
according to his colleague, Paul Montel, compared his
method with paying off a debt:
  I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my
  pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and
  give them to the credit or in the order I find them until
  I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann inte-
  gral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken

out all my money I order the bills and coins according
to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one
after another to the credit or. This is my integral.
The comparison reveals the more theoretical charac-
ter of Lebesgue’s integral, as compared with the more

intuitive and natural summation used by Riemann. This
meant that more sophisticated functions, which were

“summable” according to Lebesgue.
In order to perform his summations, Lebesgue had
to base his new integral on Borel’s notion of measure
[III.55](/part-03/measures) (1898), which in turn drew heavily on cantor’s
[VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) theory of infinite sets. He used infinitely many
intervals to cover and to measure sets, and was thus
able to measure much less intuitive subsets of the lin-
ear continuum (the reals) than had hitherto been con-
side red. A crucial role was played by the notion of
“the set of measure zero” and the consideration of
properties that were valid “except for” such sets, i.e.,
“almost every where.” This allowed for the theory to be
streamlined to include fundamental results such as: “A
bounded function is Riemann integrable if and only if
the set of its points of discontinuity has measure zero.”
Lebesgue completed Borel’s theory of measure, mak-
ing it a true generalization of jordan’s [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) ear-
lier theory. From Jordan he also borrowed the impor-
tant notion of a function of bounded variation for his
theory of the integral. Lebesgue ascribed a measure to
any subset of a “set of measure zero,” and opened up
broader theoretical questions such as whether there
exist any sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable. The
latter question was proved in the affirmative by the Ital-
ian Giuseppe Vitali in 1905 with the help of the axiom
of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice), while Robert Solovay showed in 1970,
with methods of mathematical logic, that with out the
axiom of choice such existence cannot be proved (see
set theory [IV.22 §5.2](/part-04/set-theory)). Lebesgue himself remained
skeptical about an unlimited use of set-theoretical prin-
ciples such as the axiom of choice. He held a rest ric-
tive view of the “existence” of mathematical objects by
making “definability” the touchstone for his empiricist
philosophy of mathematics.
Lebesgue’s integral—the idea of which was paral-
leled, although not in such depth, in the work of
the English mathematician W. H. Young—served as a
sophisticated stimulus to developments in harmonic
and functional analysis (e.g., the Lp spaces of riesz
[VI.74](/part-06/frigyes-frdric-riesz-18801956) (1909)). Generalizations to functions defined on
n-dimensional space, proposed by Lebesgue himself
