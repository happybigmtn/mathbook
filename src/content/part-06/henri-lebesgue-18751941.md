Lebesgue studied at the École Normale in Paris (1894–                [III.55](/part-03/measures) (1898), which in turn drew heavily on cantor’s
97), where he was influenced by the slightly older                    [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) theory of infinite sets. He used infinitely many
borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956) and René-Louis Baire. As a teacher at                  intervals to cover and to measure sets, and was thus

Collège de France (1921). One year later he was elected              “almost every where.” This allowed for the theory to be

This was partly in response to the need to include                      Lebesgue completed Borel’s theory of measure, mak-
