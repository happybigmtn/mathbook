in law, to devote himself to his personal passion,
“géométrie” (that is, mathematics).
   D’Alembert’s first communications to the French
Académie were concerned with the analytic geometry
of curves, the integral calculus, and fluid resistance,
notably the problem of the deceleration and deflec-
tion of a disk entering a fluid, which was linked to the
Cartesian explanation of refraction of light. He made
a close reading of newton’s [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) Principia, his com-
ment ary on passages of the first book showing his clear
preference for analytical methods over the synthetic
geometry of Newton.
   D’Alembert’s Traité de Dynamique (1743) made him
famous in learned circles. He built up a systematic and
rigorous theory of mechanics founded upon a short
list of well-chosen principles—inertia, composition of
motions (i.e., the addition of the effects of two forces or
powers), and equilibrium—while at the same time try-
ing to avoid metaphysical arguments. Most notably he
proposed an important general principle, known today
as “d’Alembert’s principle,” to simplify the investiga-
tion of constrained systems, such as the compound
pendulum, vibrating rods, strings, rotating bodies, and
even fluids, which he considered to be aggregates of
parallel slices. The essential idea behind the principle     with Euler and daniel bernoulli [VI.18](/part-06/the-bernoullis-) about the pos-
was to reduce a problem in dynamics to one in statics,
roughly speaking by introducing a fictitious force, the
“kinetic reaction,” which was minus the mass times the
acceleration. This allowed techniques from statics to be     and his efforts to find rigorous foundations for the sci-
brought to bear on problems in dynamics.
   His other books and memoirs were developments,
some very innovative, in fluid theory, partial differ en-
tial equations, celestial mechanics, algebra, and inte-
gral calculus. He devoted much thought to the use and
status of imaginary numbers.
   In his Réflexions sur la Cause Générale des Vents
(1747) and his Recherches sur le Calcul Intégral (1748)
he observed that numbers of the form a + bi (where
    . qrt{i} = −1) retain the same form when subjected to the
usual operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and exponentiation). He proved that, for a real
polynomial, imaginary roots always occur in conjugate
pairs, and that even if a real polynomial has no real
root, there is still always a complex root. However, his
work was not rigorous—for example, he presupposed
the existence of roots—and consequently he did not
provide a proof of the fundamental theorem of
algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra).
   At the end of the 1740 s there was a crisis in New-
tonian science, with d’Alembert, Clairaut, and euler

[VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) each independently coming to the conclusion
that Newton’s theory of gravitation could not account
for the motion of the Moon. In 1747 d’Alembert dis-
cussed various possibilities for solving the problem—
an additional force, or a very irregular shape for the
Moon, or some vortices between Earth and Moon—and
produced a long study on celestial mechanics and plan-
etary perturbations that has only recently been redis-
covered and published (see d’Alembert 2002). By 1749
an improved mathematical analysis of the problem
had shown that Newton’s theory was correct. The rest
of d’Alembert’s extensive work on celestial mechanics
was published in his Recherches sur la Précession des
Équinoxes (1749), Recherches sur Différents Points du
Système du Monde (1754–56), and in some of the eight
volumes of his Opuscules (1761–83).
In 1747 d’Alembert presented a paper on the famous
problem of vibrating strings, Recherches sur la Courbe
que Forme une Corde Tendue Mise en Vibration (1749).
This paper contained a solution of the wave equation
[I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). This was the first solution of a partial differ en-
tial equation—partial differential equations were a new
tool that he had already used in his 1747 Réflexions sur
la Cause Générale des Vents. It led to a lengthy debate
sible form of the solutions and the general notion of
function.
D’Alembert’s work for the Encyclopédie (1751–65)
ences led him into the field of philosophy, where his
main contributions concerned the classification of var-
ious sciences. He also worked on the study of cogni-
tion following the lines proposed by descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650),
Locke, and Condillac.
