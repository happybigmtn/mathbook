of any degree (usually connected to Pappus’s problem
with more than four lines) and that therefore he had
shown how, in principle, all geometrical construction
problems could be solved. For higher-order con struc-
tions he needed new algebraic techniques. The relevant
section in La Géométrie constituted the first general
theory of polynomial equations and their roots. It con-     reception of Descartes’s La Géométrie: the philosophi-

negative roots of a polynomial, various transformation
rules, and methods to check equations for reducibility.     mathematical aspects were eagerly accepted and used.
He gave no proofs; his results were based on a convic-
tion that polynomials could essentially be written as
products of linear factors x − xi , in which the roots xi   Bos, H. J. M. 2001. Redefining Geometrical Exactness: Des-
could be positive, negative, or “imaginary.”
   It appears, then, that analytic geometry was not the
primary goal of La Géométrie. Rather, its aim was to
provide a universal method for solving geometrical
problems, and to do so Descartes had to answer two
urgent methodological questions. The first was how to
solve geometrical problems not constructible by ruler
and compass, and the second was how to use algebra
as an analytic, i.e., solution-finding, tool in geometry.
   For the first of these, Descartes allowed successively    VI.12
more complicated curves as means of construction. It
was Descartes’s conviction that algebra, through the
equations of these curves, could guide him to choose,
among all such construction curves, the most appro-
priate for the problem, in particular the simplest, i.e.,   south of France, contributed decisively to most of the
that of lowest degree.
   The second question addressed serious conceptual
difficulties that were felt at the time about using alge-     tle is known about his early life—even the date of his
bra in geometry. The transfer of algebraic operations
to geometry was indeed problematic because multipli-
cation in geometry was generally interpreted dimen-
sion ally: for example, a product of two lengths had to
represent an area, and a product of three a volume.
But until then algebra had dealt mostly with numbers
and had routinely used products of more than three
factors. Thus, a consistent and unrestricted geomet-
rical interpretation of the operations of algebra was
needed. Descartes did indeed provide such a re inter-
pretation. He introduced a unit line segment in such
a way that multiplication no longer raised the dimen-
sion and inhomogeneous terms could be allowed in
equations.
   By 1637 he had given up on his earlier attempts to
link philosophy and mathematics. Yet the preoccupa-
tion with certainty remained. As his concept of con-
struc tion involved the use of curves, he had to consider    with constructions of loci: that is, of sets of points (usu-
which curves could be understood by the human mind

with sufficient clarity to be acceptable in geometry. His
answer was that all algebraic curves were acceptable (he
called these “geometrical curves”) and all others were
not (these he called “mechanical”). Few seventeenth-
century mathematicians followed Descartes in this
strict demarcation of geometry. This is typical of the
ignored by his mathematical readers, but the technical

Fermat, who spent his life as a magistrate in the
mathematical subjects of his time: from quadrature
to optics, from geometry to number theory. Very lit-
birth is uncertain—but by 1629 he had close contacts
with viète’s [VI.9](/part-06/franois-vite-15401603) scientific heirs in Bordeaux. His work
displays a thorough knowledge of ancient as well as
contemporary mathematics and he exchanged prob-
lems and mathematical information by correspondence
with, among others, rené descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650), Gilles Per-
sonne de Roberval, Marin Mersenne, Bernard Frenicle,
John Wallis, and Christiaan Huygens.
A crucial early-modern topic was the use of algebra to
solve geometric problems. Viète and other algebraists
before him had used equations in a single unknown
to rewrite and solve “determinate” problems (prob-
lems admitting a finite number of solutions). In his
manuscript Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge, which
circulated in Paris in 1637 (the same year as Descartes’s
La Géométrie), Fermat presented a general way of han-
dling and solving indeterminate problems associated
