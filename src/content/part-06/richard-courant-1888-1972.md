Ramanujan conjectured thatprimep. The study of this problem led to deep andn=1 n|=τ(p)1 | < 2 p1(1/)2 for every extensive work on modular forms by H. Petersson, R. Rankin, and others. Eventually, the conjecture was proved by P. Deligne, who received the Fields Medal forhis achievement in 1978. ments all the more amazing. As a child he was math-ematically precocious. In high school he won prizes in The full story of Ramanujan’s life makes his achieve mathematics. On the basis of his high school record, he won a scholarship to the Government College in Kumbakonam in 1904.
At about this time, ramanujan came into contact with the book A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics Carr. This rather eccentric book is essentially a hugeby G. S. collection of formulas and theorems compiled for stu-dents preparing for the celebrated Mathematical Tripos examination at Cambridge. This book fascinated Ramanujan, who became obsessed with mathematics. In college, he neglected his other subjects and gavehis all to mathematics. Consequently, he failed some subjects and lost his scholarship.
By 1913, Ramanu-jan seemed destined for obscurity—he was now a mere clerk in the Madras Port Trust. Friends encouraged himto write to English mathematicians about his mathematical discoveries. Eventually he wrote to G. H. Hardy, who was able to discern that Ramanujan was a truly extraordinary mathematician. Hardy arranged for Ramanujan to travel to England, and between 1914 and 1918 the two of them produced the groundbreaking work described above. In 1918, Ramanujan became ill with a sickness diagnosed as tuberculosis. He convalesced in England for ayear.
His health improved a little in 1919 and he was able to return to India. Unfortunately, his health wors-ened after his return, and he died in 1920. During this last year in India he penned the pages now known as Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook and therein laid the foundations of the theory of mock theta functions, a class offunctions similar to but more general than the classical theta functions.

New York, 1972 Mathematical physics; partial differential equations; minimal surfaces; compressible flow; shock waves The long and eventful life of Courant was full of high achievements: in mathematical research, the applications of mathematics, as a teacher of many future math-ematicians, as a writer of superb books on mathematics, and as an organizer and administrator of large institutions.
The fact that Courant—an outsider in his native Germany and a refugee in the United States—could accomplish these things is a testament to his personality as well as to his scientific outlook. Born in Lublinitz, Courant completed his high school training in Breslau, living on his own and support-ing himself by tutoring. His older Breslau friends, Hellinger and Toeplitz, went on to Göttingen, then themecca of mathematics, and in due course Courant followed them.
There he was taken on as an assistantto hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and he began a close friendship with Harald Bohr, which was later extended to Harald’s brother Niels. Under Hilbert’s direction, Courant wrote his dissertation on the use of(on minimizing energy) for constructing conformal dirichlet’s principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis) maps. Courant also used Dirichlet’s principle in several further mathematical studies. army as an officer; he fought on the western front andwas seriously wounded.

Courant became close friends with the publisher Ferdinand Springer. One of the fruits of this relationship was the famous “Grundlehren” series of monographs,
