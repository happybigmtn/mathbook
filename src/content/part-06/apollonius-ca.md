circle and of a sphere, and by treatises on spiral curves, conoids, and paraboloids, and on the Quadrature of the Parabola. While following an axiomatic-deductive framework, Archimedes’ style is distinctive. Many of his theorems about curved figures use the so-called method of exhaustion [II.6](/part-02/idea-of-proof) . Take the problem of determining the area of a circle. Archimedes accomplished this by showing that it had the same area as that of a certain right-angled triangle.
Since it was known how to calculate the area of a triangle, he was “reducing” a problem whose solution was unknown to one whose solution was known. Rather than establishing this directly, he proves that the area of the circle can be neither larger than nor smaller than the area of the triangle, so that only one possibility remains: that they are equal. This is achieved, here and in general, by inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures to the curvilinear figure under investigation, thus getting closer and closer to it.
The leap from closer and closer approximation to equivalence of a rectilinear and curvilinear figure, however, can be accomplished only indirectly, by excluding the other possibilities. Such arguments usually employ a lemma, already found in Euclid, to the effect that if we start with a quantity and replace it by a quantity at most half as large, and then repeat this, then what remains can be made as small as we please. Archimedes’ output also includes The Sand-Reckoner, about astronomy and arithmetic, and works on the centers of gravity of plane figures and on bodies immersed in a fluid.
Above all, Archimedes provides unique insights into the processes of ancient Greek mathematics. The second part of Sphere and Cylinder contains problems about constructing given solid bodies. Several of the proofs are in two parts: analysis and synthesis. In the analysis, the result one wants to establish is taken as proved, and consequences are drawn from it, until one hits upon a result that is already proved elsewhere, and the process is then reconstituted in reverse (the “synthesis ”).
The recently rediscovered Method (addressed to Eratosthenes) reveals that Archimedes arrived at some of his most famous results, e.g., the area of a segment of a parabola, by imagining the two objects involved (say , a segment of a parabola and a triangle) as divided up into an infinite number of slices and lines, then placed at the two ends of a balance and set in equilibrium with each other. Archimedes underlined that this heuristic procedure was not a strict proof, but that $735$ only makes the Method all the more valuable a glimpse into the mind of a great mathematician.

locus problems The Conics, in eight books, only seven of which have come down to us, has had fewer modern readers than other recognized masterpieces of Greek mathematics: it is complex, difficult to summarize, and easy to mistranslate into modern algebraic notation. Apollonius of Perga also wrote about arithmetic and astronomy, but none of these works survive. The letters prefacing six of the surviving books indicate that he was a highly esteemed member of a network of mathematicians, to whom he sent his results.
He refers to the fact that various versions of his Conics were circulated, the latest probably incorporating his correspondents’ feedback. Knowledge of the parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse predates Apollonius (we find conics in Archimedes), but his is the first known systematic account of these curves, which were of interest both in themselves and because they could be used as auxiliary lines for the solution of problems such as the trisection of an angle or the duplication of the cube.
Apollonius himself declares that the first four books of the Conics are an introduction to the subject, and indeed he starts with definitions of the cone and its various parts. The parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse are not introduced until later, so that their origin (from a plane cutting a cone or a conic surface at different angles) is already accompanied by a statement of their properties, which are further and fully explored in the next three books. These include theorems on tangents, asymptotes, and axes; constructions of conic sections on the basis of certain data;
and an account of the conditions under which conics can intersect in the same plane. The nonelementary books, which exist only in Arabic, contain treatments of maximum and minimum lines

within the sections, the construction of conic sections
equal or similar to a given conic section (including the
theorem that all parabolas are similar), and “diorismic
theorems.” These are propositions that set the limits
of possibility of a construction, or the limits of valid-
ity of some property of a geometrical configuration,
given a certain number of known positions or known
objects at the outset. Indeed, several of the pro posi-
tions in the Conics are about loci, i.e., geometrical con-     term “algorithm” is derived).
figurations consisting of all the points sharing a certain
family of properties. Apollonius criticizes euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca)
for not having provided an exhaustive solution to the
construction of the three-line and four-line locus (con-
figurations of three or four lines, arranged so that they
have specific properties).
   In terms of demonstrative methods, Apollonius is
in the axiomatic-deductive mold: general enunciations,
lettered diagrams, each step justified by appeal to
undemonstrated premises or previous proofs. Instead
of in direct methods, we find a real mastery of the intri-
cacies (and power) of proportion theory. At the same
time, his propositions easily lend themselves to the
consideration of different subcases: when, for instance,
a certain line falls inside, out side, or on the vertex of a    ably, al-Khwārizmı̄ did not regard these equations just
conical surface. Apollonius, in other words, combines a
systematic approach with an almost playful fascination
with exploring the possibilities of mathematical objects
and their properties under varying circumstances.

Arithmetic; algebra
Al-Khwārizmı̄, or possibly his ancestors, came from
Khwārizm (the modern region of Khorezm in Uzbek-
istan, also known as Khiva). Most of his life was spent
as a scholar at the House of Wisdom, Baghdad, where
he produced works on astronomy, mathematics, and
geography. Of his mathematical works, two have come
down to us, one on arithmetic and one on algebra.

VI. Mathematicians
The arithmetical work, which did not survive in Ara-
bic and is known only through Latin translations, was
the means by which Hindu numerals were transmitted
to the West, as well as the corresponding methods of
arithmetical calculation. Although the text was clearly
based on Indian writings, in Europe the techniques
became particularly associated with al-Khwārizmı̄’s
name in the form of algorism (from which the modern
Al-Khwārizmı̄’s al-Kitāb al-mukhtas.ar fı̄ h
. isāb al-jabr
wa’l-muqābala (“The compendious book on calcul a-
tion by completion and balancing”) became the starting
point for the subject of algebra for Islamic mathemat i-
cians. A work of elementary practical mathematics, it
is written in three parts: one was devoted to solving
equations, one to practical mensuration (areas and vol-
umes), and one to problems that arose mainly from
the complicated Islamic laws of inheritance (involving
arithmetic and simple linear equations). No algebraic
symbolism is employed: everything, including numer-
als, is expressed in words. The text opens with a brief
discussion of the place-value system and then deals
with equations of the first and second degrees. Remark-
as a means for solving problems, as his predecessors
had done, but studied them in their own right, classi-
fying them into six separate types. In modern notation
these are
ax 2 = bx,          ax 2 = b,     ax = b,
2                    2
ax + bx = c,          ax + c = bx,           ax 2 = bx + c,
types are necessary because al-Khwārizmı̄ did not rec-
ognize the existence of either negative numbers or zero
as coefficients. Not only did al-Khwārizmı̄ give proofs
that his methods worked, which in itself was not stan-
Serafina Cuomo            dard at the time, but the proofs he gave were geomet-
rical ones. That is, they were not classical Greek proofs
but geometrical demonstrations of the validity of his
methods.
al-Khwārizmı̄
The key word of the Arabic title, al-jabr (“comple-
tion” or “restoration”), which refers to restoring all the
terms to a standard form, eventually came into com-
mon usage in the West as algebra. It is, however, doubt-
ful that al-Khwārizmı̄’s work was the first Islamic work
bearing that name.
