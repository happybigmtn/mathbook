circle and of a sphere, and by treatises on spiral curves, conoids, and paraboloids, and on the Quadrature of the Parabola. While following an axiomatic-deductive framework, Archimedes’ style is distinctive. Many of his theorems about curved figures use the so-called method of exhaustion [II.6](/part-02/idea-of-proof) . Take the problem of determining the area of a circle. Archimedes accomplished this by showing that it had the same area as that of a certain right-angled triangle.
Since it was known how to calculate the area of a triangle, he was “reducing” a problem whose solution was unknown to one whose solution was known. Rather than establishing this directly, he proves that the area of the circle can be neither larger than nor smaller than the area of the triangle, so that only one possibility remains: that they are equal. This is achieved, here and in general, by inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures to the curvilinear figure under investigation, thus getting closer and closer to it.
The leap from closer and closer approximation to equivalence of a rectilinear and curvilinear figure, however, can be accomplished only indirectly, by excluding the other possibilities. Such arguments usually employ a lemma, already found in Euclid, to the effect that if we start with a quantity and replace it by a quantity at most half as large, and then repeat this, then what remains can be made as small as we please. Archimedes’ output also includes The Sand-Reckoner, about astronomy and arithmetic, and works on the centers of gravity of plane figures and on bodies immersed in a fluid.
Above all, Archimedes provides unique insights into the processes of ancient Greek mathematics. The second part of Sphere and Cylinder contains problems about constructing given solid bodies. Several of the proofs are in two parts: analysis and synthesis. In the analysis, the result one wants to establish is taken as proved, and consequences are drawn from it, until one hits upon a result that is already proved elsewhere, and the process is then reconstituted in reverse (the “synthesis ”).
The recently rediscovered Method (addressed to Eratosthenes) reveals that Archimedes arrived at some of his most famous results, e.g., the area of a segment of a parabola, by imagining the two objects involved (say , a segment of a parabola and a triangle) as divided up into an infinite number of slices and lines, then placed at the two ends of a balance and set in equilibrium with each other. Archimedes underlined that this heuristic procedure was not a strict proof, but that $735$ only makes the Method all the more valuable a glimpse into the mind of a great mathematician.

locus problems The Conics, in eight books, only seven of which have come down to us, has had fewer modern readers than other recognized masterpieces of Greek mathematics: it is complex, difficult to summarize, and easy to mistranslate into modern algebraic notation. Apollonius of Perga also wrote about arithmetic and astronomy, but none of these works survive. The letters prefacing six of the surviving books indicate that he was a highly esteemed member of a network of mathematicians, to whom he sent his results.
He refers to the fact that various versions of his Conics were circulated, the latest probably incorporating his correspondents’ feedback. Knowledge of the parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse predates Apollonius (we find conics in Archimedes), but his is the first known systematic account of these curves, which were of interest both in themselves and because they could be used as auxiliary lines for the solution of problems such as the trisection of an angle or the duplication of the cube.
Apollonius himself declares that the first four books of the Conics are an introduction to the subject, and indeed he starts with definitions of the cone and its various parts. The parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse are not introduced until later, so that their origin (from a plane cutting a cone or a conic surface at different angles) is already accompanied by a statement of their properties, which are further and fully explored in the next three books. These include theorems on tangents, asymptotes, and axes; constructions of conic sections on the basis of certain data;
and an account of the conditions under which conics can intersect in the same plane. The nonelementary books, which exist only in Arabic, contain treatments of maximum and minimum lines
