# Hermann Weyl (1885–1955)

VI.80.   Hermann Weyl

and Littlewood were among the first to combine topo-
logical and analytical methods to tackle differential
equations, and discovered many of the phenomena
that later became known as “chaos”: they proved that
chaos could arise even in equations originating in real
engineering problems.
   From 1910 until his death sixty-seven years later, Lit-
tle wood lived in the same set of spacious rooms in Trin-
ity College, Cambridge. He was a great raconteur: after
almost every dinner he was to be found in the Combi-
nation Room drinking claret in the company of Fellows
and any mathematicians who might be visiting. In spite
of his tremendous output, he suffered for decades from
severe bouts of depression, from which he was cured
only in 1957. He practiced his belief that mathemat i-
cians should take a vacation of at least twenty-one days
a year during which they should do no mathematics. He
was a keen and skilled rock climber and an avid Alpine
skier. Although not an active musician, on most days
he listened to Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart for hours
on end.
   In 1943, when he was awarded the Sylvester Medal
of the Royal Society, the citation read: “Littlewood,
on Hardy’s own estimate, is the finest mathematician
he has ever known. He was the man most likely to
storm and smash a really deep and formidable prob-
lem; there was no one else who could command such a
combination of insight, technique and power.”

Weyl studied mathematics at Göttingen under hilbert
[VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), klein [VI.57], and minkowski [VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909) between
1904 and 1908. His first teaching positions were at Göt-
tingen (1910–13) and ETH Zürich (1913–30). In 1930 he
accepted the call to Göttingen as Hilbert’s success or.
After the rise to power of the Nazis, he emigrated to
the United States and became a member of the newly
founded Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton
(1933–51).
   Weyl made contributions to real and complex analy-
sis, geometry and topology, lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory), num-

ber theory, the foundations of mathematics, mathemat-
ical physics, and philosophy. He contributed at least
one book to each of these fields, publishing thirteen in
total. Together with his other technical and conceptual
innovations, these books were all of lasting influence:
many had a pronounced and immediate effect.
His early research dealt with integral operators and
differential equations with singular boundary condi-
tions. His fame came later, with his book The Con-
cept of a Riemann Surface (1913). This grew out of
a lecture course in the winter of 1910–11 and built
upon Klein’s intuitive treatment of riemann’s [VI.49]
geometric function theory and Hilbert’s justification of
the dirichlet principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis). Here Weyl gave
a new presentation of the properties of riemann sur-
faces [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces), which became highly influential for the
geometric function theory of the twentieth century.
His second book, The Continuum (1918), marked
the beginning of Weyl’s interest in the foundations of
mathematics. He was critical of Hilbert’s “form a list”
program for an axiomatic foundation of mathematics,
and explored the possibility of a semi-formalized arith-
met ical approach to a strictly constructivist foundation
of real analysis. Shortly there after he shifted toward
brouwer’s [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966) intuitionistic program and attacked
Hilbert’s foundational views even more strongly in a
famous article of 1921. In the late 1920 s he devel-
oped a more balanced view of the foundational ques-
tions. After World War II he returned to a weak pref-
erence for his arithmetical constructive approach of
1918.
At the same time as he was working on foundational
questions Weyl took up Einstein’s theory of general rel-
Béla Bollobás     ativity and wrote his third book, Space–Time–Matter.
It was first published in 1918, and appeared in five
successive editions until 1923. This was one of the
Hermann Weyl
first monographs on relativity theory and was among
tip of the iceberg of his contributions to differential
geometry and general relativity. Weyl under took this
research within a broad conceptual and philosophical
framework. One of the out comes of this approach was
his Analysis of the Problem of Space (1923), in which he
sketched ideas that would later be analyzed in terms of
the geometry of fiber bundles [IV.6 §5](/part-04/algebraic-topology) and the study
of gauge fields. He had already introduced gauge fields
(and the key idea of a point-dependent rescaling of the
metric) in 1918 for a generalization of riemannian
geometry [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and a geometrically unified field
theory of gravity and electromagnetism.
