Nothing is known about Euclid’s life. In fact, his major
work, the Elements, is now seen as a rather loose
collection, with no strong authorial voice and no clear
way of determining what, if any, Euclid’s original contri-
but i ons were. Born in the cultural climate of Ptolemaic
Alexandria, the text probably aimed at systematizing
the current knowledge in some mathematical areas.
   The Elements covers plane geometry (including the
squaring of any rectilinear figure, the bisection of an
arc, the inscription and circumscription of polygons
in circles, the finding of a mean proportional), solid
geometry (e.g., the ratio of spheres to one another, the
five regular solids), and arithmetic, from relatively sim-
ple (the properties of odd and even numbers, prime
number theory) to more complex (commensurable and
incommensurable lines, binomials and apotomes).
   The title hints at the foundational character of the
text, which starts with definitions of mathematical
objects (e.g., point, straight line, scalene triangle), pos-
tulates (e.g., all right angles are equal to one another)
and common notions (e.g., the whole is greater than the
part). These initial premises are not demonstrated—
whether some postulates are demonstrable spawned
debate in antiquity, and later led to non-Euclidean
geometries. In a style which has been termed axiomatic-
deductive, proofs tend to be general rather than spe-
cific; they use a restricted set of formulaic expressions,
refer to a lettered diagram, and each of their steps
is justified by appeal to undemonstrated premises, to
previous proofs, or to very simple notions, such as
the principle of the excluded middle. Some proofs use
reductio ad absurdum: instead of directly showing that
something is the case, they proceed to show that any
alternative is impossible.
   There are parts of the book that reveal the presence
of different, less abstract, demonstrative procedures.
For instance, one of the theorems establishing crite-
ria for two triangles to have the same area refers to
one triangle being “superimposed” on the other, with
the reader effectively invited to verify that their areas
are indeed equal. The appeal is to a mental opera-
tion, which is quite different from the logical step-by-
step method found elsewhere. Again, book IX contains
propositions on odd and even numbers, which are often
seen as vestiges of Pythagorean mathematics, to be

“geometric algebra,” so that book II, ostensibly about
squares and rectangles built on segments of straight
lines, would in fact foreshadow modern equations.
As well as works on astronomy, optics, and music,
the Data, which is about solving geometrical prob-
lems on the basis of some elements that are already
given, is also attributed to Euclid. His fame is, however,
inextricably linked to the Elements. The very absence
of a strong authorial voice has perhaps facilitated
other mathematicians’ interaction with the text, which
has been appropriated, added to, interfered with, and
commented upon since antiquity. This very plasticity
helped to make it possibly the most popular mathe-
mat ical book of all time. (For more about its impact on
the early development of mathematics, see geometry
[II.2](/part-02/geometry-origins), the development of abstract algebra [II.3](/part-02/abstract-algebra-development),
and the development of the idea of proof [II.6](/part-02/idea-of-proof).)

Archimedes’ life was as spectacular as his scientific
achievements: various sources attest that he built a
ship, a cosmological model, and magnificent catapults
with which he defended his native Syracuse during
the Second Punic War. The Roman besiegers eventually
took the city by deceit, and Archimedes was killed in
the ensuing pillage. According to legend, his tomb was
engraved with a sphere inscribed in a cylinder, to mark
one of his most famous discoveries. Indeed, the first
part of his Sphere and Cylinder reaches a climax with
a proof that the volume of every sphere is two thirds
of that of the cylinder circumscribing it. Archimedes’
interest in establishing the volume or area of curved fig-
ures is also attested by his discovery of the area of the
