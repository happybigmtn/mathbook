# Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877–1947)

VI.73.   Godfrey Harold Hardy

(1910), contributed to even more general theories of
integrals, e.g., the theory of Radon (1913).
  Although it took several decades for the importance
of Lebesgue’s integral to become widely recognized, its
significance for applications, especially in the analysis
of discontinuous and statistical phenomena of nature
and in probability theory, could not be ignored in the
long run.

G. H. Hardy was the most influential mathematician in
Britain in the twentieth century. With the exception of
the years from 1919 to 1931, when he was the Savil-
ian professor of geometry in Oxford, he spent his adult
life in Cambridge, where from 1931 until his retirement
in 1942 he was the Sadleirian professor of pure math-
ematics. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in
1910 and was awarded a Royal Medal in 1920 and the
Sylvester Medal in 1940. He died on the day the Royal
Society’s highest honor, the Copley Medal, was to be
presented to him.
   At the beginning of the twentieth century, the stan-
dard of mathematical analysis was rather low in Britain;
Hardy did much to remedy this situation, not only
through his research, but also by publishing A Course of
Pure Mathematics in 1908. This book, which he wrote
as “a missionary talking to cannibals,” had a tremen-
dous influence on several generations of mathemat i-
cians in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, Hardy’s
love of pure mathematics, and analysis in particular,
some what stifled the growth of applied mathematics
and algebraic subjects for several decades.
   In 1911 he began a long collaboration with little-
wood [VI.79](/part-06/john-edensor-littlewood-18851977), with whom he wrote almost one hun-
dred papers: this partnership is generally considered
to have been the most fruitful in the history of math-
ematics. They worked on convergence and summa bil-
ity of series, inequalities, additive number theory

[V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859) (including Waring’s problem and Goldbach’s con-
jecture), and Diophantine approximation.
Hardy was one of the first to do important work on
the riemann hypothesis [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory) when, in 1914, he
proved that the zeta function ζ(s) = ζ(σ + it) has
infinitely many zeros on the critical line σ = 12 (see
littlewood [VI.79](/part-06/john-edensor-littlewood-18851977)). Later, with Littlewood, he proved
deep extensions of this result.
From 1914 to 1919 he collaborated with the large-
ly self-taught Indian genius, srinivasa ramanujan
[VI.82](/part-06/srinivasa-ramanujan-18871920). They wrote five papers, the most famous of
which is about p(n), the number of partitions of n.
This is a rapidly growing function: p(5) = 7 but
p(200) = 3 972 999 029 388.

is equal to 1/((1 − z)(1 − z2 )(1 − z3 ) · · · ), so

p(n) =                dz,

where Γ is a circle about the origin of radius just less
than 1. In 1918, Hardy and Ramanujan not only gave
a rapidly convergent asymptotic formula for p(n) but
also showed that, for n large enough, p(n) could be
calculated exactly by taking the integer nearest to the
sum of the first few terms. In particular, p(200) can be
computed from the first five terms.
Hardy and Ramanujan proved their asymptotic for-
mula for p(n) with the aid of the “circle method”; later,
Hardy and Littlewood developed this method into one
of the most powerful tools in analytic number theory. In
order to estimate contour integrals like the one above,
Hardy and Littlewood found it advisable to break up
the circle of integration in a subtle way.
Another Hardy–Ramanujan result concerns the num-
ber ω(n) of distinct prime divisors of a “typical” num-
ber n. They proved that a “typical” number n has about
log log n distinct prime factors in a certain precise
sense. In 1940 Erdős and Kac sharpened and extended
this result by showing that additive number-theoretic
functions like ω(n) obey the gaussian law [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions)
of errors: this gave birth to the important field of
probabilistic number theory.
Hardy’s name has been attached to several con-
cepts and results, including Hardy spaces, Hardy’s
inequality, and the hardy–littlewood maximal the-
orem [IV.11 §3](/part-04/harmonic-analysis). For 0 < p ⩽ . nfty the Hardy space H p
