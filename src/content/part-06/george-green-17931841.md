geometry, given a line in a plane and a point not on
the line there are two lines through the point that are
asymptotic to the given line (one in each direction);
these two lines separate the lines through the point
which meet the given line from those that do not. Loba-
che vskii called these the parallels to the given line
through the given point. Starting from this definition,
he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles,
and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-
iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the
triangles are very small. He extended his results to
describe a geometry of three dimensions, thus mak-
ing it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-
etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to mea-
sure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether
his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account
of space than Euclidean geometry.
   He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in
Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they
drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-
grad ski i, a much better known mathematician in Saint
Petersburg. He published in French in a German jour-
nal in 1837, in German in a book let of 1840, and again
in French in 1855, but to little avail. gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855)
appreciated the book let of 1840 and in 1842 had Loba-
che vskii made a corresponding member of the Göttin-
gen Academy of Sciences, but this was to be the only
acclaim Lobachevskii received in his lifetime.
   Lobachevskii’s final years were marked by terrible
financial and mental decline. Such was the chaos of his
household that Lobachevskii’s biographers have been
unable to establish the number of children born into it,
but it may well have been fifteen or even eighteen.

Green, a self-taught mathematician, went to Cambridge
University at the age of forty, having already produced

his most important work, the privately printed An Essay
on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the The-
ories of Electricity and Magnetism (1828). In this work,
which Green opened by stressing the central role of the
“potential function” (a term that he himself coined), he
proved the three-dimensional version of the theorem
now named after him, and introduced the concept that
riemann [VI.49] later called Green’s function (1860).
The Essay became widely known only after its discovery
in 1845 by William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who
was responsible for its republication in the Journal für
die reine und angewandte Mathematik (1850–54).
Green gave his version of the theorem (in modern
notation) as
∂V
UΔV dv +          U dσ =     V ΔU dv + V        dσ ,
dn
where U and V are two continuous functions of x, y, z
whose derivatives are not infinite at any point of an
arbitrary body, n is the surface normal of the body
directed inward, and dσ is a surface element. The result
today known as Green’s theorem, which is the planar
version of the above, was first published by cauchy
[VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) in 1846, and it can be given (in modern nota-
tion) as follows. Let R be a closed plane region with
a piecewise-smooth boundary curve C with positive
orientation. Let P (x, y) and Q(x, y), having continu-
ous partial derivatives, be defined on an open region
containing R. We then have
∂Q   ∂P
(P dx + Q dy) =
C                          R    ∂x   ∂y
More original than his theorem, however, was the
powerful technique Green developed to solve certain
second-order differential equations. In essence, Green
sought a “potential function” and formulated the con-
ditions it needed to satisfy. His great insight was to
recognize that the central issue in potential theory was
to relate properties inside volumes to properties on
their surfaces. Green’s functions are extensively used
today in the solution of inhomogeneous differential
