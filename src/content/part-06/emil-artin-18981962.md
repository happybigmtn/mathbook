  Of Wiener’s many analytical results that make con-
nections between very different domains we give only
one as an example. Around 1931 Wiener discussed the
following (Lebesgue) integral equation with the German
mathematical astrophysicist Eberhard Hopf:

The solution for unknown f (t), which was found with
the help of a new and very important factorization
technique, and which was dependent on the analyt-
ical behavior of the fourier transforms [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) of
the functions involved, could be connected to radia-
tive equilibrium in stars. When t is interpreted as time,     VI.86
equations of this kind can be seen to describe causal-
ity: the transition from the influencing “past” to the
indeterminate “future.” A decade later the Wiener–Hopf
equations would be connected to Wiener’s theories of
prediction and filtering.
   Wiener’s discussion of such disparate fields of appli-
cation could not fail to invoke philosophically relevant
notions such as causality, information (Wiener is con-
side red together with Claude Shannon as the founder
of the modern concept of information), control, feed-
back, and finally the wide-ranging theory of “cyber-
netics.” Cybernetics (literally, the art of steering) can     at the University of Leipzig, and completed his doctor-

broad out look resulted from his collaboration with
colleagues from very different domains: mathemat i-
cal (R. E. A. C. Paley), physical (Hopf), technical (Julian   He achieved the rank of full professor in 1926. While

However, this out look left him vulnerable to criticism
and to philosophical and political misinterpretati on.
The prominent mathematician Hans Freudenthal was
a sharp-tongued critic of Wiener’s epoch-making book
of 1948, Cybernetics or the Control and Communica-
tion in the Animal and the Machine, claiming that it
“shows there is not much to be reported” and that it
“has contributed to spreading mistaken ideas of what
mathematics really means,” although even he had to
admit that the book “earned Wiener the greater part of
his public renown” and that its “mathematical readers
were more fascinated by the richness of its ideas than
by its shortcomings.”
   During the period of the Nazi threat Wiener helped
refugees from Europe to settle in the United States,
while after World War II he cautioned against the repeti-     question on reciprocity but it also formed the central
tion of mistakes such as the boycott of German science
in the aftermath of World War I. Wiener warned against

Born in fin de siècle Vienna to an art dealer father and
opera singer mother, Artin was influenced through out
his life by the rich cultural atmosphere of the late Haps-
burg Empire. He was, as the algebraist Richard Brauer
described him, as much artist as mathematician. After
his first semester at the University of Vienna in 1916,
Artin was drafted into the Austrian Army, in which he
served until the end of World War I. In 1919 he enrolled
ate under the direction of Gustav Herglotz in only two
Artin spent the academic year 1921–22 at the math-
ematically vibrant University of Göttingen, and then
moved to the recently opened University of Hamburg.
at Hamburg, Artin over saw the work of eleven doc-
toral students, including Max Zorn and Hans Zassen-
haus. Artin’s years at Hamburg were among the most
productive of his life.
Artin’s work in class field theory [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), the sub-
ject closest to his heart, led him to a solution of
Hilbert’s ninth problem: a proof of the most general law
of reciprocity. The aim was to generalize Gauss’s law of
quadratic reciprocity and the higher reciprocity laws.
Teiji Tagaki’s fundamental results on class field theory
had appeared when Artin was a student. Using Takagi’s
theory, N. G. Chebotaryov’s 1922 proof of the density
theorem (conjectured by frobenius [VI.58](/part-06/ferdinand-georg-frobenius-18491917) in 1880),
and his own theory of L-functions [III.47](/part-03/l-functions), Artin estab-
lished his general law of reciprocity in 1927. Artin’s the-
orem not only provided the final form of the classical
result of class field theory. Both Artin’s result and his
tools, particularly his L-functions, proved important.
