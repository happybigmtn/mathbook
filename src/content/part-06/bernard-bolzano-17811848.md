A brilliant graduate of the École Polytechnique in 1800,
Poisson was quickly appointed to the staff, and became
professor and graduation examiner there until his
death. He was also founder professor of mechanics at
the new Paris Faculté des Sciences of the Université
de France; from 1830 he was also a member of the
governing Council of the Université.
   Poisson’s research output was dominated by his
adherence to the traditions established by lagrange
[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827). Like Lagrange he pre-
ferred to algebraize theories, and to rely if possible
upon power series and variational methods. From the
mid 1810 s he challenged the new theories of fourier
[VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (especially the solving of differential equations
by trigonometric series and the Fourier integral) and
of cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) (the new approach to real-variable
analysis using limits, and his innovation of complex-
variable analysis). His over all achievements were much
less significant than theirs: the main novelties were
the “Poisson integral,” which embedded Fourier series
within a power series; and a summation formula. He
also studied the general and singular solutions of
differential, difference, and mixed equations.
   In physics Poisson tried to justify Laplace’s claim
that all physical phenomena were molecular, and that
the cumulative action upon a molecule of all its com-
panions should be expressed mathematically in terms
of an integral. He applied this approach to heat dif-
fusion and to elasticity theory by the mid 1820 s, but
then decided that integrals should be replaced by sums;
he elaborated this alternative especially in capillary
theory (1831). Curiously, molecularism did not domi-
nate his most important contributions to physics: to
electrostatics (1812–14) and to magnetic bodies and
the process of magnetization (1824–27). His mathemat-
ical contributions to these topics included modifying
Laplace’s equation to what we now call Poisson’s equa-
tion, which deals with the potential at points inside a
charged body or region of charge (1814); and also a
divergence theorem (1826).

In mechanics, between 1808 and 1810 Poisson and
Lagrange developed the brackets theory (named after
them) of canonical solutions to the equations of mo-
tion. Poisson’s motivation was to extend, to second-
Jeremy Gray   order terms in masses of the planets, Lagrange’s superb
attempt to prove that the planetary system was sta-
ble; in later work he examined this (first-order) prob-
Siméon-Denis Poisson
lem specifically, as well as other aspects of perturb a-
tion theory. He also analyzed rotating bodies by using
moving frames of reference (1839), in an analysis that
was to inspire Léon Foucault to propose his famous
long pendulum in 1851. His best-known publications
include a substantial and wide-ranging two-volume
Traité de Mécanique (editions in 1811 and 1833), which
did not, however, have room for Louis Poinsot’s beau-
tiful recent theory (1803) of the couple in statics. In
the mid 1810 s, he studied deep-body fluid dynamics,
in rivalry with Cauchy.
Poisson was one of the few contemporaries to take
up Laplace’s work in probability theory and mathe-
mat ical statistics. He studied various probability dis-
tributions [III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions): not only the one named after him
(1837, rather in passing) but also the so-called Cauchy
(1824) and Rayleigh (1830) distributions. He also exam-
ined proofs of the central limit theorem [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions),
and formulated the law of large numbers [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions)
(his term). One of his main applications was to the old
problem of determining the probability that a triad of
judges would come to the correct decision in court
cases (1837).

Bolzano was concerned with problems connected with
finding the “correct,” or the most appropriate, proofs
and definitions in analysis and related areas. In 1817
he proved an early version of the intermediate value
theorem for continuous functions—he was among the
first to have a rigorous conception of a continuous
function—and in the course of doing so proved the
