  Pascal is also known for a theorem in projective
geometry (given an arbitrary hexagon inscribed in any
conic section, if the three pairs of opposite sides are
continued until they meet, then the three points of
intersection lie on a straight line) (1640); and for a two-
function (addition and subtraction) mechanical calcu-
lating machine (1645).

Newton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661,
and it was in Cambridge that he spent most of his for-
mative years, first as a student, then as a Fellow, and
then, from 1669, as Lucasian Professor of Mathemat-
ics. His election to the Lucasian Chair was engineered
by his mentor Isaac Barrow, a talented mathematician
and theologian who was the first to hold the presti-
gious chair. In 1696 Newton moved to London to take
up the post of Warden of the Mint. He resigned his
professorship in 1702.
   It appears that Newton’s interest in mathematics
began in 1664. In that year he embarked on a course
of self-instruction, reading viète’s [VI.9](/part-06/franois-vite-15401603) works (1646),     sight, realized that most of the problems dealt with by
Oughtred’s Clavis Mathematicae (1631), descartes’s
[VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) La Géométrie (1637), and Wallis’s Arithmetica
Infinitorum (1656). From Descartes, Newton learned
how useful it could be to relate algebra to geom-
etry, since plane curves could be represented by alge-
braic equations in two unknowns. Descartes had, how-
ever, imposed strict limitations on the class of curves
allowed in La Géométrie: “geometrical” (i.e., algebraic)
curves were admitted but “mechanical” (i.e., trans cen-
dental) ones were not. In common with many of his con-
temporaries, Newton felt that such limitations ought to
be over come and that a “new analysis” capable of deal-
ing with mechanical curves ought to be possible. He
found the answer in infinite series.
   Newton had learned how to deal with infinite series
from Wallis’s work, and it was while elaborating one
of Wallis’s techniques that, in the winter of 1664,
he obtained his first great mathematical discovery:
the binomial theorem for fractional powers. This pro-
vided him with a method for expanding into power
series a large class of “curves,” including transcenden-
tal curves, which could now be given an “analytical”
representation to which the rules of algebra could be
applied. Termwise application of the relation (which

he knew from Wallis and which is expressed in famil-
iar Leibnizian notation as x n dx = x n+1 /(n + 1))
allowed him to “square” a variety of curves when they
were expanded as a power series. (In the seventeenth
century, squaring a curvilinear figure meant finding
a square the area of which is equal to that of the
curvilinear figure.)
A few months later, Newton, with extraordinary in-
his contemporaries could be reduced to two classes:
problems in which one is required to find the tangent
to a curve, and problems in which one is required to
find the area subtended by a curve. He conceived geo-
metrical magnitudes as being generated by continuous
motion. For example, the motion of a point generates
a line and the motion of a line generates a surface.
These he called “fluents,” while the instantaneous rate
of flow he called the “fluxion.” Basing his intuitions on
kinematical models, he formulated a version of what is
known today as the fundamental theorem of cal-
culus [I.3 §5.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Namely, he proved that tangent and
area problems are inverses of each other. In modern
terms, Newton was able to reduce quadrature prob-
lems (i.e., calculating curvilinear areas) to the search for
primitive functions (indefinite integrals). He built “cat-
alogues of curves” (tables of integrals), deploying tech-
niques equivalent to substitution of variables and inte-
gration by parts. He developed an efficient algorithm
that allowed him to tackle both the direct (differential)
and inverse (integral) methods of fluxions. He was able
to calculate the tangent to and curvature of any known
curve, and perform integrations of many classes of
(what we now call) ordinary differential equations. Such
