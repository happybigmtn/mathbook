bounded in various ways; in particular,$H \infty\text{consists}$ of bounded analytic functions. Hardy and littlewood deduced fundamental properties of$H^{p} \text{from their max}-$ imal theorem limits” at the boundary of the disk. The theory of, which relates a function to its “radial$H^{p}$ spaces has found numerous applications not only in analysis, but also in probability theory and control theory. their book on the subject with George Pólya, an instant Hardy and Littlewood loved inequalities of all kinds;

This law, which later became known as thelaw, refuted the idea “that a dominant character should Hardy–Weinberg show a tendency to spread over a whole population, or that a recessive should tend to die out.” In a later article he dealt a severe blow to eugenics by giving asimple mathematical argument that showed the futility of forbidding people with “undesirable” characteristics to breed. was a disciple of In his interest in mathematical philosophy, hardy russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), whose political views he also shared.
He was a secretary of the committee which forced the abolition of the order of merit in the Mathematical Tripos through a reluctant Senate in1910, and many years later he fought hard for the abolition (not reform!) of the Mathematical Tripos itself, which he considered to be harmful to mathematics inthe United Kingdom.
After World War I, Hardy led the British efforts to heal the wounds of the international mathematical community, and with the advent of the Nazi persecutions on the Continent in the early 1930 s, he was an important figure in an extensive network finding jobs for refugee mathematicians in the United States, Britain, and the Commonwealth. He was a great supporter of the London Mathematical Society: he wasnot only one of the secretaries for close to twenty years, but also its president for two terms. Hardy was a militant atheist; as an affectation, he liked to talk of God as his personal enemy.
He was agreat conversationali st, and was fond of various intellectual games, like putting together cricket teams ofbores, bogus poets, Fellows of a Cambridge college, and so on. He loved ball games, especially cricket, baseball, bowls (with the curved woods of his college), and real

tennis (as opposed to lawn tennis); to praise people, he frequently likened them to outstanding cricketers. He had an exceptional gift for collaboration and launching young mathematicians on their research careers. He was a master not only of mathematics, but also of English prose; he was lively and charming, andleft a lasting impression even on his casual acquaintances. His poetic book A Mathematician’s Apology, written toward the end of his life, gives a rare insight into the world of a mathematician.

Budapest, 1956 Functional analysis; set theory; measure theory After being educated at Budapest University and else-where in Europe, Riesz was appointed in 1911 to the University of Kolozsvár (Hungary), which moved in 1920 to become Szeged University; he served twiceas Rector. He returned to Budapest in 1946. Most of Riesz’s research work lay in mathematical analysis enriched with techniques from set and measure theory, and functional analysis.
a generalization of Parseval’s theorem forseries One of Riesz’s famous results was the converse of[III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform): given a sequence of orthonormal func-fourier tions on a finite interval, and a sequence real numbers, there exists a functionf athat can be1, a2, . . . of expanded as a Fourier-type series with respect to those functions with theaas coefficients if and only ifa2 is convergent; further, proved the theorem in 1907, simultaneously with ther f is itself square summable.
