   While a student in Königsberg, Minkowski became a
close friend of Adolf Hurwitz and hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943). In
1894, after Hurwitz had moved to Zürich, Minkowski
returned from Bonn to his alma mater, and soon
became Hilbert’s success or after Hilbert left for Göt-     and the einstein equations [IV.13 §1](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)). He re inter-
tingen. In 1896, Minkowski moved on to Zurich to
become Hurwitz’s colleague. In 1902, Hilbert nego-
tiated for another chair of mathematics to be cre-
ated for Minkowski in Göttingen. There he worked as
Hilbert’s colleague and closest friend until he died,
unexpectedly, of a ruptured appendix in early 1909.

By interpreting the quadratic forms in terms of geo-
metric objects such as ellipses (for n = 2) or ellip-
soids (for n = 3), and considering the integer val-
ues of the variables as the coordinates of the points
of a regular lattice, Minkowski was able to employ
the notion of volume to arrive at nontrivial number-
theoretic results. His investigations were published in
1896 in a book entitled The Geometry of Numbers. Real-
izing that the geometric arguments based on ellipsoids
used only the property of convexity, Minkowski fur-
ther generalized his theory by introducing a general
concept of convex point sets. A convex body, accord-
ing to Minkowski, is one in which the straight line con-   b. Versailles, France, 1865; d. Paris, 1963
