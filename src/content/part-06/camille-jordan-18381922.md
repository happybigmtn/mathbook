wave equation for the vibrations of an elliptical mem-
brane. These functions, which are special cases of the
hypergeometric function, are particular solutions of
Mathieu’s equation:

where a and q are constants that depend on the
physical problem.
  Mathieu is also known for his discovery of the five
Mathieu groups. These were the first sporadic simple
groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups) (meaning that they did not fit into one
of the known infinite families of simple groups) to be
found. It is now known that there are twenty-six such
groups altogether, although it was almost a century
after Mathieu before a sixth one was found.

the jordan normal form [III.43](/part-03/jordan-normal-form) of a matrix, although

Lie was twenty-six when he discovered that, in his
own words, he “harbored a mathematician.” Before
then he had primarily wanted to be an observational
astronomer. Later in life, looking back on his career,
he said that it was the “audacity of his thinking” more
than any formal knowledge and education that had
given him a position among the fore most of mathe-
maticians. During a career spanning more than thirty
years, Lie produced almost eight thousand pages of
mathematics, making him one of the most productive

mathematicians of his time.
Lie graduated in general science from the university
in Oslo in 1865 but with out showing any special apti-
tude for mathematics. It was not until 1868, when he
attended a lecture by the Danish geometer Hierony-
and Plücker, that he became inspired by modern geom-
etry. He studied the works of Poncelet (projective geom-
etry) and Plücker (line geometry), and wrote a disserta-
tion on “imaginary geometry,” that is, geometry based
to Berlin, Göttingen, and Paris, where he met mathe-
maticians who would remain friends and colleagues for
the rest of his life. In Berlin he met klein [VI.57], in
Göttingen he met Clebsch, and in Paris, where he was
joined by Klein, he met Darboux and jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922).
through his theory of surfaces and Jordan through his
knowledge of group theory and the work of galois
recognize the value of group theory for the study of
geometry. Lie and Klein published three joint papers
on geometrical topics, including one on the so-called
Lie line–sphere transformation (the contact trans for-
lines into spheres and principal tangent curves into
curvature lines; and then the study of the geometrical

“Erlanger Programm” (his character ization of geometry
as properties invariant under a group action), Lie was
