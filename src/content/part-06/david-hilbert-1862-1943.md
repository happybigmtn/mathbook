Though heloved mathematics for its beauty, a beauty that transcends human failures, Hilbert saw mathematics as asocial collaboration. A turning point came when he met minkowski [VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909) and Adolf Hurwitz at university in Königsberg. Hilbert wrote: “On unending walks we engrossed ourselves in the actual problems of the mathematics of the time; exchanged our newly acquired understandings, our thoughts and scientific plans;
and formed a friendship for life.” Later Hilbert became professor at Göt-tingen and, with klein [VI.57], drew mathematicians from all over the world and turned that small city into acrossroads for mathematics—until Hitler destroyed it. would study mathematics as he taught, and he resolved When he was a new Privatdozent, Hilbert decided he never to repeat lectures. He and Hurwitz decided toembark on a “systematic exploration” of mathematics, and he followed this pattern for the rest of his life. Hilbert’s career divides easily into six periods: (i) algebra and algebraic invariants (1885–93);
(ii) algebraic number theory (1893–98); (iii) geometry (1898–1902);

(iv) analysis (1902–12); (v) mathematical physics (1910–22); and (vi) foundations (1918–30). Remarkably, there is very little overlap. When Hilbert finished a subject, he was finished with it. solved Gordan’s problem, named after Paul Gordan, ina single bold move. Given a polynomial equation with at Hilbert’s first breakthrough came in 1888 when he least two variables, some things about the polynomial change and some do not when you change coordinate systems. For example, consider the real polynomial equation ax2 + bxy + cy2 + d = 0.

If you rotate the coordinate system, then this equation changes dramatically, but the graph does not, and nei-ther does the discriminant$b^{2} - 4ac$. The discriminant is one invariant. In the general case—a more compli-cated class of polynomials and coordinate changes— there can be many invariants. Mathematicians sus-pected that a finite number of essentially different invariants existed for any given type of polynomial and class of coordinate changes. Was this so? Many mathematicians calculated individual examples industriously. Instead, Hilbert reasoned indirectly:
what ifthere is no finite basis for a specific class of polynomials and transformations? He found that it was always possible to produce a contradiction. He concluded that there must be such a basis. At first this result was greeted with disbelief because he did not display a basis. Gordan said, “Das ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist
