geometry with algebraic methods that had originated
from Islamic sources, and in doing so laid the founda-     knowns by vowels A, E, . . . , so that numbers were

analyzing and solving geometric problems.
   Viète’s understanding of analysis was based on his
reading of the Synagoge (“Collection”) of Pappus (early    was Thomas Harriot in England, who, through study
fourth century c.e.), where analysis was described as
a method of investigating a problem by assuming that
the solution is in some sense known, as we would do
now by representing the solution by a symbol and car-
rying out mathematical manipulations involving that
symbol. Algebra achieves this by regarding all quan-
tities, known or unknown, as of equal status; equa-
tions are then formed from prestated conditions (a pro-    profoundly influenced by it. descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650), on the
cess Viète called zetetics), and solved to produce the     other hand, denied that he had ever read either Viète
unknown quantity in terms of those given (exegetics).
For Viète the final step in geometric problems was to
provide a specific construction for the solution: this
was the geometric synthesis arising from the preceding     equations of finite degree. Only much later in the sev-
algebraic analysis.
   In several further treatises, mostly written or pub-    analysis extended to include what were thought of as
lished around 1593, Viète taught the necessary skills
of forming equations and carrying out the correspond-
ing geometric constructions, and these books together
made up his Opus Restitutae Mathematicae Analyseos,
seu Algebra Nova (“The work of restored mathematical
analysis, or the new algebra”), which he offered with the
famous and ambitious hope of leaving no mathematical
problem unsolved (nullum problem a non solvere). For
most of the seventeenth century, algebra continued to
be known as the “analytic art,” or simply “analysis.”
   Recognizing that not all equations could be solved
algebraically, Viète also put forward a method of
numerical solution based on successive approxima-
tions. This was the first appearance of such techniques     (they are found in the work of the tenth-century Islamic
in Europe, and was important not only for practical
purposes, but also because it rapidly led to a deeper
understanding of the relationships between roots and
coefficients of equations.
   Viète’s style of writing is wordy and often obscure,    adoption in Europe. Stevin, however, did not use the
thanks in part to his liking for technical Greek terms.    notation we use today. He drew circles around the expo-
In his algebraic treatises, however, he devised some
rudimentary notation. It had long been the case that
rules for solving equations were presented through
particular examples that were understood to repre-
sent a general class, but Viète took the step of replac-   for weights and measures and for coinage.

and A cubus), and his connectives (“added to,” “equals,”
algebra was still very far from symbolic.
One of the first people to study Viète’s work in depth
of Viète’s numerical method shortly after 1600, dis-
covered that polynomials could be written as prod-
ucts of linear and quadratic factors, a major break-
through in the understanding of equations. Harriot also
rewrote much of Viète’s mathematics in what is essen-
tially modern algebraic notation. In France, Viète’s work
was taken up in the 1620 s by fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665), who was
or Harriot, though in the 1630 s he developed a number
of very similar ideas.

infinite equations, or what we would now call infinite
series, hence bringing the word “analysis” much closer
to its modern meaning.

The Flemish mathematician and engineer Simon Stevin
is remembered for his study of decimal fractions.
Although he was not the first to use decimal fractions
mathematician al-Uqlı̄disı̄), it was his tract De Thiende
(“The tenth”), published in 1585 and translated into
English (as Disme: The Art of Tenths, or Decimall Arith-
metike Teaching) in 1608, that led to their widespread
nents of the powers of one tenth: thus he wrote 7.3486
as 7.0 3.1 4.2 8.3 6.4 . In De Thiende Stevin not only
demonstrated how decimal fractions could be used but
also advocated that a decimal system should be used
