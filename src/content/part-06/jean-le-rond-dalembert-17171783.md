call “convex,” V − E + F = 2, where V is the number of
vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number
of faces. (For details about the flaws in Euler’s proof,
see Richeson and Francese (2006).)

of elastic curves. At the command of his king, Frederick
the Great of Prussia, he studied hydraulics, designed
pumps and fountains, and evaluated the probabilities
and combinatorics involved in the state lotteries.
   In a triangle, the line on which the orthocenter, the
centroid, and the circumcenter lie is the Euler line.
The Euler method is an algorithm for giving numeri-
cal solutions to differential equations. The euler dif-
ferential equation [III.23](/part-03/the-euler-and-navierstokes-equations) is the partial differential
equation that describes continuity of fluid flow.

   He left Switzerland in 1727 to work in the new
academy of Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg. In 1741
he moved to Berlin and the academy of Frederick the
Great, but returned to Saint Petersburg in 1766, after
the ascension of Catherine the Great. He was blind
for the last fifteen years of his life, during which time
he nevertheless wrote over three hundred papers. He
won the annual prize competition of the Paris Academy
twelve times.
   His series of calculus books, published in four vol-
umes between 1755 and 1770, were the first success-
ful calculus textbooks. It was the climax of a complete
series of mathematical textbooks, including arithmetic
(1738), algebra (1770), and the Introductio in Analysin
Infinitorum (1748), a textbook on the mathematics
Euler thought was necessary to understand calculus.
   In the two volumes of the Mechanica (1736), Euler
gave the first calculus-based treatment of the mechan-
ics of point masses. He followed this with another two-
volume work, Theoria Motus Corporum (1765), on the
motions of solid bodies, including rotations.
   Other books include Methodus Inveniendi (1744),
the first unified treatment of the calculus of varia-
tions, Tentamen Novae Theoriae Musicae (1739), on the
physics of music and including the first use of loga-
rithms in the theory of pitch, three different books on
celestial mechanics and lunar theory, two on the theory
of shipbuilding, three on optics, and one on ballistics.     permanent climate of controversy and the end less

Euler standardized the use of the symbols e, π , and i, as

well as   for summations and Δ for finite differences.
His Letters to a German Princess in three volumes
(1768–71) is regarded variously as the first work of pop-
ular science writing by a first-rate scientist and as an
Laplace is reported to have advised, “Read Euler.
Read Euler. He is the master of us all.” The words are
probably not those of Laplace, but the misattribution
does not affect the quality of the advice.

D’Alembert spent his whole life in Paris, where he
became one of the most influential members of the
Académie Royale des Sciences and of the Académie
Française. He became well-known as the scientific edi-
tor of the celebrated French Encyclopédie, the twenty-
eight-volume work on which he collaborated with Denis
Diderot, and for which he wrote most of the mathemat-
ical and many of the scientific articles.
As a student at the Jansenist Collège des Quatre-
Nations, he followed the usual curriculum of grammar,
rhetoric, and philosophy, the latter including some
Cartesian science, a little mathematics, and much the-
ology framed by the then burning debate about pre-
destination, freedom, and grace. Disgusted with the
metaphysical discussions among his Jansenist teach-
ers, d’Alembert decided, after attaining his diploma
