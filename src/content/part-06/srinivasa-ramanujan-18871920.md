theorem and the Skolem paradox. Skolem had real-
ized, long before anyone else, that mathematical the-
ories nearly always have several different models. He
argued that there are axiom systems, and one can prove
theorems in these settings, but what is meant by the
objects that obey these rules will generally vary from
case to case. From this he drew the radical conclu-
sion that attempts to build mathematics on axiomatic
theories were unlikely to succeed (although nowadays,
of course, mathematics built on axiomatic foundations
has become overwhelmingly successful).
   Skolem’s insistence on first-order theories, in which
variables may range only over elements, not subsets,
was one that his contemporaries took time to accept.
But that viewpoint, and the great clarity that comes with
it, is today the overwhelmingly dominant one. Skolem
insisted that the only possible logic to use in any inves-
ti gation of the foundations of mathematics was first-

order logic [IV.22 §3.2](/part-04/set-theory), and that second-order theo-
ries were impermissible in the foundations, precisely
because second-order theories allowed the axioms to
refer to sets, but the nature of sets was, in his view,
one of the topics to be elucidated. Skolem also felt

that, while one can talk of individual objects, talk of all     These have applications ranging from lie theory
objects of a certain kind can be problematic if it is too
in formal. Indeed, a generation earlier mathematicians
had encountered the paradoxes of naive set theory,
where loose talk about all sets of certain kinds causes
real difficulties: for example, Russell’s paradox of the
set of all sets that are not members of themselves (if it
is a member of itself, then it is not, but if it is not, then   Thus, for example, the second identity asserts that the
it is).
   Skolem’s work is also characterized by a distrust of
the concept of infinity and a preference for finitistic rea-
soning. He was an early advocate of primitive recur-
sion [II.4 §3.2.1](/part-02/algorithms), which deals with the theory of what
are called computable functions, as a way of avoiding
paradoxes concerning the infinite.

for many of the breakthroughs in number theory in
the twentieth century. He worked on analytic num-
ber theory, as well as on elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem),
hypergeometric series, and the theory of continued
fractions [III.22]. Much of this work was carried out
together with his friend, benefactor, and collaborator
g. h. hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947).
Hardy and Ramanujan founded the powerful “circle
method” in their remarkable paper that gave an exact
formula for p(n), the number of integer partitions of n.
Ramanujan independently discovered the two identi-
ties that came to be known as the Rogers–Ramanujan
identities:

number of partitions of n into parts all of which are
2 or 3 mod 5 is equal to the number of partitions into
distinct parts, all greater than 1, in which no two parts
are consecutive integers.
In his work on p(n), Ramanujan discovered and
proved many divisibility properties, e.g., that 5 always
divides p(5 n + 4) and that 7 always divides p(7 n + 6).
His conjectures on these divisibility properties inspired
the development of extensive methods in modular
in 1969 by Oliver Atkin.

The relevance of this is that q1/24 /η(w) is the generat-
ing function for p(n). Of special interest to Ramanujan
was the arithmetic function τ(n), defined by the 24 th
