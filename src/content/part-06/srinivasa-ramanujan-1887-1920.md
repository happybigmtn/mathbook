theorem and the Skolem paradox. Skolem had real-ized, long before anyone else, that mathematical theories nearly always have several different models. Heargued that there are axiom systems, and one can prove theorems in these settings, but what is meant by the objects that obey these rules will generally vary from case to case. From this he drew the radical conclu-sion that attempts to build mathematics on axiomatic theories were unlikely to succeed (although nowadays, of course, mathematics built on axiomatic foundations has become overwhelmingly successful).Skolem’s insistence on first-order theories, in which variables may range only over elements, not subsets, was one that his contemporaries took time to accept. But that viewpoint, and the great clarity that comes withit, is today the overwhelmingly dominant one. Skolem insisted that the only possible logic to use in any inves-tigation of the foundations of mathematics was firstorder logic [IV.22 §3.2](/part-04/set-theory), and that second-order theories were impermissible in the foundations, precisely because second-order theories allowed the axioms to refer to sets, but the nature of sets was, in his view, one of the topics to be elucidated. Skolem also felt that, while one can talk of individual objects, talk ofobjects of a certain kind can be problematic if it is tooall informal. Indeed, a generation earlier mathematicians had encountered the paradoxes of naive set theory, where loose talk about all sets of certain kinds causes real difficulties: for example, Russell’s paradox of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves (if itis a member of itself, then it is not, but if it is not, then it is).Skolem’s work is also characterized by a distrust of the concept of infinity and a preference for finitistic reasoning. He was an early advocate ofsion [II.4 §3.2.1](/part-02/algorithms), which deals with the theory of what primitive recurare called computable functions, as a way of avoiding paradoxes concerning the infinite.

for many of the breakthroughs in number theory inthe twentieth century. He worked on analytic number theory, as well as on hypergeometric series, and the theory ofelliptic functions continued[V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), fractions together with his friend, benefactor, and collaborator[III.22]. Much of this work was carried out g. h. hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947). method” in their remarkable paper that gave an exact formula for Hardy and Ramanujan founded the powerful “circlep(n), the number of integer partitions of n. Ramanujan independently discovered the two identi-ties that came to be known as the Rogers–Ramanujan identities:$\i\text{nf ty} ^{n}^{2}q$

1+(1 - q)(1 - q2) · · · (1 - qn)n=1 \infty=n = 0 (1 - (q5()n)+1)(1 1 - (q5()n)+4)$,\i\text{nf ty} (qn()2)+n$ 1+(1 - q)(1 - q2) · · · (1 - qn)n = 1\i\text{nf ty}= (1 - (q5()n)+2)(1 1 - (q5()n)+3).

These have applications ranging from$n = 0 \text{lie theory}$ [III.48](/part-03/lie-theory) to statistical physics. The importance of these identities relates to the fact that the generating function [[IV.18 §§2.4, 3]](/part-04/enumerative-and-algebraic-combinatorics) for$p(n) is \i\text{nf ty}$.$1$- qnn = 0

Thus, for example, the second identity asserts that thenumber of partitions ofn into parts all of which are 2 or 3 mod 5 is equal to the number of partitions into distinct parts, all greater than 1, in which no two parts are consecutive integers. proved many divisibility properties, e.g., that 5 always divides In his work onp(5 n + 4) \text{and that} 7 \text{always dividesp}(n), Ramanujan discovered andp(7 n + 6). His conjectures on these divisibility properties inspired the development of extensive methods in modular forms [III.59](/part-03/modular-forms), and his last conjecture was finally settled in 1969 by Oliver Atkin.All Ramanujan’s studies involvingp(n) concerned the modular form η(w) = (q1()/){2}4 n \infty=1(1 - qn), where q = e^2^π^i^w. The relevance of this is that(q1()/){2}4/η(w) \text{is the generat}- ing function forwas the arithmetic functionp(n). Of special interest to Ramanujanτ(n), defined by the 24 th
