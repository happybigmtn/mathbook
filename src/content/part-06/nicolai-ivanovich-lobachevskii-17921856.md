Astronomy; geometry; statics
Möbius was briefly a student of gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and
worked as an astronomer at Leipzig University for
almost all of his life. His finest mathematical work
was his Der barycentrische Calcul (1829), in which he
introduced algebraic methods into the study of pro-

jective geometry. He showed in this way how points
can be described by a homogeneous triple of coordin-
ates, lines can be described by linear equations, the con-
cept of cross-ratio can be introduced, and the duality
of points and lines in the plane can be handled alge-
bra ically. He also introduced a Möbius net, which is
the projective equivalent of squared paper in Cartesian
geometry. His work is all the more remarkable because
Möbius knew very little of Poncelet’s radical reinven-
tion of projective geometry only a few years before.
In its turn his work was for a time overshadowed by
Jakob Steiner’s synthetic treatment of projective geom-
etry of 1832, and then Plücker’s two books on algebraic
curves in the 1830 s, but the simplicity and generality
of Möbius’s methods were important in establishing
projective geometry as a rigorous mainstream subject.
  In the 1830 s Möbius developed a geometrical theory
of statics and the composition of forces, and it was in
this connection that he showed that where as duality in
plane geometry necessarily gives rise to a conic, duality    soon elected Rector of the University of Kazan, a post
in space need not. Möbius’s study of duality in space,
which pairs points with planes, led him to consider the
set of all lines in space, which is a four-dimensional
space. It pleased the educator Rudolf Steiner very much
that the ordinary three-dimensional space may also
be thought of as a four-dimensional space, because
Steiner’s philosophy was directed against breaking
what he saw as a stranglehold of orthodox teaching.

Möbius is also remembered for the “Möbius band”
(or möbius strip [IV.7 §2.3](/part-04/dierential-topology)), a one-sided or nonori-
en table surface, but the first mathematician to describe
such a surface was his compatriot J. B. Listing, in July
1858 (published in 1861). Möbius discovered it only in
of the most important mathematicians to study inver-
sion in circles, and his account of it in 1855 is one rea-
son that such transformations are often called Möbius
transformations.

Non-Euclidean geometry
Lobachevskii came from a poor background, but his
mother was able to have him enrolled at the local
Gymnasium (or high school) on a scholarship in 1800.
In 1805 the Gymnasium was made the kernel of the
new University of Kazan, and in 1807 Lobachevskii
began to study there. The university had just appointed
Martin Bartels as Professor of Mathematics, and Bar-
tels not only trained Lobachevskii well, but protected
him from trouble with the authorities when Lo bac hev-
skii was suspected of atheism. Eventually, Lo bac hev-
skii graduated not with the ordinary degree but with a
Master’s qualification, and his career as a professional
mathematician began.
In 1826, after a reform of the university, Lo bac hev-
skii gave a public lecture: “On the principles of geom-
etry, with a rigorous demonstration of the theory of
parallels.” The manuscript of this talk is now lost, but
it probably marked the start of Lobachevskii’s aware-
ness of a non-Euclidean geometry. Lobachevskii was
he occupied with distinction for thirty years, helping to
protect the university from a cholera epidemic in 1830,
to rebuild it after a fire in 1841, and generally to expand
its library and other facilities.
In the 1830 s he also wrote his major works, on a
geometry different in only one respect from Euclid-
ean geometry. He called it imaginary geometry and it
is known today as non-Euclidean geometry. In the new
