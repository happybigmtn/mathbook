following important lemma. If a property M does not
apply to all values of a variable x but does apply for all    a sequence of partition sums, its continuity in terms of
values smaller than a certain u, then there is always a
quantity U , which is the greatest of those of which it can   ment and of its corresponding values, and the sum of
be asserted that all smaller x possess the property M.
The value u in this formulation is a lower bound for the
(nonempty) set of numbers with the property not-M.
Bolzano’s lemma is therefore equivalent to what nowa-
days might be called the “greatest lower bound” axiom
(or, more commonly and equivalently, the “least upper
bound” axiom). It is also equivalent to the Bolzano–
Weierstrass theorem (that every bounded infinite set in
R, or more generally Rn , has an accumulation point). It
is likely that weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) independently redis-
covered the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, but it is also
likely that he knew, and was influenced by, Bolzano’s
proof technique of iterated bisection (used by Bolzano
in 1817).
   In the early 1830 s it was widely believed that a con-
tinuous function must be differentiable except at some
isolated points. But at that time Bolzano constructed
a counterexample (although he did not publish it), and
proved that it was such—more than thirty years before
the well-known counterexample due to Weierstrass.
   Bolzano had a surprising variety of insights and suc-
cessful proof techniques that were well ahead of their
time: notably in analysis, topology, dimension theory,
and set theory.

Trained as a roads and bridges engineer at the École
Polytechnique (here after, “EP”) and the École des Ponts
et Chaussées (1805–10), Cauchy passed his career as an
academic at the EP and the Paris Faculté des Sciences of
the Université de France until 1830, when he left France
with the deposed royal family after the revolution of
that year. He returned only in 1838, and later taught in
the Paris Faculté.
   Of Cauchy’s many contributions to pure and applied
mathematics, the best known are in mathematical anal-
ysis. In the foundations of real variables, he replaced
all previous approaches to the theory with one that
(in more developed forms) has now become standard:
(i) lay down an explicit theory of limits; (ii) formulate     of group theory; algebraic number theory; perturb a-
definitions carefully, and in general terms; (iii) define
the derivative of a function as the limiting value of the     paper of 1829 on quadratic forms, which could have

difference quotient, its integral as the limiting value of
the joint passage to limits of any sequence of its argu-
a convergent infinite series as the limiting value of its
partial sums. A key ingredient in all this was the idea
that (iv) limits may not exist: their existence has to be
justified carefully. Similarly, (v) the existence of solu-
tions to differential equations has to be proved, not just
assumed.
This approach brought a new level of rigor to analy-
sis; for example, for the first time the fundamental
theorem of calculus [I.3 §5.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) was a genuine theo-
rem, governed by conditions on the function. However,
this emphasis on limits made the theory hard for begin-
ners: it was not liked by staff or students at the EP,
where he taught it in this form between 1816 and 1830
and published it extensively, especially in his Cours
d’Analyse (1821) and his Résumé (1823) of the calcu-
lus. Its rise to standard educational practice was very
gradual, both in France and elsewhere.
Another major innovation of Cauchy dates from
1814, when he began to create complex-variable analy-
sis. Initially the integrand was a complex function but
the limits of integration were real; however, from 1825
on they too became complex, and in this form he
found many theorems on the residues of functions
over closed domains of various shapes. Unusually for
him, his progress was fitful, and he cast the theory

He also studied the general theory of complex func-
tions, including their expansion in power series of
various kinds.
Cauchy’s main single achievement in applied mathe-
matics lies in linear elasticity theory, where in the 1820 s
he used stress–strain models to analyze the behav-
ior of various kinds of surfaces and solids; later he
adapted it to study aspects of (aetherian) optics. In
the 1810 s he studied deep-body fluid dynamics, where
he found Fourier-integral solutions. In this and several
other areas he was in some competition with Fourier
and, especially, Poisson, regarding both the quality of
the theory and the chronology of its development.
Cauchy’s other contributions lie in basic mechan-
ics (derived from the EP teaching); singular and gen-
eral solutions of differential equations; the theory of
equations, especially methods that helped in the rise
tion theory in celestial mechanics; and an astounding
