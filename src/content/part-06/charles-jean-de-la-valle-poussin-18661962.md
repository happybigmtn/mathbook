this, see operator algebras [IV.15 §1](/part-04/operator-algebras).) The equa-
tions arise in the context of problems of mathematical
physics, e.g., in potential theory and in the theory of
oscillations. Fredholm considered himself primarily a
mathematical physicist, and his colleague Mittag-Leffler
tried in vain to have him awarded the Nobel Prize for
physics.

Analytic number theory; analysis
De la Vallée Poussin graduated in engineering (1890)
and mathematics (1891) from the Université Catholique
de Louvain, where he went on to teach mathematical
analysis from 1891 until 1951. His lectures formed
the basis for his renowned Cours d’Analyse Infinitési-
male, which ran to many editions from 1903 to 1959.
A member of the most famous academies in Europe
and the United States, with honorary doctorates from
Paris, Strasbourg, Toronto, and Oslo, he was the first
president (1920) of the International Union of Mathe-
maticians (now the International Mathematical Union).
He was made a baron in 1930.
  De la Vallée Poussin’s main achievement was his
proof in 1896 of the prime number theorem [V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860)
(an asymptotic estimate for the distribution of prime
numbers in the integers), first conjectured by gauss
[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) in around 1793. (The theorem was also proved
independently by hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) in the same year,
also using complex function theory.) Shortly afterward,     Butzer, P., J. Mawhin, and P. Vetro, eds. 2000–4. Charles-
de la Vallée Poussin followed his proof with a sharper
error term (1899), which he extended to prime numbers
in an arithmetic progression.
  When lebesgue [VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941) first published his inte-
gral [III.55](/part-03/measures) in 1902, de la Vallée Poussin immediately
grasped its importance and, using an original approach,
described it in the second edition of his Cours d’Analyse   VI.68
(1908). In addition, he introduced the concept of the
characteristic function of a set (1915), and shortly
afterward gave a decomposition theorem for the mea-
sure generated by a continuous function of bounded
variation (1916).
  Of particular importance for approximation theory
and the summation of series is de la Vallée Poussin’s
convolution integral (1908), for approximating peri-
odic functions by trigonometric polynomials. His other
significant results in this field include a lower bound
for the error in the best approximation of a contin-
uous function by a polynomial (1910), and a conver-

gence test and a summation method for Fourier series
(1918).
In 1911 de la Vallée Poussin was responsible for sug-
gesting the Belgian Academy prize question that led to
Jackson’s and Bernstein’s theorems on the order of the
best approximation of a continuous function by poly-
nomials. His existence and uniqueness theorem for the
Chebyshev problem for an over determined system of

ear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm); his interpolation formula
(1908) was fundamental for sampling theory; and his
character ization of new classes of quasi-analytic func-
tions by the rate of decrease of their Fourier coefficients
(1915) was a not able development.
De la Vallée Poussin’s other achievements include
determining a uniqueness condition for multipoint
boundary-value problems (1929), which was a sig-
nif i cant result for the study of nonoscillatory solu-
tions of linear differential equations; and solving var-
ious problems of the conformal representation of
multiply connected regions (1930–31). In potential
theory he extended the concept of capacity to arbi-
trary bounded sets, proved his extraction theorem for
bounded sequences of set functions, and, by intro duc-
ing measure theory into poincaré’s [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) “méthode
de balayage” (“sweeping-out method”) for the dirich-
let problem [IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis), he paved the way for modern
abstract potential theory.

b. Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), 1868;
d. Bonn, Germany, 1942
Set theory; topology
Hausdorff studied mathematics at Leipzig, Freiburg,
and Berlin between 1887 and 1891, and then started
research in applied mathematics at Leipzig under Hein-
rich Bruns. After his habilitation (1895) he taught first
at Leipzig and then later at Bonn (1910–13, 1921–35)
and Greifswald (1913–21). He is best known for his
work in set theory and general topology, his magnum
opus being Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (“Basic fea-
tures of set theory”). It was published in 1914 and
