# Norbert Wiener (1894–1964)

VI.85.    Norbert Wiener

the banach–tarski paradox [V.3](/part-05/the-banachtarski-paradox) show how wide his
influence has been. Banach also introduced the notions
of dual space [III.19](/part-03/duality), dual operator, and the general
concepts of weak and weak-star convergence, and he
used all of these notions in linear operator equations.
  In 1936, Banach delivered a one-hour plenary address
at the International Congress of Mathematicians in
Oslo, where he described the work of the whole Lwów
school. In 1937 Norbert Wiener tried to lure him to
the United States. In 1939 he was elected president
of the Polish Mathematical Society and was awarded
a Grand Prize of the Polish Academy of Knowledge.
Banach spent the war years in Lwów. During the years
1940–41 and 1944–45 he was the Dean of the Faculty
of Science at the renamed Iwan Franko State University.
In the period 1941–44 Lwów was occupied by the Ger-
man army. During this period Banach was saved from
almost certain death by the action of Rudolf Weigel,
a “Schindleresque” factory owner and invent or of the
typhus vaccine, who gave him employment at his Bac-
teriological Institute as a louse feeder. After the war, he
accepted a chair at the Jagiellonian University. He died
on August 31, 1945, in Lwów of lung cancer at the age
of fifty-three.
  The complete list of Banach’s publications comprises
fifty-eight items, and they were reprinted in Banach’s
Collected Works (published in two volumes in 1967 and
1979). Banach said, “Mathematics is the most beauti-
ful and most powerful creation of the human spirit.
Mathematics is as old as Man.” Banach is considered a
national hero in Poland, as a great scientist and a major
figure in the great flowering of Polish scientific life in
the independent Poland of the interwar years.

Wiener was just eighteen years old when, in 1913, he
was awarded a Ph. D. in logic while studying under
Josiah Royce at Harvard University. Afterward, he stud-
ied with, among others, russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970) and hardy
[VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947) in Cambridge and hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) in Göttingen.

After doing work on ballistics for the military during
World War II, he was appointed instructor of mathemat-
ics at the fledgling Massachusetts Institute of Tech nol-
ogy in Cambridge, MA, where he remained for the rest
of his career.
Wiener was in many respects a nonconformist, cer-
tainly scientifically and mathematically, but also social-
ly, culturally, politically, and philosophically. He was a
precocious child and his home education by his father
(a noted linguist and Harvard professor), along with his
Jewish background in a society still stricken by anti-
Semi tism, made his nonconformism almost inevitable.
Garrett Birkhoff, the son of george birkhoff [VI.78](/part-06/george-birkho-18841944),
said the following in 1977:
Wiener was not able as one of the few Americans of
his time who was outstanding in both pure mathe-
matics and its applications. How much of this can be
attributed to his varied and cosmopolitan early back-
ground, and how much to his continuing contacts with
non-mathematicians ... it is hard to say.
During a period in which American mathematics was
largely self-sufficient and was still in a phase in which
interdisciplina ry approaches were generally ignored,
Wiener was reaching out to European mathematics and
collaborating with engineers such as Vannevar Bush.
This attitude also affected his choices of research
topics, even within pure mathematics: he worked on
whatever took his fancy. In a talk in 1938, George
Birkhoff described Wiener’s work on Tauberian the-
orems as an example of “exercising talent for free
invention,” contrasting this with the typically American
approach: “mathematics as serious business.”
Wiener’s way of connecting pure and applied math-
ematics did not follow the usual path of taking old
problems of applied mathematics (such as in classi-
cal mechanics and electrical engineering) and tack-
ling them with new, and rigorously sharpened, mathe-
Lech Maligranda
mat ical tools. Rather the opposite: Wiener used some
of the newest, and much debated, results of pure
Norbert Wiener
Fourier transformations in the complex domain, and
stochastic processes [IV.24](/part-04/stochastic-processes)—and connected them
to several of the newest physical, technological, and
biological problems. The types of problem he attacked
included those of brownian motion [IV.24](/part-04/stochastic-processes), quantum
mechanics, radio astronomy, anti-aircraft fire control,
noise filtration in radar, the nervous system, and the
theory of automata.
