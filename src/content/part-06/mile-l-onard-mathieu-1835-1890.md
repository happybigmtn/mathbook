a geometric setting for complex function theory that, as Ahlfors’s own work indicates, remains fertile over 150 years after it was written.

b. Brunswick, Germany, 1831; d. Brunswick, Germany, 1916 Algebraic number theory; algebraic curves; set theory; foundations of mathematics Dedekind spent most of his life as a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Brunswick, Germany (his andgauss’s [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) home town), having spent the years 1858–62 at the Polytechnikum in Zürich (which later became known as ETH). He obtained his mathematical education at Göttingen, being Gauss’s last Ph. D. student and subsequently a pupil ofand riemann [VI.49].
Dedekind was a retiring man dirichlet [VI.36] with, ashe remained a bachelor, living with his mother andklein [VI.57] said, a “contemplative nature;” sister. Nevertheless, he had an impact upon a select group of contemporaries (especially frobenius [VI.58](/part-06/ferdinand-georg-frobenius-18491917), and Heinrich Weber) through hiscantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), rich correspondence.

Indeed, he shaped mod-[I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). His main contribution, however, was ern number theory as we know it, presenting it as atheory of ideals in rings of integers (see algebraic numbers [[IV.1 §§4–7]](/part-04/algebraic-numbers)).
This was first made public in 1871, within Supplement X to his edition of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, where he established unique decomposition of ideals into prime ideals for all rings of algebraic integers. In the process, he for-mulated the concepts of field, ring, ideal, and module (see [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)), always within the par-ticular context of the complex numbers. It was also in the context of algebra (Galois theory) and num-ber theory that Dedekind started systematic work with

(1879 and 1894) Dedekind went on refining his pre-In subsequent editions of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen sentation of ideal theory, making it more purely set-theoretic. In 1882, together with Weber, he offered a theory of ideals in fields of algebraic functions, whichmade it possible to give a rigorous treatment of Riemann’s results on algebraic curves up to theroch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). This work paved the way for riemann modern algebraic geometry.

In 1858 (published1872) he formulated a definition of the real numbers using what are now known as “Dedekind cuts” in the set of rational numbers. During the 1870 s (published1888) he elaborated a purely set-theoretic definition of the natural numbers as “simply infinite” sets, whichled him to crystallize the dedekind–peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms).
In this work, as in his more advanced research, sets, structures, and mappings form the essential building blocks, the very foundations of pure mathematics. In the light of (now superseded) conceptions of logic, this led Dedekind to the view that “arithmetic (algebra, analysis) is only a part of logic.” From a modern viewpoint, his contributions show that set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) is a sufficient foundation for classical mathematics. Thus he contributed as much as anybody else to the set-theoretic reformulation of modern mathematics.
