Like many who aspired to enter the École Poly tech-
nique, Hermite under took special preparatory classes,
in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand.
He began to study serious mathematics, immersing
himself in the work of lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen-
dre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution of
equations by radicals. Admitted to the École Poly tech-
nique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed
his first significant original work. This extended results
of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions
[V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very
positively. This achievement both brought him recogni-
tion in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobi
on elliptic functions and number theory that launched
Hermite’s career.
   Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position
commensurate with his abilities, and for almost a
decade survived on teaching assistant and examiner
jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number
theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms,
where he followed gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study-
ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear
transformation. It was in this context that the hermi-
tian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) named after him arose. Her-
mite was interested in invariants of quadratic forms,
and also applied his work to the problem of location
of roots of polynomials. As a result of these efforts,
in 1856 he was appointed to the Paris Academy of Sci-
ences, with liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) sup-
port ing him. This appointment was quickly followed
by Hermite’s 1858 discovery of a means to express the
solutions of the general fifth-degree polynomial equa-
tion in terms of elliptic functions, which earned him
widespread international recognition.
   Finally obtaining a professorship at the Faculty of Sci-
ence in Paris in 1869, Hermite became an influential
mentor for a generation of mathematicians, his best-
known protégés including J. Tannery, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912),

E. Picard, P. Appell, and E. Goursat. Hermite’s dynas-
tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law,
Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris
Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell
married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-

the transcendence [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) of “e” using continued-
approximation theory (which had included the inven-
tion of the Hermite polynomials). His influence in the
mathematical community was strong until his death.

Algebra; number theory
One of the dominant mathematicians of the second
half of the nineteenth century, Kronecker is best known
today for his constructivist views and his contributions
to number theory. After finishing his Ph. D. under the
supervision of dirichlet [VI.36] in 1845, Kronecker
left Berlin and mathematics in order to manage a fam-
ily estate and to wind up his father-in-law’s banking
business. These activities left him wealthy and free
to return to Berlin and concentrate on mathematics
with out holding an academic position. In 1855, Kro-
necker’s former school teacher and closest scientific
friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to
Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861,
Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of
Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin Univer-
sity. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-
leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897))
highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and
Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to
bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about
Kronecker. After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kro-
necker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his
teaching activities as well as the frequency of his pub-
lications. This last active period was cut short when he
died, shortly after the death of his wife.

   Kronecker was renowned for the originality of his
mathematical insight and became increasingly influ-
ential through the 1860 s and 1870 s. In 1868, he was
offered the chair at Göttingen formerly held by gauss
[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and was elected to the Paris Academy. After the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870–71, he was invited to rec-
ommend mathematicians for the newly opened German
university in Strasbourg; and in 1880 he became the
managing editor of the Journal für die reine und ange-
wandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Crelle’s Jour-
nal). He was often criticized for incomplete, unpub-
lished, or incomprehensible proofs—jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922)
spoke of his colleagues’ “envy and despair” with regard     ing with polynomials modulo an irreducible equation

prompted hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) to call Kronecker a “Ver-
botsdiktator” (“forbidding dictator”). Generally affable
and hospitable, Kronecker was tough in defending his
mathematical ideas and his claims to priority.
   In his first works on solvable algebraic equations
(in the early 1850 s), he claimed not only the so-
called Kronecker–Weber theorem (in today’s formula-

1900, is today part of class field theory [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871) and
the theory of complex multiplication. Such connections
between algebra, analysis, and arithmetic continued
to pervade Kronecker’s later work. Important results
of Kronecker include class number relations and limit
formulas in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem),
the structure theorem for finitely generated Abelian
groups, and a theory of bilinear forms.
   In the late 1850 s, Kronecker began to work on alge-
braic number theory, but only in 1881 did he pub-
lish his “Grundzüge einer arithmetischen The orie der

to Dedekind’s notion of “ideal” in the case of Dedekind
domains, but is more restricted in the general case. Sev-
eral mathematicians, such as H. Weber, K. Hensel, and
G. König, took up the “Grundzüge” in their own work.
On a more general level, Kronecker asked for the
complete arithmetization of pure mathematics, i.e., for
the effective finitary reduction of pure mathematics
to the notion of positive integer. For this, he propa-
gated the introduction of indeterminates and equiv-
alence relations, a method which he traced back to
Gauss. In the case of a finite extension of the rational
numbers, for instance, Kronecker is explicitly work-

No mathematician is more associated with the mid-
nineteenth-century transition from algorithmic to con-
ceptual thought than Riemann. His doctoral thesis of
1851, and still more his paper on Abelian functions
(1857), promoted the view that a holomorphic func-
tion [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) is properly defined by the cauchy–
riemann equations [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and is to be studied
through a close connection with the theory of har-
[V.34](/part-05/the-uniformization-theorem). This states that if X and Y are any two simply
connected open subsets in the complex plane, neither
of which is the whole plane, then there is a holomor-
phic map from one to the other with a holomorphic

the plane that does not intersect itself, and let D be
the region inside the curve, then D is biholomorphi-
cally equivalent to the open unit disk. In the 1857 paper
he defined riemann surfaces [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces), showed how to
analyze them topologically, and outlined the Riemann
inequality which his student Gustav Roch improved
to the riemann–roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) in 1864. (The
Riemann–Roch theorem, which is of great importance
in algebraic geometry as well as complex analysis,
determines the dimension of the space of meromor-
phic functions on a given Riemann surface with a pre-
scribed number of poles.) In 1857 he extended the
theory of differential equations, specifically the impor-
tant case of the hypergeometric equation, to complex
functions. In 1859 he used deep, new ideas from com-
plex function theory to study the (Riemann) zeta func-
tion and proposed his celebrated conjecture, the rie-
mann hypothesis [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), concerning the location
of the complex zeros of this function. The conjecture
remains unsolved to this day.
   These ideas enabled mathematicians to study com-
plex functions on domains other than the plane and
subsets of the plane. They opened the way to a geomet-
ric study of algebraic functions and algebraic curves,
and proved to be decisive in the study of the integrals of   of “almost cryptic messages to the future” and said
algebraic functions (the theories of Abelian functions
and theta functions of several variables). Investigations    “would defy any attempt at proof, even with modern
of the Riemann zeta function led not only to the dis-
covery of new properties of classes of complex func-

tions, but more recently to the use of zeta functions
of many other kinds in other branches of mathematics,
including dynamics.
In 1854 Riemann, inspired by his mentor dirich-
let [VI.36], formulated the concept of the riemann
integral [I.3 §5.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), which permitted him to do pro-
found work on the convergence of trigonometric series.
Dirichlet had been able to prove that a real function
was correctly represented by a Fourier series, but only
under very restrictive conditions. This left open the
questions of what sorts of functions did not satisfy
these conditions and how could they be studied. Rie-
mann reformulated the concept of the integral and was
able to show that it is not just the continuity of a func-
tion and the ways in which it may fail to be continuous
that affect the accuracy of its Fourier series re pre sen-
tation, but the nature of its oscillations. The Riemann
integral remained the dominant definition of the inte-
Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann
[III.55](/part-03/measures) after 1902, which is better adapted to capturing
the way the behavior of a function affects its Fourier
series.
In a lecture, also given in 1854 (but published posthu-
mously in 1868), he entirely reformulated geometry as
being about spaces (sets of points, which he called man-
ifolds [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) with a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)
(an appropriate concept of distance) and argued that
the geometric properties of a space were its intrinsic
ones. He noted that there are three constant-curvature
spaces in two dimensions and showed how the idea of
constant curvature can be extended to higher dimen-
sions. In passing, he was the first person to write down a
metric for non-Euclidean geometry (more than a decade
before Beltrami’s publication of 1868, which legit-
imized non-Euclidean geometry). This lecture earned
him the right to teach in a German university.
Riemann also did important work on shock waves,
and shares with weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) the honor of intro-
ducing the methods of complex function theory in the
study of minimal surfaces [III.94 §3.1](/part-03/variational-methods), where he was
led to several new solutions of the Plateau problem,
which asks for the surface of least area spanning a
given curve in space.

described Riemann’s complex analysis as consisting
