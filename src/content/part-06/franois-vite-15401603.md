# François Viète (1540–1603)

VI.9. François Viète

VI.6     Leonardo of Pisa

b. Pisa, Italy, ca. 1170; d. Pisa, Italy, ca. 1250
Son of Pisan merchant; studied mathematics under Muslim teachers
in North Africa and traveled through out the Mediterranean meeting
with Islamic scholars; awarded an annual stipend in 1240 by the city   later Bishop of Melfi
of Pisa in recognition of his teaching and other services

One of the earliest European writers on algebra, Fibo-
nacci is most famous for his Liber Abaci (“Book of cal-
culation”), which first appeared in 1202 and was largely
responsible for the spread of the Hindu–Arabic numer-
als through out Europe. The book contained not only
rules for computing with the Hindu–Arabic numerals
but also a large number of problems of various kinds,
the best known of which was his “rabbit problem.” This
problem asks how many pairs of rabbits will be pro-
duced in a year, beginning with a single pair, if in every
month each pair produces a new pair which becomes
productive from the second month on. The number Fn
of pairs there will be in the nth month is the num-
ber of pairs there were in the previous month plus the
number of breeding pairs, and the latter is the num-
ber of rabbits there were in the previous month but
one. This leads to the rule Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 . Start-
ing with F0 = 0 and F1 = 1, we obtain the sequence
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . of Fibonacci numbers. It can be
shown that limn→. nfty Fn+1 /Fn = φ, where φ = (1+ 5)/2
is the golden ratio.
VI.7     Girolamo Cardano
b. Pavia, Italy, 1501; d. Rome, 1576
Teacher of mathematics, Milan (1534–43); Professor of Medicine:
Pavia (1543–60), Bologna (1562–70); imprisoned for heresy (1570–71)
Cardano’s great treatise, the Ars Magna (1545), laid the
foundations for European algebra and remained the
most comprehensive and systematic work on algebra
for more than a century after it was published. It con-
tained many new ideas, including methods (not all Car-
dano’s own) for solving cubic and quartic equations,
all written with out mathematical notation. Cardano’s
own great insight was to recognize the existence of
relations between the roots and the coefficients of an
equation; in this he was unprecedented. He also showed
a greater readiness than most of his contemporaries
to contemplate the square roots of negative numbers.
He is remembered today for “Cardano’s rule” for solv-
ing cubic equations of the form x 3 + cx = d, where

737
c and d are positive (he was unable to solve the casus
irreducibilis, the case when c is negative).
(known as Fibonacci)
VI.8      Rafael Bombelli
b. Bologna, Italy, 1526; d. Probably Rome, after 1572
Engineer–architect for the Roman nobleman Alessandro Rufini,
Bombelli was prompted to write his Algebra (1572) by
a desire to make cardano’s [VI.7](/part-06/girolamo-cardano-15011576) Ars Magna (1545)
accessible to the less sophisticated reader. The Alge-
bra, which contains a systematic treatment of quadrat-
ics, cubics, and quartics, is noted for its advances in
mathematical notation—it was the first printed text to
include a notation for exponents—and for its role in
disseminating awareness of the work of Diophantus.
Above all, the Algebra was renowned for solving cer-
tain special cases of the so-called casus irreducibilis of
the cubic, those in which Cardano’s rule appears to give
rise to a complex or “impossible” solution. Cardano was
aware that what we today call complex numbers (num-
√
bers of the form a + b −1) could arise in the solution
of quadratic equations. Bombelli made the important
discovery that what at first sight appears to be a com-
plex root of a cubic equation may in fact be a real root,
because the imaginary parts cancel each other out. The
Algebra included the first extensive discussion of com-
plex numbers and Bombelli formulated the four basic
√              operations of arithmetic for them.
VI.9      François Viète
b. Fontenay-le-Comte, France, 1540; d. Paris, 1603
Trigonometry; algebraic analysis; classical problems;
numerical solution of equations
Viète obtained a bachelor’s degree in law in 1560 from
the University of Poitiers, but left the profession from
1564 to 1568 to over see the education of Catherine
de Parthenay, daughter of a local aristocratic family. His
earliest scientific writings were his lectures to Cather-
ine. He spent the remainder of his life in high pub-
lic office, apart from a period between 1584 and 1589
when he was banished from the court in Paris for polit-
ical and religious reasons. He died in Paris in 1603.
Through out his life, it was only during the time he
had free from official duties that he was able to devote
himself to mathematics.
The work for which Viète is best known appeared
during the 1590 s, beginning with In Artem Analyticem
Isagoge (“Introduction to the analytic art”) in 1591.
In the Isagoge Viète began to combine classical Greek
