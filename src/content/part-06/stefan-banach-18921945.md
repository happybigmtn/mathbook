affectionately known as the “Yellow Peril.” The third volume in this series is Courant’s exposition of riemann’s [VI.49] geometric view of the theory of analytic functions, combined with Hurwitz’s lectures on elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). In 1924 the first volume of Courant-Hilbert on Mathematical Physics appeared; it contained, presciently, much of the mathematics needed for Schrödinger’s version of quantum mechanics. His influential calculus book appeared in 1927 . His research did not languish;
in 1928 he published, jointly with his students Friedrichs and Lewy, the basic paper on the difference equations of mathematical physics. Under Courant’s leadership, Göttingen, where the lively international atmosphere had been destroyed by World War I, became once again an important center for mathematics, as well as physics: the list of visitors reads like a Who’s Who of mathematics. This was totally shattered when Hitler took over the government: Jewish professors, Courant among the first, were dismissed unceremoniously and had to flee or face annihilation.
Courant and his family found refuge in New York, where he was invited to build a Graduate School of Mathematics at New York University (NYU). With out any foundation to build on, Courant succeeded in this task, with the help of his former student Friedrichs and of the American James Stoker, who shared Courant’s scientific ideals. Courant found New York a reservoir of talent, and attracted students such as Max Shiffman, and later Harold Grad, Joe Keller, Martin Kruskal, Cathleen Morawetz, Louis Nirenberg, and others, including the writer of this article.
In 1936 , in a burst of creativity, Courant obtained several basic results about minimal surfaces [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods) using Dirichlet’s principle. In 1937 he finished the second volume of Courant-Hilbert. The immensely successful popular book he wrote jointly with Herb Robbins, What Is Mathematics?, appeared in 1940 . In 1942 when federal financing for scientific research became available, Courant’s group embarked on an ambitious study of supersonic flow and shock waves. Federal support did not stop after the war;
this enabled Courant to vastly expand the scale of research and graduate instruction at NYU. The research combined, at a high intellectual level, theoretical mathematics with applications such as fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, the theory of elasticity, meteorology, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, and other topics. Nothing like this had been attempted before at a university in the United States. The institute created by Courant, eventually named after him, is

flourishing today and has served as a model for other centers around the world. Courant hated the Nazis, but did not condemn all Germans; after the war he helped to rebuild mathematics in Germany and was instrumental in inviting talented young German mathematicians and physicists to the United States.
Courant received much help from friends of his youth, many of whom became leaders in their fields, as well as from science administrators in government and industry who admired his vision of mathematics and the gallant spirit that was demonstrated by his willingness to fight against seemingly insuperable odds.

Stefan Banach

b. Kraków, Poland, 1892 ;  d. Lwów, Poland, 1945 Functional analysis; real analysis; measure theory; orthogonal series; set theory; topology Banach was the son of Katarzyna Banach and Stefan Greczek. As his parents were unmarried and his mother was too poor to support her son, he was brought up mainly in Kraków by a foster mother, Franciszka Płowa. After graduating from high school in 1910 , Banach enrolled at the Lwów Polytechnic in the Faculty of Engineering.
Two years after his studies were interrupted by the out break of World War I, Banach returned to Kraków, where on a summer evening in 1916 he was “discovered” by Hugo Steinhaus, who over heard the words “Lebesgue integral” and brought him to Lwów. Steinhaus considered this event as his “greatest mathematical discovery.” It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus, whom he married in 1920 . In the same year Professor Antoni Łomnicki engaged Banach as his assistant at the Lwów Polytechnic, even though Banach had not yet finished his studies.
This was the beginning of the meteoric rise of Banach’s scientific career. In June 1920 Banach defended his doctoral dissertation, “On operations on abstract sets and their application to integral equations,” at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów. His dissertation was written in Polish and published in 1922 in French. In his thesis Banach introduced the concept of complete normed linear spaces,

which are today known as banach spaces [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces) (the
name was proposed by Fréchet in 1928). The theory
combined the contributions of riesz [VI.74](/part-06/frigyes-frdric-riesz-18801956), Volterra,
fredholm [VI.66](/part-06/ivar-fredholm-18661927), Lévy, and hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) on con-
crete spaces and on integral equations into a general
theory. Banach’s dissertation could be viewed as the
birth of functional analysis, since Banach spaces are one
of its central objects of study.
   On April 17, 1922, the Jan Kazimierz University in
Lwów awarded Banach his habilitation (a degree allow-
ing him to teach at the university), after which he was
appointed Docent in Mathematics. On July 22, 1922,
he became a professor of the university (and a full
professor from 1927). Banach achieved great research
results and became an authority in functional analy-
sis and measure theory [III.55](/part-03/measures). During the academic
year 1924–25 Banach was on sabbatical leave in Paris,
where he met lebesgue [VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941), who became a lifelong
friend.
   In Lwów a group of talented young mathematicians
around Banach and Steinhaus soon became the Lwów
School of Mathematics and started the journal Stu-
dia Mathematica in 1929. Among the members of this
school were S. Mazur, S. Ulam, W. Orlicz, J. P. Schauder,   algebra (published in the years 1930–36 and reprinted
H. Auerbach, M. Kac, S. Kaczmarz, S. Ruziewicz, and
W. Nikliborc. Banach also collaborated with Steinhaus,
Saks, and Kuratowski. Many of these mathematicians
were later killed by the Germans during the occupation
of Poland.
   In 1932, Banach’s famous book Theory of Linear
Operations appeared in French (a Polish version was
published the year before) as part of a new series of
mathematical monographs, of which he was one of the
founders. This was the first monograph on functional
analysis as an independent discipline, and it was the
culmination of more than a decade of intense activity
by Banach and others.
   Banach and the mathematicians around him liked
to discuss mathematics in the Café Szkocka (“Scottish
café”). This unconventional way of doing mathemat-
ics made the atmosphere of Lwów unique—it is one
of the rare cases in mathematics of genuine teamwork
among a large group. Turowicz and Ulam noted that
(see Kaluza 1996, pp. 62, 74):
  Banach liked to spend most of his days in a café. He
  liked the noise and the music. They did not prevent
  him from concentrating and thinking. It was difficult to
  out last or out drink Banach during these sessions. Prob-   the Banach–Mazur game, the Banach–Mazur distance
  lems posed right there were discussed, often with no
  solution evident even after several hours of thinking.    ach–Saks property, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, and

VI. Mathematicians
The next day Banach was likely to appear with several
small sheets of paper containing out lines of proofs he
had completed.
One day in 1935, Banach proposed that the open prob-
lems should be collected in a notebook. This notebook
later became famous under the name “The Scottish
Book.” In the years 1935–41 over 190 problems from
various branches of mathematical analysis were pro-
posed in this notebook, and the collection was pub-
lished in English in 1957 by Ulam. A version with
commentaries was published in 1981 by Birkhäuser as
The Scottish Book, Mathematics from the Scottish Café
(edited by R. D. Mauldin).
Banach was also the author of the books Mechanics
(in two volumes, 1929 and 1930; English translation
in 1951), Differential and Integral Calculus (in two vol-
umes, 1929 and 1930, with several editions in Polish),
Introduction to the Theory of Real Functions (in two vol-
umes, written by Banach before the war, although only
the first volume remains), and ten textbooks (jointly
written with Stożek and sierpiński [VI.77](/part-06/wacaw-sierpinski-18821969)) for primary
and secondary schools on arithmetic, geometry, and
in 1944–47).
Banach’s famous discoveries in functional analysis
had three important steps. First, he considered abstract
linear spaces, where functions are treated like points
or vectors, sets of functions as function spaces, and
operations on functions as operators. Second, he intro-
duced the norm  ·  of a mathematical object, that
is, a quantity that in some (possibly abstract) sense
describes the length, size, or extent of the object. The
distance between two abstract elements x and y is then
given naturally by d(x, y) = x − y. The third impor-
tant step was to introduce the notion of “complete-
ness” for these spaces. In such general spaces (Banach
spaces) he was able to prove several fundamental the-
orems, like the uniform boundedness principle, the
open mapping theorem, and the closed graph theorem.
What these results say, roughly speaking, is that in a
Banach space we cannot have bad (pathological) behav-
ior every where—there is always some part of the space
where our linear map or other object is well-behaved.
