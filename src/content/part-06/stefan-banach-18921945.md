affectionately known as the “Yellow Peril.” The third volume in this series is Courant’s exposition of riemann’s [VI.49] geometric view of the theory of analytic functions, combined with Hurwitz’s lectures on elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). In 1924 the first volume of Courant-Hilbert on Mathematical Physics appeared; it contained, presciently, much of the mathematics needed for Schrödinger’s version of quantum mechanics. His influential calculus book appeared in 1927 . His research did not languish;
in 1928 he published, jointly with his students Friedrichs and Lewy, the basic paper on the difference equations of mathematical physics. Under Courant’s leadership, Göttingen, where the lively international atmosphere had been destroyed by World War I, became once again an important center for mathematics, as well as physics: the list of visitors reads like a Who’s Who of mathematics. This was totally shattered when Hitler took over the government: Jewish professors, Courant among the first, were dismissed unceremoniously and had to flee or face annihilation.
Courant and his family found refuge in New York, where he was invited to build a Graduate School of Mathematics at New York University (NYU). Without any foundation to build on, Courant succeeded in this task, with the help of his former student Friedrichs and of the American James Stoker, who shared Courant’s scientific ideals. Courant found New York a reservoir of talent, and attracted students such as Max Shiffman, and later Harold Grad, Joe Keller, Martin Kruskal, Cathleen Morawetz, Louis Nirenberg, and others, including the writer of this article.
In 1936 , in a burst of creativity, Courant obtained several basic results about minimal surfaces [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods) using Dirichlet’s principle. In 1937 he finished the second volume of Courant-Hilbert. The immensely successful popular book he wrote jointly with Herb Robbins, What Is Mathematics?, appeared in 1940 . In 1942 when federal financing for scientific research became available, Courant’s group embarked on an ambitious study of supersonic flow and shock waves. Federal support did not stop after the war;
this enabled Courant to vastly expand the scale of research and graduate instruction at NYU. The research combined, at a high intellectual level, theoretical mathematics with applications such as fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, the theory of elasticity, meteorology, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, and other topics. Nothing like this had been attempted before at a university in the United States. The institute created by Courant, eventually named after him, is

flourishing today and has served as a model for other centers around the world. Courant hated the Nazis, but did not condemn all Germans; after the war he helped to rebuild mathematics in Germany and was instrumental in inviting talented young German mathematicians and physicists to the United States.
Courant received much help from friends of his youth, many of whom became leaders in their fields, as well as from science administrators in government and industry who admired his vision of mathematics and the gallant spirit that was demonstrated by his willingness to fight against seemingly insuperable odds.

Stefan Banach

b. Kraków, Poland, 1892 ;  d. Lwów, Poland, 1945 Functional analysis; real analysis; measure theory; orthogonal series; set theory; topology Banach was the son of Katarzyna Banach and Stefan Greczek. As his parents were unmarried and his mother was too poor to support her son, he was brought up mainly in Kraków by a foster mother, Franciszka Płowa. After graduating from high school in 1910 , Banach enrolled at the Lwów Polytechnic in the Faculty of Engineering.
Two years after his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, Banach returned to Kraków, where on a summer evening in 1916 he was “discovered” by Hugo Steinhaus, who overheard the words “Lebesgue integral” and brought him to Lwów. Steinhaus considered this event as his “greatest mathematical discovery.” It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus, whom he married in 1920 . In the same year Professor Antoni Łomnicki engaged Banach as his assistant at the Lwów Polytechnic, even though Banach had not yet finished his studies.
This was the beginning of the meteoric rise of Banach’s scientific career. In June 1920 Banach defended his doctoral dissertation, “On operations on abstract sets and their application to integral equations,” at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów. His dissertation was written in Polish and published in 1922 in French. In his thesis Banach introduced the concept of complete normed linear spaces,
