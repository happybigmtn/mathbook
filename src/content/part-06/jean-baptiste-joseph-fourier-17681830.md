# Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830)

VI.26.    Carl Friedrich Gauss

   For educational use Legendre produced Elements de
Géométrie (1794), an account of euclidean geometry
[I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) that emulated the same kind of form and orga-
nization and standards of proof of the Greek original.
He also handled aspects that had lain out side Euclid’s
concerns, such as alternatives to the parallel postulate,   appointed in the physical modeling. But Laplace also
related numerical issues such as approximations to the
value of π , and a lengthy summary of planar and spher-     tion for infinite bodies, which led Fourier to find, by
ical trigonometry. He produced eleven further editions
up to 1823 and there were further posthumous editions
up until 1839 (which were followed by reprints). It was     ly tique de la Chaleur (1822), which greatly influenced
a very influential book in mathematics education.

Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-
tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian
member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt
(1798–1801), important enough for the First Consul
to make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département
at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor
Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s. There after, Fourier
moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himself
to the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel     we now call it. Despite his prestige and advocacy, he
of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.
   The prefectureship involved heavy commitments,
and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably     few aspects of Laplace’s work on mathematical statis-
discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in
Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone
and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless,
between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his
scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical
study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid
bodies; his “diffusion equation” for this purpose was
not only novel in itself but also marked the first large-
scale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay
out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation
he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These
series were already known but had a low status. Fourier
(re)found many properties: not only the formulas for
their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-
gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how    Gauss’s prodigious mathematical abilities brought him
a periodic series could represent a general function. For   to the attention of the duke of Brunswick when he was

diffusion in a cylinder he found many properties of the
Bessel function J0 (x), which was then little studied.
Fourier presented his findings to the scientific class
of the Institut de France in 1807. lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813)
did not like the series, while laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) was dis-
gave him a clue about solutions of the diffusion equa-
1811, his integral solution (including in version) for
them. His main publication was the book Théorie Ana-
younger mathematicians: for example, the first sat-
is factory proof of the convergence of the series by
dirichlet [VI.36] (1829) and their use in fluid dynam-
ics by C. L. M. H. Navier (1825). Less happy was his
relationship with poisson [VI.27](/part-06/simon-denis-poisson-17811840), who tried to rederive
Ivor Grattan-Guinness   the entire theory following the molecularist physical
principles of Laplace and the methods of solution of
Lagrange, but only added a few special cases.
Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier
Fourier also worked on other topics in mathematics.
As a teenager he gave the first proof of descartes’s
[VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) rule of signs on the numbers of positive and
negative roots of a polynomial equation. (He used an
inductive proof that has now become standard.) He also
found an upper bound on the number of roots within a
given interval, which J. C. F. Sturm improved to an exact
evaluation in 1829. At that time Fourier was trying to
finish a book on equations, which appeared posthu-
mously in 1831 thanks to Navier. The main novelty was
the basic theory of linear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm), as
gained few followers (Navier was one), and the theory
lay dormant for over a century. Fourier also took up a
tics, examining the status of the normal distribution
[III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions).
