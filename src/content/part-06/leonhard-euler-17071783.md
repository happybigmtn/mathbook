# Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)

VI.19.   Leonhard Euler

   Johann’s correspondence with Leibniz (which spans
approximately twenty-five years) can be viewed as a lab-
oratory of mathematical invention and debate. The pri-
ority dispute that ensued when newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) accused
Leibniz of having stolen the calculus from him also
involved Johann, who fought on Leibniz’s side. With
each camp defying the other with difficult problems,
Johann had the opportunity to create, with his son Nico-
laus II, the theory of orthogonal trajectories of fami-
lies of curves. Johann was also a towering figure in the
origins of analytical mechanics and in mathematical
physics, where, among other things, he made not able
contributions to the study of central forces, to naviga-
tional theories, and to the question of the principles of
statics.
   Nicolaus I studied mathematics at the university of
Basel with his uncle Jacob before taking a degree of
Doctor of Jurisprudence (1709). He was the professor
of mathematics in Padua, occupying the chair once held
by Galileo, and he later held the professorship of logic
in Basel. His main interests in mathematics were infi-
nite series and the applications of probability theory
to questions of law. He formulated, in 1713, the noto-
rious Saint Petersburg paradox, which originated with
a gambling game. Suppose that Peter is tossing a fair
coin, and he will give Paul one ducat if the coin turns
up heads on the first toss, two ducats if it shows heads
for the first time on the second toss, and in general 2 n−1
ducats if the coin turns up heads for the first time on
the nth toss. The standard calculation shows that the
value of Paul’s expectation (E = 12 1 + 14 2 + 18 4 + · · · +    prime to n form what we now call a group under multi-
 1 n−1
2 n 2     + · · · ) is infinitely great. Nevertheless no “fairly   plication and he expanded the theory of quadratic and
reasonable man” would be willing to pay even a moder-
ately high price to purchase Paul’s prospects. The result
of the mathematical analysis clearly affronted common
sense; this was the paradox. Nicolaus’s cousin, Daniel,
discussed the problem while he was staying in Saint
Petersburg (hence the name given to the paradox). His
strategy was to distinguish two senses of expectation,
one mathematical and the other moral. The latter was
to take into account the individual characteristics of
the risk taker (his wealth, for instance).
   Although primarily a physicist and author of the
famous Hydrodynamica (1738), Daniel obtained a solu-
tion of the Riccati equation, y = r (x) + p(x)y +
q(x)y 2 , and engaged in the problem of the vibrating
string.
   Otto Spiess, from Basel, started to publish the com-
plete edition of the works and correspondence of the
Bernoullis in 1955. The project continues.

Euler was one of the most influential and prolific math-
ematicians in history. His first publication was a 1726
paper on mechanics, and his last was a collection pub-
lished in 1862, seventy-nine years after his death. There
are over eight hundred papers bearing his name, about
three hundred of them appearing posthumously, and
more than twenty books. His Opera Omnia fill over
eighty volumes.
In number theory, Euler introduced the Euler phi
function, φ(n), to denote the number of positive inte-
gers less than n and relatively prime to n, and proved
the fermat–euler theorem [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic) that n divides
aφ(n) − 1. He showed that the remainders relatively
higher-order residues. He proved fermat’s last the-
orem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) for n = 3. He stated that any real poly-
nomial of degree n is a product of real and quadratic
factors and has n complex roots, but was unable to give
complete proofs. He was the first to use generating
functions [IV.18 §§2.4, 3] when he gave a generating
function for Naudé’s partition problem: the question of
how many different ways a given integer can be written
as a sum of positive integers. He introduced the func-
tion σ (n), the sum of the divisors of an integer n, and
used this function to increase the number of known
pairs of amicable numbers (a pair m, n of numbers is
called amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of m
equals n, and vice versa) from 3 to over 100. He showed
that any prime number of the form 4 n + 1 is the sum of
two rational squares. lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) later improved
this result to show that such numbers are the sum of
two integer squares. Euler factored the fifth Fermat

number, F5 = 22 + 1, thus refuting fermat’s [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665)
conjecture that all integers of the form Fn = 22 + 1
were prime. He made extensive studies of the binary
quadratic forms x 2 +y 2 , x 2 +ny 2 , and mx 2 +ny 2 , and
proved a form of the law of quadratic reciprocity
[V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871).
  Euler was the first to use analytic methods in number
theory. In the 1730 s he calculated to several decimal
places the so-called Euler–Mascheroni constant

and discovered many of its properties. Mascheroni
added to those properties in the 1790 s. Euler also dis-
covered the sum–product formula for what we now call
the Riemann zeta function,

and he evaluated the function for positive even values
of s.
   In analysis, Euler was largely responsible for shaping     more use of these facts than any of his predecessors
the modern calculus curriculum. He was also the first
person to take a systematic approach to the solution
of differential equations and to problems of the cal-
culus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). He discovered a differ-
ential equation some times called the “Euler necessary
condition” and some times called the “Euler–Lagrange
equation.” The equation tells us that if J is defined by
the integral equation J = a f (x, y, y ) dx, then a func-     covered and gave a flawed proof that, for a polyhedron
tion y(x) that maximizes or minimizes J will satisfy

Euler apparently thought that the condition was also
sufficient. Very early in his career, he pioneered the
use of integrating factors for solving differential equa-
tions, though the almost simultaneous published solu-
tion of Clairaut was more complete and more widely
read, so credit for this innovation usually falls to
Clairaut. He also did the first work using what are
now called fourier series [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) and laplace trans-
forms [III.91](/part-03/transforms), more than a generation before laplace
[VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) or fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) began doing mathemat-
ics, though they took the fields much farther than
Euler had.
Much of Euler’s best work involved series. His first
widely acclaimed result was when he solved one of the
Leonhard Euler
best-known problems of his age, the seventy-year-old

“Basel problem.” The problem was to evaluate the sum
of the reciprocals of the square integers, or ζ(2). Euler

He developed the Euler–Maclaurin series to strength-
en the relationships between series and integrals. The
existence of the Euler–Mascheroni constant followed
from these researches. Using techniques he called

Euler was not the first to prove that eiθ = cos θ +
i sin θ or to know that eπ i = −1, but he made so much
that this last formula is generally known as Euler’s
identity.
He is regarded as a pioneer in topology and graph
theory for his necessary condition for a graph to have
an Euler path, the so-called Königsburg bridge prob-
lem. This is to determine whether or not a graph has a
path that traverses every edge exactly once. He also dis-
