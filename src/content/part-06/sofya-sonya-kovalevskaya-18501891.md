ρ : G → GLn (C), where GLn (C) is the group of n . imes n
invertible matrices over C), the associated character χ
is the map G → C such that χ(g) = trace ρ(g) for
g ∈ G. Frobenius proved the orthogonality relations,
recognized the connection of his characters with matrix
representations of the group, calculated the charac-
ter tables of the symmetric groups, the alternating
groups, and the Mathieu groups, and used properties of
induced characters to prove his famous theorem that a
transitive permutation group in which no element other
than the identity fixes two or more points has a regu-
lar normal subgroup (that is, a subgroup consisting of
the identity together with the fixed-point-free elements
of the group). To this day no purely group-theoretic
proof of this theorem has been found. In recognition
of his contribution such groups are now called Frobe-
nius groups. Through character theory and representa-
tion theory, as developed by Frobenius for finite groups
(and by his pupil, friend, and colleague Issai Schur for
classical matrix groups), group theory found impor-
tant applications in physics and chemistry a generation
later.

Partial differential equations; Abelian integrals
Kovalevskaya showed talent for mathematics at an
early age but as a woman in mid-nineteenth-century
Russia she was denied access to university. Unable to
leave the country unescorted she married and in 1869
traveled to Heidelberg, where she was taught mathe-
matics by Du Bois-Reymond. The following year she
moved to Berlin to work with weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897).
Berlin University was closed to women but Weierstrass
agreed to tutor her privately. Under his supervision
Kovalevskaya completed dissertations on partial dif-
ferential equations (PDEs), Abelian integrals, and Sat-
urn’s rings, and in 1874 she became the first woman
to receive a doctorate in mathematics. The dissertation

VI. Mathematicians
on PDEs, which excited particular attention, contained
the result now known as the cauchy–kovalevskaya
theorem [IV.12 §§2.2, 2.4], an important tool in estab-
li shing the existence of analytic solutions of PDEs.
That same year Kovalevskaya returned to Russia and,
unable to find a suitable position, temporarily aban-
doned mathematics. In 1880, at the invitation of cheby-
shev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894), she gave a paper on Abelian integrals at a
conference in Saint Petersburg. It was enthusiastic ally
received and in 1881 she returned to Berlin. She saw
Weierstrass frequently and devoted herself to the study
of the propagation of light in a crystalline medium—
a subject to which she had been led by studying the
work of the French physicist Gabriel Lamé—and to the
study of the rotation of a solid body about a fixed
point. Later that year she moved to Paris to work with
mathematicians there.
In 1883, championed by Mittag-Leffler, Kovalevskaya
was appointed as a Privatdozent at the University of
Stockholm. She also became an editor of Acta Mathe-
matica, making her the first woman to join the board
of a scientific journal. On behalf of Acta she liaised
with mathematicians from Paris, Berlin, and Russia,
providing an important link between Russian math-
ematicians and their western European counterparts.
She continued to work on the rotation problem and
Academy of Sciences. Prior to her work the problem
symmetrical. In the first, solved by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), the
Peter M. Neumann      center of gravity of the moving body coincides with the
fixed point; and in the second, solved by lagrange

on the same axis. Kovalevskaya discovered that there
was a third case, one that was asymmetrical and more
complicated than the other two, which could also
be solved completely. (It was later shown that there
are no others.) The novelty of her results lay in her
application of the recently developed theory of theta
functions—the simplest elements from which elliptic
functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) can be constructed—to solve Abelian
integrals.
Kovalevskaya became a full professor of mathemat-
ics at the University of Stockholm in 1889, the first
woman any where to achieve such a position. Shortly
afterward, she was nominated by Chebyshev for cor-
responding membership of the Russian Academy of
Sciences, her subsequent election breaking the gender
barrier once again.
