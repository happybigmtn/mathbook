theory, in particular his development of new methods
for probabilistic limit theorems.
   Dirichlet also influenced the further development of
mathematics by his mathematical style, by the exact-
ness and elegance of his proofs, and by his teaching.
Together with his friend jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851), he ushered
in a new epoch of mathematical teaching at German
universities by introducing lectures and seminars on
the most recent research, and with him began the
golden age of mathematics in Berlin. Although Dirich-
let did not found his own mathematical school, his
influence can be found in the work of Dedekind, Eisen-
stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), and riemann [VI.49], among
others.

Calculus of variations; optics; dynamics; algebra; geometry     with quaternions was concerned with their application
Hamilton was educated at Trinity College, Dublin.
Shortly before graduating in 1827, he was appointed
Professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ire-
land, a post which he held for the remainder of his life.
   His first paper, “Theory of systems of rays: part first”
(1828), was written while he was still an under grad-
uate. In it he developed new methods for the study
of foci and caustics produced by the reflection of
light from curved surfaces. Hamilton developed his
approach to optics over the following five years, pub-
li shing three substantial supplements to his original
paper. He showed that the properties of an optical sys-
tem are completely determined by a certain “character-
istic function” that is a function of the initial and final
coordinates of a ray of light and which measures the
time of passage of light through the system. In 1832 he
predicted that light falling at a certain angle on a biax-
ial crystal would be refracted to form a hollow cone
of emergent rays. This prediction was verified by his
friend and colleague Humphrey Lloyd.

Hamilton adapted his optical methods to the study of
dynamics. In a paper “On a general method in dynam-
ics” (1834), he showed that the dynamics of a system
of attracting and repelling point particles is completely
determined by a certain characteristic function, which
satisfies a differential equation, today referred to as
the hamilton–jacobi equation [IV.12 §2.1](/part-04/analysis). In a sub-
sequent paper, “Second essay on a general method in
dynamics” (1835), he introduced the principal func-
tion of a dynamical system, presented the equations
of motion of such a system in hamiltonian form
[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part-04/mirror-symmetry), and adapted methods of perturbation
theory to this setting.
Hamilton discovered the system of quaternions
[III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena) in 1843. The fundamental equations of this sys-
tem occurred to him in a flash of insight as he was walk-
ing along the bank of the Royal Canal, near Dublin, on
October 16 of that year. Most of his subsequent math-
ematical work involved quaternions. It is not difficult
to translate much of this work into the language of
modern vector analysis, and indeed many of the basic
emerged from Hamilton’s work on quaternions. Hamil-
ton applied quaternion methods to the study of dynam-
Ulf Hashagen   ics in a series of short papers published in the three
years immediately following his discovery of quater-

tems related to quaternions. However, most of his work
to the study of geometrical problems, and, in particular,
to the study of surfaces of the second order and (espe-
cially in the final years of his life) to the study of the
differential geometry of curves and surfaces. Much of
this research is to be found in his two books Lectures on
Quaternions (1853) and Elements of Quaternions (1866,
published posthumously).
