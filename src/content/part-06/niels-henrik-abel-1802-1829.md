geometry, given a line in a plane and a point not onthe line there are two lines through the point that are asymptotic to the given line (one in each direction); these two lines separate the lines through the point which meet the given line from those that do not. Loba-chevskii called these the parallels to the given line through the given point. Starting from this definition, he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles, and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the triangles are very small. He extended his results todescribe a geometry of three dimensions, thus making it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to measure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account of space than Euclidean geometry.He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-gradskii, a much better known mathematician in Saint Petersburg. He published in French in a German jour-nal in 1837, in German in a booklet of 1840, and again in French in 1855, but to little avail.appreciated the booklet of 1840 and in 1842 had Loba-gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) chevskii made a corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, but this was to be the only acclaim Lobachevskii received in his lifetime. financial and mental decline.

he died he left the family in straitened circumstances.Abel’s exceptional intellectual talents were recognized at school, and funds were raised to enable him to complete his education and, in particular, to study mathe-matics. At age twenty-two, he was awarded a scholarship to make a two-year tour of Europe, during whichhe studied in Berlin and Paris. In Berlin he met and was befriended by Auguste Crelle, the engineer who had just founded thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange-Crelle’s Journal li shed in the first four volumes of the journal. From). Almost all of Abel’s mathematical work was pub1826 until his death in 1829 Abel eked out a poor existence, earning a little by teaching, but using whatfew resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother. He died of consumption at the ageof twenty-seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin.Abel’s main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas. The first of these was the theory of equa-tions. Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) in 1770 and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) in 1815 about the form of functions of the roots of an equa-tion, and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted. Lagrange had hinted at the possi-bility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between 1799 and 1814 trying to provethis, though he had not managed to persuade his contemporaries. Abel’s first success was to give an accept-able proof of the fact that, for polynomial equations of degree 5, there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution. This first appeared in 1824 in a short pamphlet writtenin French and published privately in Christiania (Oslo). Once Abel reached Berlin, however, Crelle translated itinto German and published it in the first volume of his journal; he also published a fuller, more detailed account, covering polynomials of any degree greater than 4, in 1826.Abel returned to equations a few years later, publishing a long paper in 1829 about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions. His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as afunction of every other root, the second that these functions commute (in modern terms, the[V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) of the equation is commutative). He proved var-galois group ious theorems about such equations, the most striking

being that they are soluble by radicals. This represented an extensive generalization of the ideas described by gauss met ic ae[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) in the seventh part of, where the special case of cyclotomic equations Disquisitiones Arith(which satisfy both of these conditions) is treated sys-tematically. It was in honour of this work that, later, the adjective “Abelian” was applied to groups that are commutative. It is important to appreciate, however, that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations without any appeal to groups, which at that time werenot yet known. convergence. Although there had been over a centuryof critical thinking devoted to foundations of the cal-He also made major contributions to the theory of culus, modern ideas of rigour were only just emerg-ing in the writings of bolzano [VI.28](/part-06/bernard-bolzano-17811848), Cauchy, and others. Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy’s lectures of 1820–21, but series in general, and power series in particular, were still far from well understood. Among other contributions, Abel offereda proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers, and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel’s limit theorem.Perhaps his greatest discoveries, however, were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together. To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words: first, a new and productive approach to the theory ofa vast generalization of elliptic functions to what are elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem); and, second, now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals. Inthis area Abel competed for priority with jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). Most (though by no means all) of his work was written in two memoirs. One was published in two parts,“Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques” and “Précis d’une théorie des fonctions elliptiques,” coming to wellover two hundred pages in Crelle’s Journal in 1828 and

1829. The other, entitled “Mémoire sur une propriété générale d’une classe très étendue de fonctions tran-scendantes,” was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October 1826. There it lay on Cauchy’s desk, unread until after Abel’s death. It was published by the Paris Academy in 1841. The manuscript itself, however, was stolen by G. Libri, lost, and rediscovered in parts between 1952 and 2000 by Viggo Brun and Andrea del Centina. Prix de Mathématiques jointly to Abel (posthumously)In June 1830 the Paris Academy awarded its Grand and Jacobi for their work on elliptic functions.

Probably inspiredby his father’s attempts to prove the parallel postulate, a key assumption in Euclidean geometry, but very much against the advice of his father, János also attempted to prove it. But in 1820 he switched direction and attempted to show that there could be a geom-etry independent of the parallel postulate. By 1823 he believed he had succeeded, and after much subsequent discussion father and son agreed to publish the son’s ideas as a twenty-eight-page appendix to his father’stwo-volume work on geometry in 1832. of parallels, according to which, given a line in a plane In this appendix, Bolyai started from a new definition and a point not on the line, there are many lines through the point that do not meet the given line.

the triangles are very small. He also found a surface inhis three-dimensional geometry in which geometry is Euclidean. He concluded that there were logically two geometries and that it remained undecided which one corresponded to reality. He also showed that in his new geometry it was possible to construct a square equal inarea to a given circle, thus accomplishing a feat that was widely (and, as was later shown, correctly) believed to be impossible in Euclidean geometry.A copy of the book was sent to gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), who eventually replied on March 6, 1832, that he could not praise the work, for “to praise it, would be to praise myself,” going on to claim that the methods and results in the appendix agreed with his own work over the pre-vious thirty-five years, although he was “very glad that it was just the son of my old friend, who takes the precedence of me in such a remarkable manner.” this endorsement of the validity of János’s ideas pleased the father but infuriated the son, and soured rela-tions between father and son for several years.

Jacobi studied classics under the famous philologist Boeckh and philosophy under Hegel. Owing to the mediocrity of the mathematics

He read euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827), gausscians like Pappus and Diophantus. In 1825, Jacobi was[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and, last but not least, Greek mathemat i awarded his doctorate for a thesis, written in Latin, on the theory of functions. The subsequent disputatio (discussion) included critical comments both on Lagrange’s theory of functions and on his analytical mechanics. The following year Jacobi went to the University of Königsberg, where (in 1829) he got a full pro-fessorship. In 1834, he and the physicist F. E. Neumann founded the “Königsberg mathematical physics seminar,” which, because of the close connection between research and teaching that it fostered, soon led to Königsberg becoming the most successful and influ-ential educational institution for theoretical physics and mathematics in the German-speaking part of the scientific world. By 1844, when Jacobi left Königsbergbecause of poor health and in order to become a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, he was rec-ognized as Germany’s most important mathematician after Gauss. After seven more fruitful years of researchin Berlin he died unexpectedly from smallpox. mathematics, conceiving mathematical thinking as ameans of developing the human intellect and, indeed, Through out his life Jacobi was an advocate of pure of advancing humanity itself. He published his first paper in 1827: it was devoted to number theory (cubic residues) and was influenced by Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae higher residues, the division of the circle, quadratic. Further investigations were devoted to forms, and related subjects. Many of Jacobi’s resultsin number theory were published in the book Canon arithmeticus divisibility to algebraic numbers by Jacobi and Gauss(1839). The extension of the concept of paved the way for the later algebraic theory of numbers(by kummer [VI.40] and others). ofelliptic functions Jacobi’s “most original achievements” (in the words klein [VI.57]) were his contributions to the theory of[V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), which developed in competition withing with legendre abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) between 1827 and 1829.

tions, which emerged in the second half of the century.In particular, his application of research on elliptic functions to Diophantine equations became important for the development of analytic number theory. Jacobi’s contributions to algebra include investigations intothe theory of determinants (the “Jacobian” functional determinant) and their relation to inverse functions, into quadratic forms (“Sylvester’s law of inertia”), and into the transformation of multiple integrals.Even Jacobi’s work in mathematical physics bears the stamp of “pure mathematics”: following the analytical tradition of Euler and Lagrange, he presented the foundations of mechanics in an abstract and formal man-ner, paying special attention to the relation between conservation lawsspace and to the unifying role of variational princi-[IV.12 §4.1](/part-04/analysis) and symmetries of ples. Jacobi’s achievements in this area, which he devel-oped in close relation to the theory of differential equations and thewhat is now called the “Jacobi–Poisson theorem,” the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), include “principle of the last multiplier,” a theory for inte-grating hamilton’s [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) canonical equations of motion Jacobi theory”), and a time-independent formulation of[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) by transformation (“Hamilton the principle of least action (“Jacobi’s principle”). His approach to these areas and the results he obtained are documented in two comprehensive books basedon his lectures: Vorlesungen über Dynamik (1866) and Vorlesungen über Analytische Mechanik until 1996). The former had considerable impact on the(not published development of German mathematical physics in thelast third of the nineteenth century. The latter reveals Jacobi’s criticism of the traditional understanding of mechanical principles (as laws that are firmly based on empirical observation or a priori reasoning) and shows strong parallels with the “conventionalist” viewpoint, which did not become popular in science and philos-ophy until half a century later, when it numbered H.

The following year hemoved to Berlin, where he was appointed as a professor at the military academy and where he was also allowedto teach at the university. In 1831 he was made a professor at the university and from then on held positionsat both institutions until 1855, when he was appointed as the successor to Göttingen. gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) at the University of His guiding star was Gauss’s pioneering Dirichlet’s primary interest was in number theory.Disquisitiones arithmetic aeber theory into a mathematical discipline—which he(1801)—the work that made num studied through out his career. Dirichlet was not onlythe first mathematician to completely understand this work but he also became its interpreter, picking upits problems and improving its proofs, as well as developing its ideas. 1825, Dirichlet came to international prominence. Thepaper, which dealt with Diophantine equations of the With his very first publication, which appeared in formx5 + y5 = Az5, yielded substantial results for the verification ofcasen = 5 (these results were used byfermat’s last theorem legendre[V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) for the[VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833) for a complete proof for that case some weeks later). Ina paper published in 1837 Dirichlet came up with the new and revolutionary idea of applying analytical meth-ods to number theory. He introduced expressions that are now known asseries of the form Dirichlet L-series. These are infinite

many prime numbers. In two subsequent papers, pub-lished in 1838 and 1839, he used his new methods, among other things, to determine the formula of the class number of binary quadratic forms: that is, thenumber of proper classes of forms of given determinant. It is often said that these three papers mark thestart of analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Dirichlet also made important contributions to algebraic number theory, culminating in hisrem [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) for the Abelian group of units in an alge-unit theobraic number field. These contributions, together with numerous others due to him (e.g., his Sc hu bf a ch pr inz ip, or box principle; work on the law of biquadratic reciprocity; and results concerning Gaussian sums), were brought together in his influential Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie by his former student(lectures on number theory), \text{published dedekind} [VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in 1863. \text{Inspired by his close contact with fourier} [VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) \text{during his student days in Paris}, Dirichlet’s \text{other main interests were in analysis and mathematical physics}, \text{and in the connections between them}. \text{In a ground}-\text{breaking paper of} 1829, \text{Dirichlet not only gave the first strict proof of the convergence of a Fourier series under given conditions}, \text{but he also used new methods and concepts} (e.g., \text{his insight into the importance of conditional convergence of series}; \text{his Dirichlet function influencing the development of the concept of a function}) \text{that became classic and that served as a basis for countless nineteenth} - century \text{investigations} \text{on analy} - sis. \text{He also occupied himself with the determination of multiple integrals as well as with the expansion ofa function into spherical functions} (\text{Kugelfunktionen}) \text{and applied these results to problems in mathematical physics}. \text{His main contributions to mathematical physics include papers on the theory of heat}, hydrodynamics, \text{the gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid}, the$n$-\text{body problem}, \text{and potential theory}. \text{The first boundary}-\text{value problem} (the “\text{Dirichlet problem}” \text{of finding the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region}) \text{had already been handled by Fourier and others}, \text{but Dirichlet proved the uniqueness of the solution}, \text{while the dirichlet principle ing boundary problems for}[IV.12 §3.5](/part - 04/analysis) (\text{a method for solv}-\text{elliptic partial differential equations ational problems}[IV.12 §2.5](/part - 04/analysis) \text{by reducing them to}[III.94](/part - 03/variational - methods)) \text{was introduced by him in var i lectures on potential theory}, \text{enhancing a method introduced by Gauss}. \text{Connected with Dirichlet}’s \text{work onanalysis was his contribution to probability and error VI}.38. \text{Augustus De Morgan theory}, \text{in particular his development of new methods for probabilistic limit theorems}. \text{mathematics by his mathematical style}, \text{by the exact}-\text{Dirichlet also influenced the further development of ness and elegance of his proofs}, \text{and by his teaching}.\text{Together with his friend jacobi} [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851), \text{he ushered in a new epoch of mathematical teaching at german universities by introducing lectures and seminars on the most recent research}, \text{and with him began thegolden age of mathematics in Berlin}. \text{Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school}, \text{his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind}, Eisen - stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), \text{and riemann} [VI.49], \text{among others}. \text{Further Reading Butzer}, P.-L., M.

In July 1829, after his father’s sui-cide, Galois was again rejected by the École Polytechnique. He entered the École Préparatoire (later known asthe École Normale Supérieure) in October 1829 but was expelled in December 1830 for unacceptable behaviour arising from political disagreements with the authori-ties. Arrested on Bastille Day (14 July) 1831, he spent the next eight months in prison for flouting authority again. He emerged at the end of April 1832 but somehow got himself challenged to a duel. On 29 May he edited his manuscripts and wrote a summary of his dis-coveries in a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The duel took place the next morning and he died on 31 May1832. Much has been written about him. But a man who dies so young leaves little real evidence for historians to work with, however rich his story, and most of his biographers have allowed romantic invention to colour their accounts of his life. cal works (and a number of smaller and less important There are four main papers in Galois’s mathemat i items). The first to be published was “Sur la théorie des nombres,” which appeared in April 1830 and contains the theory of Galois fields. These are analogues of the complex numbers obtained by adjoining to the integers modulo a prime numberp a root of an irreducible poly- nomial congruence moduloof the basic features of what later became the theory ofp. The paper contains most finite fields.In the letter to Chevalier written on the eve of the duel, Galois mentions three memoirs. The first, now known as thetled “Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations Premier Mémoire, is a manuscript entipar radicaux.” Galois submitted work on the theory ofequations to the Paris Academy on 25 May and 1 June 1829, but this is now lost and it seems quite possible that Galois withdrew it on the advice of Cauchy (towhom it had been given to referee) in January 1830. In February 1830 he resubmitted his work in compe-tition for the Grand Prix de Mathématiques, but his manuscript was unfortunately and mysteriously loston the death of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (and the prize was awarded jointly tojacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851)).

His ideas led directly to “abstract algebra” (see [II.3 §6](/part-02/abstract-algebra-development)): when the abstract notion of field developed later in the nineteenth century, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fieldshad already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois theory developed directly out of the material in the Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed from the ideas in the Mémoire together with a series of papers published by Premier Mémoire and the Second Cauchy in 1845.

compete for positions at England’s Anglican universi-ties. This effectively forced him down a convoluted path toward his personal goal of a career as a research mathematician. He worked as an actuary in London in the1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by passing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some sixyears in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-ics, in England and in the United States. Most notably, Sylvester served as the first Professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold professorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health forced his retirement in 1894. The program sylvester set up at Johns Hopkins established his pivotal place in the history of American research-level mathematics, while his mathematical accomplishments had garnered him an international reputation as early as the 1860 s. with work on the problem of determining when two polynomial equations have a common root. This nat-Sylvester entered the research arena in the late 1830 s urally led not only to questions in the theory of determinants but also to an explicit, pioneering, and self-consciously algebraic analysis of the intermediate expressions that arise in Charles François Sturm’s algorithm for determining the number of real roots of a polynomial equation that lie between two given real numbers (1839, 1840). Sylvester followed this up with what he called the dialytic method of elimination: a new criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detecting whether two polynomial equations have a common root (1841).His next major research push came in the 1850 s when, together with theory of invariants. This involved an associated andcayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More concretely, given a binary form of a particular degree, Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for explicitly finding invariants and covariants of that formand for determining algebraic relations, or “syzygies,” between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two important papers: “On the principles of the calculus offorms” (1852) and “On a theory of the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions” (1853). In thelatter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law of inertia: if$Q(x^{1}$, . . . , xn) is a real quadratic form [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rankr , then there exists a (real) nonsingular

However, he then entered a fallow period that ended only with his move to Baltimore. While there, he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the problem of inductively determining, for binary forms first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4, etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generating set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordanhad proved that this number is always finite and, in so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley, who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, thebinary form of degree 5) was infinite. By 1879, Sylvester had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly independent covariants associated with a binary form of any given degree.Sylvester was the founding editor of the American Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80), and on matrix algebras (1884), appeared there.

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested inbuilding telescopes and scientific instruments than making shoes—the result being that his business failed and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen and take a job as a junior teacher to support his parents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and together they built functioning scientific instruments. Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age oftwenty he was publishing original research in calculus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to others such asto develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded thecayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on operators in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-ics to be presented by the society. The paper was important not only because it contained (arguably forthe first time) a clear definition of the concept of an operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as differentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as anobject in its own right. There was an explicit similarity between the laws he derived for functions of D and the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss below. man but family circumstances prevented this.

In sim-ple cases, his approach also reduces classical logic to symbolic mathematical form. Using the symbols 0 and1 to denote “nothing” and “universe” respectively, and denoting the complement of the class x by 1 - x, he derived (from the law of duality) the law$x(1 - x) = 0$, which represents the impossibility of an object simul-taneously possessing and not possessing a given property, otherwise known as the principle of contradic-tion. Boole also applied his calculus to the theory of probability. Boole’s algebra lay dormant until 1939, when Shannon discovered that it was the appropriate language for describing digital switching circuits. Boole’s work thus became an essential tool in the modern development of electronics and digital computer technology. ematics: differential equations, difference equations, Boole also made several other contributions to math operator theory, calculus of integrals, etc. His text-books on differential equations (1859) and finite differences (1860) include much of his original research and are still in print today, but he is best remembered as the father of symbolic logic and one of the foundersof computer science.

VI.44 Karl Weierstrass

b. Ostenfelde, Germany, 1815; d. Berlin, 1897 Analysis Weierstrass began his career studying finance and administration at the University of Bonn but his real interest was mathematics and he did not complete his course. He qualified as a teacher and taught in gym-nasia for fourteen years. The turning point in his life occurred when, at the age of almost forty, he publisheda ground-breaking paper on Abelian functions, in which he solved the problem of inversion of hyperelliptic inte-grals. Shortly afterward he was offered a position at the University of Berlin. He demanded of himself the very strictest standards, with the result that he published little. His ideas, and his reputation, spread through his excellent lectures, which drew students and established mathematicians from around the world.Weierstrass has been described as the “father of modern analysis.” He contributed to all branches of the subject: calculus, differential and integral equa-tions, the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), infinite series, elliptic and Abelian functions, and real and com-plex analysis. His work is characterized by attention to foundations and by scrupulous logical reasoning.“Weierstrass i an rigor” has come to denote rigor of the strictest standard. was heuristic, lacking logical foundations.

Butcauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) there were several major foundational problems withhis approach: verbal definitions of limit and continuity; frequent use of infinitesimals; and intuitive appealto geometry in proving the existence of various limits. Weierstrass and dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) (among others) determined to remedy this unsatisfactory situation, and set themselves the goal of establishing theorems in a “purely arithmetic” manner, as Dedekind put it.To that end, Weierstrass gave preciseε–δdefinitions ofwe still use today), thus banishing infinitesimals fromlimit [I.3 §5.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and continuity [I.3 §5.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) (those

He also defined the real numbers based on the robinson [VI.95](/part-06/abraham-robinson-19181974) some hundred years rationals (although Dedekind’s and cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) approaches proved more accessible). He was thereby largely responsible for the “arithmetization of analysis” (a term coined byable contributions to real analysis are his introduction klein [VI.57]). Among his remarkof uniform convergence (introduced independently by P. L. Seidel) and his example of an every where-contin-uous and nowhere-differentiable function (Cauchy and his contemporaries believed that a continuous function was differentiable except possibly at isolated points). Both riemann [VI.49] and Weierstrass (succeeding Cauchy) founded complex function theory, but theyhad fundamentally different approaches to the subject. Riemann’s global, geometric conception was based onthe notion of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and on the dirichlet principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis), while Weierstrass’s local algebraic theory was grounded in power seriesand analytic continuation [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). “\text{The more} I \text{ponder the principles of function theory}—and I \text{do so incessantly}—\text{the more} I \text{am convinced that it must be founded on simple algebraic truths}. . .,” \text{he asserted in a letter to} H.

This was mostly pure mathe-matics. He generalized permutation groups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) using the calculus of operations as a basis, and hesaw that not only were matrices useful as a notational device, but they also constituted a study in their ownright. Not generally an excitable person, at the point of discovery he declared theas “very remarkable” and generations of mathemati-Cayley–Hamilton theorem cians have shared his delight. Matrix algebra was usedin his solution of the Cayley–Hermite problem, which required a description of those linear transformations that leave a bilinear form invariant. A special case of the solution gives rise to the(I - T )(I + T )-1. The links between quaternions, matri-Cayley orthogonal transform ces, and group theory that he observed in the 1850 sare indicative of his concern for the organization of mathematics.

He discovered Cayley’s formula for the general form of covariants of binary forms and counting them.

In astronomy he contributed to the theory of ellipan assiduous attention to detail. His work on the lunar theory was noteworthy, and in one long calculation he helped to settle an Anglo-French controversy by veri-fying the correct value for the secular acceleration of the Moon, which had been established by John Couch Adams in 1853. Cayley returned to the academic world in 1863 as the founding Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathemat-ics at Cambridge. In 1868 Paul Gordan startled invariant theorists by proving that invariants and covariants of a binary quantic could be expressed in terms of a finiteley’s but, undaunted, he completed his series with a list-basis. This contradicted an earlier result of Caying of the irreducible invariants and covariants of thebinary form of order 5 (the binary quintic), and their connecting syzygies. Many developments in pure mathematics can be traced back to his minor notes of the 1870 s and 1880 s, including the theory of knots, fractals, dynamic programming, and group theory (the well-knownley’s theorem). In graph theory, the number of dis-Caytinct labeled trees withn \text{nodes being} (nn)-2 \text{is known} as Cayley’s graph theorem. He brought his theoretical knowledge of graphical trees to bear on the prob-lem of counting isomers in organic chemistry, thus prompting questions about the actual existence of cer-tain chemical compounds that have since been discovered in many instances by chemists. In the last decade of his life, Cayley set about the task that gavehim an important line of contact with today’s mathematicians: the publication of hisical Papers in thirteen large volumes by Cambridge Collected Mathemat University Press.

VI.47 Charles Hermite

b. Dieuze, Moselle, France, 1822; d. Paris, 1901 Analysis (elliptic functions, differential equations); algebra (invariant theory, quadratic forms); approximation theory Like many who aspired to enter the École Polytech-nique, Hermite undertook special preparatory classes, in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand.He began to study serious mathematics, immersing himself in the work ofdre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution oflagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen equations by radicals. Admitted to the École Polytechnique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed his first significant original work. This extended results of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very positively. This achievement both brought him recognition in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobion elliptic functions and number theory that launched Hermite’s career. commensurate with his abilities, and for almost adecade survived on teaching assistant and examiner Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms, where he followed ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study transformation. It was in this context that thetian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) named after him arose. Her-hermimite was interested in invariants of quadratic forms, and also applied his work to the problem of locationof roots of polynomials. As a result of these efforts, in 1856 he was appointed to the Paris Academy of Sciences, with port ing him. This appointment was quickly followed liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) supby Hermite’s 1858 discovery of a means to express the solutions of the general fifth-degree polynomial equa-tion in terms of elliptic functions, which earned him widespread international recognition. ence in Paris in 1869, Hermite became an influential Finally obtaining a professorship at the Faculty of Scimentor for a generation of mathematicians, his best-known protégés including J.

E. Picard, P. Appell, and E. Goursat. Hermite’s dynas-tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law, Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-ried borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956). His advocacy of improved international communication led to German work becoming much better known in France than it had been previously. During this period, he obtained a proof ofthe transcendence [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) of “e” using continued fraction approximation theory (which had included the inven-[III.22] methods based on earlier research in tion of the Hermite polynomials). His influence in the mathematical community was strong until his death.

These activities left him wealthy and free to return to Berlin and concentrate on mathematics without holding an academic position. In 1855, Kronecker’s former school teacher and closest scientific friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861, Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin University. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897)) highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about Kronecker. After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kronecker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his teaching activities as well as the frequency of his publications. This last active period was cut short when hedied, shortly after the death of his wife.

In 1868, he was Kronecker was renowned for the originality of his offered the chair at Göttingen formerly held by[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and was elected to the Paris Academy. After thegauss Franco-Prussian war of 1870–71, he was invited to rec-ommend mathematicians for the newly opened German university in Strasbourg; and in 1880 he became the managing editor of thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange-Crelle’s Journal li shed, or in com pre he ns i ble proofs—). He was often criticized for incomplete, unpub-jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) spoke of his colleagues’ “envy and despair” with regard to his results. Only in his later years was he explicit about his constructivist methodology. This constituted at least part of the quarrel with Weierstrass, and later prompted hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) to call Kronecker a “Verbotsdiktator” (“forbidding dictator”). Generally affable and hospitable, Kronecker was tough in defending his mathematical ideas and his claims to priority. (in the early 1850 s), he claimed not only the so-called In his first works on solvable algebraic equations Kronecker–Weber theorem (in today’s formulation: every finite Galois extension of the rational num-bers with Abelian galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) lies in a field generated by roots of unity; the first correct proof of itwas given by Hilbert in 1896), but also a generalization to Abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields, which he later called his “liebster Jugendtraum” (“dear-est dream of his youth”). This dream, which was incorrectly translated by Hilbert into his twelfth problem in1900, is today part of class field theory [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871) and the theory of complex multiplication. Such connections between algebra, analysis, and arithmetic continuedto pervade Kronecker’s later work. Important results of Kronecker include class number relations and limit formulas in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, and a theory of bilinear forms. braic number theory, but only in 1881 did he pub-lish his “Grundzüge einer arithmetischen Theorie der In the late 1850 s, Kronecker began to work on al ge algebraischen Grössen,” dedicated to Kummer on the fiftieth anniversary of his doctorate. This mathematical testament contains an (incomplete) exposition of a unified arithmetical theory of algebraic numbers and alge-braic functions. As a research program, it adumbrates important aspects of class field theory as well as ofan arithmetico-geometric theory in dimensions higher than one. Kronecker’s concept of “divisor” is equivalent

For this, he propagated the introduction of indeterminates and equiv-alence relations, a method which he traced back to Gauss. In the case of a finite extension of the rational numbers, for instance, Kronecker is explicitly working with polynomials modulo an irreducible equationf (x) = 0, rather than adjoining a root of it.

Selasca, Italy, 1866 Real and complex analysis; differential equations; differential geometry; heat distribution; number theory; propagation of shock waves; topology Riemann was born into a poor pastor’s family and stud-ied mathematics at Göttingen, eventually becoming a professor there. His health broke in 1862 and he diednear Lake Maggiore, Italy, of pleurisy at the age of thirty-nine.No mathematician is more associated with the midnineteenth-century transition from algorithmic to con-ceptual thought than Riemann. His doctoral thesis of 1851, and still more his paper on Abelian functions(1857), promoted the view that a holomorphic function riemann equations[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) is properly defined by the[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and is to be studied cauchy through a close connection with the theory of harmonic functionsa proof of the remarkable[IV.24 §5.1](/part-04/stochastic-processes).

This states that ifconnected open subsets in the complex plane, neither X and Y are any two simply of which is the whole plane, then there is a holomorphic map from one to the other with a holomorphic inverse.

(The in algebraic geometry as well as complex analysis, determines the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions on a given Riemann surface with a pre-scribed number of poles.) In 1857 he extended the theory of differential equations, specifically the impor-tant case of the hypergeometric equation, to complex functions. In 1859 he used deep, new ideas from complex function theory to study the (Riemann) zeta func-tion and proposed his celebrated conjecture, the riemann hypothesis of the complex zeros of this function. The conjecture[IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), concerning the location remains unsolved to this day. These ideas enabled mathematicians to study complex functions on domains other than the plane and subsets of the plane. They opened the way to a geometric study of algebraic functions and algebraic curves, and proved to be decisive in the study of the integrals of algebraic functions (the theories of Abelian functions and theta functions of several variables). Investigations of the Riemann zeta function led not only to the discovery of new properties of classes of complex func-

This left open the questions of what sorts of functions did not satisfy these conditions and how could they be studied. Riemann reformulated the concept of the integral and wasable to show that it is not just the continuity of a function and the ways in which it may fail to be continuous that affect the accuracy of its Fourier series representation, but the nature of its oscillations. The riemann integral remained the dominant definition of the integral until it was replaced by the lebesgue integral [III.55](/part-03/measures) after 1902, which is better adapted to capturing the way the behavior of a function affects its Fourier series.In a lecture, also given in 1854 (but published posthumously in 1868), he entirely reformulated geometry asbeing about spaces (sets of points, which he called manifolds(an appropriate concept of distance) and argued that[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) with a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) the geometric properties of a space were its intrinsic ones. He noted that there are three constant-curvature spaces in two dimensions and showed how the idea ofconstant curvature can be extended to higher dimensions. In passing, he was the first person to write down ametric for non-Euclidean geometry (more than a decade before Beltrami’s publication of 1868, which legitimized non-Euclidean geometry).

b. Brunswick, Germany, 1831; d. Brunswick, Germany, 1916 Algebraic number theory; algebraic curves; set theory; foundations of mathematics Dedekind spent most of his life as a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Brunswick, Germany (his andgauss’s [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) home town), having spent the years 1858–62 at the Polytechnikum in Zürich (which later became known as ETH).

Dedekind was a retiring man dirichlet [VI.36] with, ashe remained a bachelor, living with his mother andklein [VI.57] said, a “contemplative nature;” sister.

Indeed, he shaped mod-[I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). His main contribution, however, was ern number theory as we know it, presenting it as atheory of ideals in rings of integers (see algebraic numbers [[IV.1 §§4–7]](/part-04/algebraic-numbers)). This was first made public in 1871, within Supplement X to his edition of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, where he established unique decomposition of ideals into prime ideals for all rings of algebraic integers. In the process, he for-mulated the concepts of field, ring, ideal, and module (see [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)), always within the par-ticular context of the complex numbers. It was also in the context of algebra (Galois theory) and num-ber theory that Dedekind started systematic work with

This work paved the way for riemann modern algebraic geometry. and number theory were his reflections on the foun-Intimately linked with Dedekind’s work in algebra dations of the real number system. In 1858 (published1872) he formulated a definition of the real numbers using what are now known as “Dedekind cuts” in the set of rational numbers. During the 1870 s (published1888) he elaborated a purely set-theoretic definition of the natural numbers as “simply infinite” sets, whichled him to crystallize the dedekind–peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms). In this work, as in his more advanced research, sets, structures, and mappings form the essential building blocks, the very foundations of pure mathematics.In the light of (now superseded) conceptions of logic, this led Dedekind to the view that “arithmetic (algebra, analysis) is only a part of logic.” From a modern viewpoint, his contributions show that set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) is a sufficient foundation for classical mathematics.Thus he contributed as much as anybody else to the set-theoretic reformulation of modern mathematics.

Cantor was able to establish much more generalf in gen- results, and in five papers written between 1870 and 1872 he was able to show that such representations were unique even if an infinite number of exceptional points were allowed, so long as these exceptional points (i.e., points at which the function failed to be continu-ous) were distributed over the domain of the function’s definition in a particular way, constituting what Cantor called “point sets of the first species.” His studies ofthese and related point sets eventually led Cantor to his much more abstract and powerful theory of sets and transfinite numbers.

It was Cantor’s subsequent study(n + 1)\text{st derived set was} of infinite linear point sets that would eventually lead tohis creation of transfinite set theory in the 1880 s. (For more details about this, see Before he did so, Cantor first began to explore theset theory [IV.22 §2](/part-04/set-theory).) implications of his work on trigonometric series andthe structure of the real numbers in several papers, one of which was to revolutionize mathematics in a fundamental way. The first of these papers was pub-lished in 1874, and bore the innocuous title “Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen” (“On a property of the collection of all real algebraic numbers”). In this paper, Cantor proved that the set of all algebraic real numbers wasnite [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets). What was revolutionary about the paper, countably infihowever, was that he also proved that the set of all real numbers was not countable, and must be of a higher order of infinity than the countably infinite set of natural numbers. He returned to this result in 1891 witha new approach, the groundbreaking method of diagonalization, to prove in a very direct way that the set ofreal numbers is uncountably infinite. Cantor’s second important paper of the decade appeared in 1878, “Ein Beitrag zur mannigfaltigkei tslehre” (“A contribution tothe theory of aggregates”), \text{in which he proved} (\text{with a partly faulty argument}) \text{the invariance of dimension}, \text{a theorem first correctly proved by brouwer} [VI.75](/part - 06/luitzen - egbertus - jan - brouwer - 18811966) in 1911. \text{designed to outline the basic elements of his new think}-\text{ing about sets}. \text{He first considered what happened if a Between} 1879 and 1884 \text{Cantor published six papers set were not of the first species by introducing sym}-\text{bols for the infinite indices needed to identify such sets}. \text{For example}, \text{a setond species if there was no finite} P \text{was said to be of then such that the nsec}-\text{th derived set Pn of Pwas finite}. \text{He then considered the case in which the intersection of all the derived sets of} P (namely P^, P^ , . . . , Pn, . . .) was again an infinite set, which he designated had a derived set as well, P \infty. This set, since it was infinite,$P^$\infty$+1$, and this led in fact to an entire sequence of derived sets of the second species:$P \i\text{nf ty}$, P$\i\text{nf ty}$+1, $. . . , P^$\infty$+n$, . . . , P2 \i\text{nf ty}, . . . . In his first papers on infinite linear sets, these indices for derived sets remained “infinitary symbols”: that is, devices for distinguishing between different sets. But

779

in hislehre (“Foundations of a general set theory”), published Grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannigfaltigkei tsin 1883, these symbols became the first transfinite numbers: the transfinite ordinal numbers. These numbers began with re sent ing the sequence of natural numbers 1ω, the transfinite ordinal number rep-, 2, 3, . . . , which could also be thought of as the first infinite ordinal number after all of the finite whole numbers. In the Grundlagen, Cantor not only devised the basic features of a transfinite arithmetic for these numbers, but he provided a detailed philosophical defense of the new numbers. Acknowledging the revolutionary nature of what he was introducing, he argued that the new concepts were necessary in order to achieve precise mathematical results that he could obtain by noother means. ever, the transfinite cardinal numbers, which he de-noted using the Hebrew letter aleph, were introduced Cantor’s best-known mathematical creation, howonly later, in the 1890 s. They were first given full expo-sition in a pair of papers (1895, 1897) that constituted his “Beiträge zur Begrundung der transfiniten Mengen-lehre” (“Contributions to the founding of transfinite set theory”). In two articles published in Mathematische annalen ordinal and cardinal numbers, as well as their arith-, he not only set out his theory of transfinite metics, but also explained his theory of order types, namely the different properties exhibited by the sets of natural, rational, and real numbers considered in their natural orders. There he also stated (but could notprove) his famous continuum hypothesis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), namely that the power (or cardinal number) of the con-tinuum of all real numbers R is the next largest infinite set (or cardinal number) after the countably infi-nite set of natural numbers N, the cardinality of which was taken to be hypothesis algebraically as the statement that 2א0. \text{Cantor expressed the continuum}א0 = א . orary degrees from foreign universities and the Cop-ley Medal of the Royal Society for his great contribu-By the end of his career Cantor had received hon-1 tions to mathematics, but there were problems withset theory that were beyond his capacities to remedy. The most disturbing for many mathematicians were the“antinomies” of set theory: the paradoxes put forward by the likes of Burali-Forti andthe former published the paradox arising from the col-russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970).

that are not members of themselves: is it a member ofitself or not? (See the crisis in the foundations of mathematics [II.7 §2.1](/part-02/foundations-crisis).) Cantor himself was aware of the contradictions that arose from considering the col-lections of all transfinite ordinal or cardinal numbers, and what their ordinal or cardinal numbers might be.The solution Cantor adopted was to regard such collections as too large, and not really sets at all, but “in consistent aggregates” as he called them. Others, like Zer-melo, began to axiomatize set theory in an effort to exclude the possibility of contradictions. The two most powerful results of the twentieth century to complement Cantor’s work are those of gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) (who established the consistency of the continuum hypoth-esis with zermelo–fraenkel set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory)) and Paul Cohen (who determined the independence ofthe continuum hypothesis from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), the latter finally establishing the impossibility of proving the continuum hypothesis. truly been revolutionary. Above all, his transfinite settheory for the first time gave mathematicians the Cantor’s legacy for the history of mathematics has means of dealing with concepts of the infinite in acareful and precise way.

also came second in the more demanding Smith’s prize examination. In 1868 he became a Fellow of Trinity, leaving in 1871 to become the professor of applied mathematics at University College London. He died of tuberculosis in 1879. A versatile mathematician, regarded by many as the best of his generation, Clifford’s favorite field was geometry, over which he ranged widely, proving new results in classical Euclidean geometry as well as in projective and differential geometry. He was the first English mathematician to appreciate the work of riemann [VI.49] on differential geometry, and published a translation of Riemann’s paper “On the hypothe-ses that lie at the foundations of geometry” in 1873. He endorsed Riemann’s fundamental reformulation of geometry, and went even further in speculating that the curvature of physical space might explain the motion of matter. He also made a significant application of thethe first to analyze the complicated topological nature riemann–roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), and was among of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) by showing how to dissect any Riemann surface into simple pieces in a stan-dard way. He was the first to study a geometry locally equivalent to plane geometry but topologically distinct(the flat torus, also known today as the Clifford–Klein space form after klein’s [VI.57] later more detailed study of it). In algebra, he invented the biquaternions(these are like quaternions, but have complex numbers as coefficients). Clifford was regarded as a marvelous lecturer until his health broke, and he was a successful popularizer and essay writer. He forcefully adopted the view that geometry was a matter of experience, not a priori truth. He was a friend of T. H. Huxley and was sympathetic tohumanism in philosophy.

His Ph.D. thesis Frege was trained at Jena and Göttingen, receiving addressed the spatial representation of imaginary ele-ments in geometry, and his 1874 Habilitation essay at Jena worked out some basic details of what we wouldnow call “iteration theory.” Though his early work gave no obvious sign of the revolutionary work to come, with hindsight one can discern a foundational motif running through even the apparently conventional math-ematics of the early work: a conviction that arithmetic was in some way or other logical, and that geometry was fundamentally different and less general because it was grounded in spatial intuition. This is an especially salient concern in some of his areas of early research, such as Plücker’s line geometry and riemann’s [VI.49] complex analysis, where the role of visual represen-tation was a matter of some dispute. Frege sought to resolve the dispute by deriving arithmetic and analy-sis rigorously from logical principles. His motivation was not so much a desire for certainty: rather, heheld that only “gap-free” proofs can reveal a science’s fundamental principles.Among the features of contemporary logic appearing first in Frege’s core logical writings ((1879) and Grundgesetze der Arithmetik Begriffsschrift(volume 1, 1893; volume 2, 1903)) are the following. (i) Inferences are analyzed within a quantified logic of propositions, which extends to relations as wellas to propositions of subject–predicate form. We would today describe Frege’s logical system as ahigher-order predicate calculus. (ii) Forms from syllogistic logic (such as “All As are Bs”) are interpreted as quantified conditionals (“For allx, if x is an A, then xis a B”), in the way that is now so standard as to seem inescapable, presenting implicitly the point that the underlying logical form of a proposition may differ fromits surface grammar. (iii) The syntax of the language is explicitly displayed, and inferences are carried out strictly in accordance with the form of statements by explicitly stated rules. (iv) Rules of inference and axioms are distinguished; the consequence relation and conditionals are distinguished. (v) “Function” is taken as an undefined primitive con-cept. (This was a contentious move. Some math-

It would be several decades before Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and logicians approached Frege’s standards for exactness and clarity. The notation, however, seemed unwieldy to readers at the time (and since). Here, for example, is the statement “if notq, then every v is F”$(¬q =⇒(∀v)F(v))$ in Frege’s notation: v F(v) q (Here represents negation, v is the universal quantifier, and the long vertical line represents the conditional.) arithmetik on English-language philosophy since its translation Frege also wrote an informal treatise,(1884), which has had a profound influence Grundlagen der in 1950. Its account of number contains the first hint ofthe tension that would collapse the project from within. Frege sets out conditions that a definition of number must satisfy to be counted as “acceptable.” However, when formalized these lead to a contradiction, of a similar type to Russell’s paradox (on the set of all sets thatare not members of themselves). This problem escaped Frege’s notice until Russell alerted him to it in a let-ter of 1903. Frege’s reaction (“arithmetic totters”) has been taken to be an over reaction to the failure of one set of axioms among many possible ones. But in Frege’sview, the problem was not with the specific axioms, but rather that any logically adequate weakening appearedto violate some principle he took to be grounded in the nature of thought. Recently, many logicians who do not share Frege’s often baroque-seeming metaphysics of concepts have shown that some natural consistent weakenings of Frege’s system do support the derivation of the mathematics Frege aimed to reconstruct.

After Plücker’s death in 1868 he went to Göttingen to study with Alfred Cleb-sch, where he worked exclusively on mathematics. In 1869–70 he spent some months in Berlin studying with weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) and kummer [VI.40] before joining After passing his habilitation in Göttingen in 1871, lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) for a trip to Paris to see hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901). he took positions successively at Erlangen, Munich, and Leipzig, returning to Göttingen in 1886, where he remained until he retired (because of poor health) in1913. In 1875 he married Anna Hegel, a granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.In 1872 Klein published his celebrated “Erlanger Programm,” a creative and unified conception of geom-etry. Building on a paper of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) of 1859 in which Cayley had shown how to deduceean geometry [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from projective geometry euclid[I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), Klein applied his knowledge of group theory(learned from jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) in Paris) to create a hierarchy of all geometries. He had recognized that each geometry could be characterized by a group of transformations and classified accordingly (seedamental mathematical definitions [I.3 §6.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)). Thesome fun-

classification showed, as Klein had anticipated, that ofall the geometries, projective is the most basic and that the others, e.g., affine, hyperbolic, Euclidean, etc., are subsumed at some level beneath it. Moreover, it was clear from his construction that a contradiction ineuclidean geometry [[II.2 §§6–10]](/part-02/geometry) would simultane-nonously involve a contradiction in Euclidean geometry.Klein regarded his work in function theory as his greatest achievement. As his career progressed, hemoved more and more from Plücker’s and Clebsch’s strictly geometric viewpoint toward the wider out-look embraced by riemann [VI.49], who had regarded analytic functions as given by conformal mappings between given domains. In his “Riemanns Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihrer Integrale” (1882), Klein gave a geometric treatment of function theory in which he fused Riemann’s ideas with the rigorous power-series methods of Weierstrass. Klein’s health broke down. His attempt to keep upwith In 1882, when he was at the height of his powers, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in the race to develop the theory of automorphic functions (which are generalizations of periodic functions such as trigonometric functions, elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), etc.), during which he had proved his famous Grenzkreis (boundary circle) The-orem, had left him exhausted, and he was never again able to work with such intensity and at such a high level.After his breakdown Klein’s interest shifted progressively from research toward pedagogy. In his efforts tomodernize mathematical education he developed outstanding organizational skills and initiated important and far-reaching editorial projects ranging from the preparation of lecture notes to coediting the twentyfour-volumes ch af ten (1896–1935).

(1910) and gravitation (1918). Klein was an interna-tional figure who traveled widely, including to the United States and the United Kingdom, and he playeda significant role in the first International Congresses of Mathematicians. His many foreign students included several from the United States, e.g., Maxime Bôcher and William Fogg Osgood, and a number of women, notably Grace Chisholm Young and Mary Winston. Klein’s achievements made Göttingen the scientific center of Germany and one of the mathematical cen-ters of the world. He possessed an outstanding ability to “see” the truth in mathematical statements and to bring mathematical fields together without feeling the necessity for detailed calculations and justification (which he left to his students and others). He believed strongly in the unity of mathematics.

Berlin, 1917 Analysis; linear algebra; number theory; theory of groups; character theory After school in Berlin, Frobenius (who suppressed hisfirst name and wrote mainly as G. Frobenius) spent one semester studying mathematics and physics in Göttingen, then returned to Berlin where he studied under kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), kummer [VI.40], weierstrass sertation (in Latin) supervised by Weierstrass, in 1870,[VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), and others. He wrote his doctoral dison infinite series representations of analytic func-tions of one variable. For four years he worked as a schoolteacher in Berlin before he became Außerordentlicher Professor (associate professor) at Berlin Uni-versity. After less than two years, in 1875, he was called to a full professorship at the Eidgenössische Technis-che Hochschule in Zürich, where he remained until

Later he wrote mainlyon theta functions, algebra, and number theory. One of His early contributions were to analysis and the his well-known contributions lies across group theoryand number theory. Given a polynomial with coefficients in an algebraic number field, one may ask forthe degrees of the irreducible factors that occur when it is reduced modulo a prime ideal. In particular, onemay ask for the “density” (suitably defined) of the set of prime ideals modulo which a given pattern of irreducible-factor degrees arises. Pursuing ideas of Kro-necker, Frobenius proved that, if the galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) is thesity is the proportion of elements of the group whose symmetric group [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups), then that dencycle structure is the pattern of degrees. He conjectured that this should be true whatever the Galois group. A tool he used for this led to the name “Frobenius automorphism” for the natural generator$a \to a^{q}$ of the Galois group of a finite extension of the field F . The conjecture was proved by N. G. Chebotaryov in 1925 and is now known as the Chebotaryov density theorem, or, sometimes, the Frobenius–Chebotaryov$q$ density theorem.Another well-known and important contribution was to the theory of matrices and linear transformations, where Frobenius introduced the minimal polynomial and other invariants (the elementary divisors). theory. Like Otto Hölder andhe focused for a time on the search for Frobenius is best known for his work in finite group william burnside finite simple[VI.60](/part-06/william-burnside-18521927), groups invention of the theory of[V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups). His greatest contribution, however, is hisgroup characters [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory). This emerged unexpectedly in 1896 out of his studyof group determinants. These are the determinants of square matrices with rows and columns indexed by the members of a finite group x - 1, \text{where the xg are independent variables}, \text{one for} G, \text{and with} (a, b)-\text{entry each element respondence withab} g \text{of dedekind} G. \text{His interest}, \text{stimulated by cor}-[VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916), was in how the group determinant factorizes as a polynomial in these variables. This problem led Frobenius to the discoveryof certain sets of complex numbers, which he called gruppencharacte re the group, that arose as the solutions of sets of linear, one for each conjugacy class in equations connected with the group. Nowadays they are defined differently: for each complex linear repre-sentationρ of the group G (that is, homomorphism$784$ρinvertible matrices over: G \to GLn(C), where GLC), the associated charactern(C) is the group of n \times  nχ is the mapg \in  G. Frobenius proved the orthogonality relations, G \to  C such that χ(g) = trace ρ(g) for recognized the connection of his characters with matrix representations of the group, calculated the character tables of the symmetric groups, the alternating groups, and the Mathieu groups, and used properties of induced characters to prove his famous theorem that atransitive permutation group in which no element other than the identity fixes two or more points has a regu-lar normal subgroup (that is, a subgroup consisting of the identity together with the fixed-point-free elementsof the group). To this day no purely group-theoretic proof of this theorem has been found. In recognition of his contribution such groups are now called Frobenius groups. Through character theory and representa-tion theory, as developed by Frobenius for finite groups (and by his pupil, friend, and colleague Issai Schur for classical matrix groups), group theory found important applications in physics and chemistry a generation later.

on PDEs, which excited particular attention, contained the result now known as the cauchy–kovalevskaya theorem [[IV.12 §§2.2, 2.4]](/part-04/partial-di-erential-equations), an important tool in establishing the existence of analytic solutions of PDEs.That same year Kovalevskaya returned to Russia and, unable to find a suitable position, temporarily aban-doned mathematics. In 1880, at the invitation of chebyshev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894), she gave a paper on Abelian integrals at a conference in Saint Petersburg. It was enthusiasticall yreceived and in 1881 she returned to Berlin. She saw Weierstrass frequently and devoted herself to the studyof the propagation of light in a crystalline medium— a subject to which she had been led by studying the work of the French physicist Gabriel Lamé—and to thestudy of the rotation of a solid body about a fixed point. Later that year she moved to Paris to work with mathematicians there. In 1883, championed by Mittag-Leffler, Kovalevskaya was appointed as a Privatdozent at the University of Stockholm. She also became an editor of Acta mathematica of a scientific journal. On behalf of, making her the first woman to join the board Acta she liaised with mathematicians from Paris, Berlin, and Russia, providing an important link between Russian math-ematicians and their western European counterparts. She continued to work on the rotation problem andin 1885 made the breakthrough that, three years later, would win her the prestigious Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Sciences. Prior to her work the problem had been completely solved for only two cases, both symmetrical. In the first, solved bycenter of gravity of the moving body coincides with theeuler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), the fixed point; and in the second, solved by lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), the center of gravity and the fixed point lieon the same axis. Kovalevskaya discovered that there was a third case, one that was a symmetrical and more complicated than the other two, which could also be solved completely. (It was later shown that there are no others.)

From there he won a place at Cam-bridge, where he read for the Mathematical Tripos and graduated as 2 nd Wrangler in 1875. For ten years he remained in Cambridge as a Fellow of Pembroke Col-lege, coaching student rowers and mathematicians. In 1885, having published three very short papers, he was appointed professor at the Royal Naval College, Green-wich. He married in 1886 and the next year, at the age of thirty-five, he embarked on his career as a productive mathematician. He was elected as a Fellow ofthe Royal Society in 1893 on the basis of his contributions in applied mathematics (statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics), geometry, and the theory of functions. Although he continued to contribute to theseareas through out his working life, and added probability theory to his fields of interest during World War I, he turned to the theory of groups in 1893, and it is forhis discoveries in this subject that he is remembered. groups. He was much concerned with the search for Burnside treated every aspect of the theory of finite finite simple groups, and made the famous conjecture, finally proved by Walter Feit and John Thompson in 1962, that there are no simple groups of odd composite order (seegroups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups)). \text{He helped to develop character theory}, the \text{classification} \text{of finite simple which had been created by frobenius} [VI.58](/part - 06/ferdinand - georg - frobenius - 18491917) in 1896, \text{into a tool for proving theorems of pure group theory}, \text{using it in} 1904 \text{to spectacular effect when he proved his so} - called pαqβ-theorem: \text{the theorem that groups whose orders are divisible by at most two different prime numbers are soluble}. \text{By asking}, \text{in effect}, \text{whether a group all of whose elements have finite order and which is generated by finitely many elements must befinite}, \text{he launched the huge area of research which for much of the twentieth century was known as the Burnside problem} (\text{seegroup theory} [IV.10 §5.1](/part - 04/geometric - and - combinatorial - group - theory)).\text{geometric and combinatorial} 785 \text{man had written about groups before him}, \text{he was the Although cayley} [VI.46](/part - 06/arthur - cayley - 18211895) \text{and the Reverend} T.

(iv) analysis (1902–12)$; (v) \text{mathematical physics} (1910–22)$; and (vi) foundations (1918–30). Remarkably, there is very little overlap. When Hilbert finished a subject, he was finished with it. solved Gordan’s problem, named after Paul Gordan, ina single bold move. Given a polynomial equation with at Hilbert’s first breakthrough came in 1888 when he least two variables, some things about the polynomial change and some do not when you change coordinate systems. For example, consider the real polynomial equation ax2 + bxy + cy2 + d = 0.

If you rotate the coordinate system, then this equation changes dramatically, but the graph does not, and nei-ther does the discriminant$b^{2} - 4ac$. \text{The discriminant} is one invariant. In the general case—a more compli-cated class of polynomials and coordinate changes— there can be many invariants. Mathematicians sus-pected that a finite number of essentially different invariants existed for any given type of polynomial and class of coordinate changes. Was this so? Many mathematicians calculated individual examples industriously. Instead, Hilbert reasoned indirectly: what ifthere is no finite basis for a specific class of polynomials and transformations? He found that it was always possible to produce a contradiction. He concluded that there must be such a basis. At first this result was greeted with disbelief because he did not display a basis. Gordan said, “Das ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist

Theologie.” However, the result was so powerful that ithas been said that it killed algebraic invariant theory. In 1893 Hilbert and Minkowski were asked by the German Mathematical Society to write a report on number theory. Hilbert chose algebraic number theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) and transformed the results of the nineteenth century into the study of algebraic number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields). The deep organizing structure Hilbert found eventually led to what has been called “the magnificent edifice of class field theory” (described in [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871)). lished in 1899 and revised many times, starts with real-number arithmetic. He assumes that it is consistent, i.e., Hilbert’s classic Foundations of Geometry , first pubthat it is free of the possibility of contradictory deduc-tions. Using analytic geometry, he then exhibits a model ofreal numbers; a line is a set of pairs of numbers that euclidean geometry [II.2 §3](/part-02/geometry-origins). A point is a pair of satisfy the equation for a line; a circle. . .; and so on. All of Euclid’s axioms are true statements about these“lines” and “points,” that is, they are true statements about these sets of real numbers. Euclidean geometryis thereby reduced to a fraction of all the true statements about real numbers, and we conclude that if real number arithmetic is consistent then Euclid’s geometryis consistent. Next Hilbert constructs models of various non-Euclidean geometries in terms of euclidean geometry, exploring in depth and with great inventiveness which possible axioms follow from which groups of axioms and which are independent yet consistent.Hilbert was invited to address the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900.He gave a talk proposing twenty-three problems for the new century. These problems are known today as “Hilbert’s problems”; in a sense they have created a vir-tual Göttingen where mathematicians have entered into conversation with Hilbert and each other ever since.Next Hilbert turned to analysis. weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) had found counterexamples to Dirichlet’s principle, which is essentially the assertion that, in variational problems, maxima and minima are always attained. Hilbert proved a modified, but still powerful, version that “salvaged” much of the work that assumed the principle. The larger theme of this period, though, was integral equations and what is now called space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Newton’s equations for motion are dif-hilbert ferential equations, and it was natural to phrase equa-tions in physics that way. However, in many cases it was easier to solve problems if the equations were written using integrals rather than derivatives. Between1902 and 1912 Hilbert attacked a variety of problems

from this direction. He viewed the solutions as part of Hilbert space and gave a spectral interpretation analogous to an infinite-dimensional vector space. Thus, an amorphous sea of functions acquired geometric structure. had some successes, but physics was under going mul-tiple revolutions and was not ready for mathematical In 1910 he turned toward mathematical physics and clarification. was aware that there were contradictions in mathe-When he delivered his problems in 1900, Hilbert matics as it was then phrased, and specifically in settheory. His second problem asked for a proof that first arithmetic, and then set theory, were consistent.As the debate widened, some mathematicians began to pull back on what they accepted as valid reason-ing. Hilbert wanted none of this. By 1918 he was increasingly focused on a program to formally axiom-atize mathematics and prove it free of contradictions using proof-theoretic, combinatorial methods.[VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness theorems in 1930 gödel and thereby showed that Hilbert’s program, at least as initially conceived, could never be successful. Hilbert was wrong here, but even if wrong, his dream of placing mathematics on a formal foundation stimulated some of the most important work of the twentieth century—and mathematics did not pull back.

b. Versailles, France, 1865; d. Paris, 1963 Function theory; calculus of variations; number theory; partial differential equations; hydrodynamics A graduate of the École Normale in Paris, Hadamard obtained a position at the University of Bordeaux in 1893.He returned to Paris in 1897 where he taught at the Collège de France, the École Polytechnique, and the École Centrale until his retirement in 1937. The Hada-mard Seminar at the Collège de France, where mathematicians came from around the world to expound on recent results, was an influential and integral part of mathematical life in France between the wars. with the theory of Hadamard’s first significant papers were concerned holomorphic functions [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of a complex variable, in particular with the analytic continuation of a Taylor series; and in his thesis of 1892 he investigated how the properties of the singu-larities of a series could be deduced from those of its

coefficients. Notably he showed that the radius of con-vergence R of a Taylor series a zn could be given by$R = (\lim n^{→}$\infty$\sup |an|1^{/}n)-1$, a result now known asn the published the formula in 1821 but Hadamard, who Cauchy–Hadamard theorem. (cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) had had discovered it independently, was the first to give acomplete proof.) Further results followed, including the famous “Hadamard gap theorem,” which gives the condition for the circle of convergence of the series to bea natural boundary of the function. His monograph La Série de Taylor et son Prolongement analytique proved especially influential. In 1912 he formulated the(1901) problem of quasi-analyticity for infinitely differentiable functions.The year 1892 also saw the appearance of Hadamard’s prize-winning memoir on entire functions, inwhich he used results from his thesis to establish the relations between the coefficients of the Taylor series of an entire function and its zeros, and then applied themto evaluate the genus of the entire function. He applied this work, and other results from his thesis, to themann zeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), which enabled him, inrie1896, to prove his most famous result: the prime number theorem neo us ly by de la vallée poussin[V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860). (The theorem was proved simulta-[VI.67](/part-06/charles-jean-de-la-valle-poussin-18661962) but in a more complicated way.)Hadamard’s other key achievements of the 1890 s include a well-known inequality concerning determinants holm theory[III.15](/part-03/determinants) (1893), a result essential in the[IV.15 §1](/part-04/operator-algebras) of integral equations; and fred his “three-circles theorem” (1896), which demonstrates the importance of convexity in the study of analytic functions and plays a significant role in interpolation theory.In 1896 Hadamard won the Prix Bordin for his study of the behavior of geodesics on surfaces. (The motiva-tion for studying such geodesics is that they can be used to represent the trajectories of motion in dynamical systems.) It was Hadamard’s first major work ona subject other than analysis. His two papers, one on geodesics on a surface of positive curvature (1897) andthe other on geodesics on a surface of negative curvature (1898), are characterized by a qualitative analysis inherited from results from classical differential geometry, while thepoincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912). The first relies on second is dominated by topological considerations.Prompted by an interest in the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), Hadamard developed the ideas of Volterra’s functional calculus. In 1903 he was the firstto describe linear functionals on a function space. By

considering the space of continuous functions on agiven interval, he showed that every functional is the limit of a sequence of intervals, a result now recognized as a precursor to the riesz representation theorem [III.18](/part-03/distributions) formulated by influential Leçons sur le Calcul de variations riesz [VI.74](/part-06/frigyes-frdric-riesz-18801956) in 1909. Hadamard’s(1910) is the first book in which the ideas of modern functional analysis can be found. concerned with wave propagation, in particular high-In applied mathematics Hadamard was primarily speed flows. In 1900 he began working on the theoryof partial differential equations, and in 1903 published Leçons sur la Propagation des Ondes et les Équationsde l’Hydrodynamique; this was followed by Lectures on Cauchy’s Problem in Linear Partial Differential Equa-tions (1922). The latter contained the details of his fundamental idea of the well-posed problem [IV.12 §2.4](/part-04/analysis) (i.e., a problem in which the solution must not only existand be unique but must also depend continuously on the initial data). The origins of the idea can be found in his 1898 paper on Hadamard’s book geodesics The Psychology of Invention in the[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). \text{Mathematical Fieldsion of the unconscious and its role in mathematical}(1945) \text{is well}-\text{known for its disc us discovery}. \text{Further Reading Hadamard}, J. 1968.Hadamard, \text{four volumes}.

He was a secretary of the committee which forced the abolition of the order of merit in the Mathematical Tripos through a reluctant Senate in1910, and many years later he fought hard for the abolition (not reform!) of the Mathematical Tripos itself, which he considered to be harmful to mathematics inthe United Kingdom. After World War I, Hardy led the British efforts to heal the wounds of the international mathematical community, and with the advent of the Nazi persecutions on the Continent in the early 1930 s, he was an important figure in an extensive network finding jobs for refugee mathematicians in the United States, Britain, and the Commonwealth. He was a great supporter of the London Mathematical Society: he wasnot only one of the secretaries for close to twenty years, but also its president for two terms. Hardy was a militant atheist; as an affectation, he liked to talk of God as his personal enemy. He was agreat conversationali st, and was fond of various intellectual games, like putting together cricket teams ofbores, bogus poets, Fellows of a Cambridge college, and so on. He loved ball games, especially cricket, baseball, bowls (with the curved woods of his college), and real

He had an exceptional gift for collaboration and launching young mathematicians on their research careers.

His poetic book A Mathematician’s Apology, written toward the end of his life, gives a rare insight into the world of a mathematician.

Hilbert’s work had led him to consider infinite matrices, which were then little studied: Riesz wrote the first monograph on them, Les Systèmes d’Équations Linéaires à une Infinité d’Inconnues He also studied the theory of$\text{Lp spaces for} p >(1913)$.1 (that is, spaces of functionsf \text{such that} fp \text{is measure}- integrable over some specified interval) and their dual spaces$L^{q}$, where 1/p + 1/q =1; and he worked on applying his and Fischer’s theorem to the self-dualspace, now known as hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), that is given byp = 2. Later he laid some of the foundations of complete spaces (later known as[III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces)), and applied functional analysis to ergodic banach spaces theory. He summed up much of his work in theseareas in the book Leçons d’Analyse Fonctionnelle (1952), written with his student B. Szökefnalvy-Nagy.All this work constituted important contributions to theories already laid out in principle by various other mathematicians. Riesz achieved groundbreaking work on subharmonic functions: he modified thelet problem [IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis) by allowing the function that di rich extends a given function into a domain to be subhar-monic (“locally less than harmonic”) instead of harmonic. He studied some of the applications of these functions to potential theory. theory, especially types of ordering, continuity, and generalized Heine–Borel covering theorems.

The young Brouwer taught himself modern mathemat-ics, as well as a fair amount of philosophy. As a graduate student he published some original papers on the decomposition of rotations in four-dimensional space.He also published a brief monograph on mysticism that contained a number of ideas that became prominentin his later philosophy. In his dissertation of 1907 he solved a special case of(the elimination of differentiabili ty conditions from the hilbert’s [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) fifth problem axioms offirst program for “constructive mathematics.”lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory)), and he presented his of mathematics The basis of his mathematics was the: the continuum and the natural num-ur-intuition bers are simultaneously created from intuition. Mathe-matical objects (including proofs) are mental creations. After sketching the development of the basic parts of mathematics, Brouwer went on to criticize contemporary mathematics for transcending the bounds of the human mind. In particular, he criticized for introducing sets beyond human recognition, andcantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) Hilbert for the axiomatic method and for formalism. he criticized the latter’s consistency program and denied that “consistency implies existence.” principles,” Brouwer explicitly rejected the principle ofthe excluded middle as unreliable (and also rejected In his 1908 paper “The unreliability of the logical Hilbert’s dogma that “all mathematical problems can besolved in one way or another”). Between 1909 and 1913 Brouwer worked in topology. He continued his workon Lie groups, and noted that topology (in the style of Cantor–Schoenflies) was in need of a sound basis.In his paper “Zur Analysis Situs” (1910), he spelled out a number of notions and examples (curves, indecomposable continua, three domains with one common boundary). This was the beginning of his revision of set-theoretic topology. At the same time he started twolines of research: one on homeomorphisms from surfaces to themselves, establishing rems [V.11](/part-05/fixed-point-theorems) on the sphere and thefixed point theo-plane translation theorem Euclidean plane that have no fixed points); and one on(a character ization of homeomorphisms of the vector distributions on the sphere, yielding existence theorems for singular points, and a character ization of these points. The best-known theorem in this area is Brouwer’s “hairy ball theorem” (no matter how onecombs a hairy ball, there is always a crown). In 1910 Brouwer published a direct topological proof of the Jor-dan curve theorem, which remains one of the most elegant proofs. The so-called new topology opened with Brouwer’s “invariance of dimension” theorem (1910).

800

He then laid the basis for topology of[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), where his basic tool was the Brouwer degree manifolds of continuous mappings. The basic paper is his “Über Abbildungen von mannigfaltigkei ten” (“On mappingsof manifolds,” 1911), which contained most of the tools for the new topology, e.g., simplicial approxi-mation, mapping degree, homotopy [[IV.6 §§2, 3]](/part-04/algebraic-topology), singularity index (in his own terminology), and also the fundamental properties of the new notions.Brouwer’s new topological insights and techniques led him to a wealth of spectacular results: the brouwer fixed point theorem, the invariance-of-domain theorem, the higher-dimensional Jordan theorem, and the definition of dimension, including the soundness proof (that Rn has dimension n). He also applied his invariance-of-domain theorem to the theory of auto-morphic functions and uniformization, thus proving the correctness of the Klein–Poincaré continuity method (1912).During World War I Brouwer returned to the foundations of mathematics; he conceived his mature tion i st ic mathematics [II.7 §3.1](/part-02/foundations-crisis), which fully exploit-intuied the potential of constructive mathematics, based on mentally created objects and notions. The key notions were (infinite) choice sequences (i.e., sequences determined by more or less free choices (by the mathemati-cian) of mathematical objects, say natural numbers), well-orderings, and intuitionistic logic. In “Brouwer’s universe” strong results can be obtained: the “conti-nuity principle,” for example, which says that a function that assigns natural numbers to choice sequencesis continuous (i.e., the output is determined by a finite piece of the (infinite) input); and certain transfinite induction principles, in particular the novel principleof “bar-induction.” With the help of these principles he showed that (i) all real functions on a closed seg-ment are uniformly continuous and (ii) the continuum is indecomposable (cannot be split). This enabled him to refute the principle of the excluded middle in astrong sense: it is not the case that each real number is zero or nonzero. In Brouwer’s universe many classical theorems, such as the intermediate value theorem and the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, fail. “principle of the excluded middle,” but instead it had certain strong constructive principles at its disposal, Brouwer’s mathematical universe lacked the logical which turned it into an alternative to the traditional universe, with a comparable strength. with Hilbert (“intuitionism versus formalism”). In 1928 His foundational program brought him into conflict

Concrete examples include ring axioms [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) or the the ring of all algebraic functions defined on a space(such as a sphere), and the group of all symmetries of a given space.

Her aimwas to show how ideals [III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) and their corresponding homomorphisms could replace equations between elements as the basic tools for stating and proving theorems. (This approach was to come tofruition in the 1950 s, with the advent of grothendieck style homological algebra.)Topologists studied topological spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) by looking at continuous functions from one space toanother.

His first important results on set theory were obtained during World War I, which he spent in Russia: in 191516 he constructed two curves that were among thefirst published examples of fractals, one known now as Sierpi ́nski’s gasket and the other as Sierpi ́nski’s carpet. The latter is the set of all points[0, 1]^2 such that, when written out as base 3 decimals,(x, y) in the square there is no position in which both It is also known as Sierpi ́nski’s universal curve, since it$x and y \text{have a} 1$. contains a homeomorphic image of every planar contin-uum (a continuum is a compact connected set) without interior points. setsbe Borel.

He was critical of Hilbert’s “formalist” program for an axiomatic foundation of mathematics, and explored the possibility of a semi-formalized arithmetical approach to a strictly constructivist foundation of real analysis.

This was one of thefirst monographs on relativity theory and was among the most influential. The book represented only the tip of the iceberg of his contributions to differential geometry and general relativity.

b. Sandsvaer, Norway, 1887; d. Oslo, 1963 Mathematical logic Thoralf Skolem was one of the major logicians of the twentieth century, often a lone voice in his under-standing of the subtle relationship between abstract set theory and logic. He also worked on diophantine equations and on group theory, but his contributions to mathematical logic have proved the most lasting. Hetaught at Bergen and Oslo, was for a time President of the Norwegian Mathematical Society and an editor ofits journal, and in 1954 was named a Knight of the First Class in the Royal Order of St. Olav by the kingof Norway. Polish mathematician Leopold Löwenheim. His conclu-In 1915 Skolem extended a result obtained by the sion (published in 1920 and known as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem) says that if a mathematical theory defined using only the first-order predicate calculus hasa model [IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), then it has a countable model. Here a model is a set of mathematical objects that obeys theaxioms of the theory. Now, the real numbers are definable in such a theory (for example, set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory), or any other axioms for set zermelo–fraenkel theory). From this we obtain the so-called Skolem para-dox, that the real numbers can be defined in a theory with a countable model, even though it had been known since the time ofare uncountable. How can this paradox be resolved?cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) that the real numbers what we mean by “countable.” In this strange count-able model of set theory, we can see that the reals are The answer is that one has to be very careful about countable, but to the model the reals may be uncountable. In other words, the actual enumeration of the realsthat we can see (i.e., the actual bijection between the reals and the natural numbers) may not belong to themodel: the model can be so “small” that it is missing some functions.

theorem and the Skolem paradox. Skolem had real-ized, long before anyone else, that mathematical theories nearly always have several different models. Heargued that there are axiom systems, and one can prove theorems in these settings, but what is meant by the objects that obey these rules will generally vary from case to case. From this he drew the radical conclu-sion that attempts to build mathematics on axiomatic theories were unlikely to succeed (although nowadays, of course, mathematics built on axiomatic foundations has become overwhelmingly successful).Skolem’s insistence on first-order theories, in which variables may range only over elements, not subsets, was one that his contemporaries took time to accept. But that viewpoint, and the great clarity that comes withit, is today the overwhelmingly dominant one. Skolem insisted that the only possible logic to use in any inves-tigation of the foundations of mathematics was firstorder logic [IV.22 §3.2](/part-04/set-theory), and that second-order theories were impermissible in the foundations, precisely because second-order theories allowed the axioms to refer to sets, but the nature of sets was, in his view, one of the topics to be elucidated. Skolem also felt that, while one can talk of individual objects, talk ofobjects of a certain kind can be problematic if it is tooall informal. Indeed, a generation earlier mathematicians had encountered the paradoxes of naive set theory, where loose talk about all sets of certain kinds causes real difficulties: for example, Russell’s paradox of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves (if itis a member of itself, then it is not, but if it is not, then it is).Skolem’s work is also characterized by a distrust of the concept of infinity and a preference for finitistic reasoning. He was an early advocate ofsion [II.4 §3.2.1](/part-02/algorithms), which deals with the theory of what primitive recurare called computable functions, as a way of avoiding paradoxes concerning the infinite.

These have applications ranging from$n = 0 \text{lie theory}$ [III.48](/part-03/lie-theory) to statistical physics. The importance of these identities relates to the fact that the generating function [[IV.18 §§2.4, 3]](/part-04/enumerative-and-algebraic-combinatorics) for$p(n) is \i\text{nf ty}$.$1$- qnn = 0

On the basis of his high school record, he won a scholarship to the Government College in Kumbakonam in 1904.

This book fascinated Ramanujan, who became obsessed with mathematics. In college, he neglected his other subjects and gavehis all to mathematics. Consequently, he failed some subjects and lost his scholarship. By 1913, Ramanu-jan seemed destined for obscurity—he was now a mere clerk in the Madras Port Trust. Friends encouraged himto write to English mathematicians about his mathematical discoveries. Eventually he wrote to G. H. Hardy, who was able to discern that Ramanujan was a truly extraordinary mathematician.Hardy arranged for Ramanujan to travel to England, and between 1914 and 1918 the two of them produced the groundbreaking work described above.In 1918, Ramanujan became ill with a sickness diagnosed as tuberculosis. He convalesced in England for ayear. His health improved a little in 1919 and he was able to return to India. Unfortunately, his health wors-ened after his return, and he died in 1920. During this last year in India he penned the pages now known as Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook and therein laid the foundations of the theory of mock theta functions, a class offunctions similar to but more general than the classical theta functions.

b. Lublinitz, Silesia (then part of Germany, now Poland), 1888; d. New York, 1972 Mathematical physics; partial differential equations; minimal surfaces; compressible flow; shock waves The long and eventful life of Courant was full of high achievements: in mathematical research, the applications of mathematics, as a teacher of many future math-ematicians, as a writer of superb books on mathematics, and as an organizer and administrator of large institutions. The fact that Courant—an outsider in his native Germany and a refugee in the United States—could accomplish these things is a testament to his personality as well as to his scientific outlook.Born in Lublinitz, Courant completed his high school training in Breslau, living on his own and support-ing himself by tutoring. His older Breslau friends, Hellinger and Toeplitz, went on to Göttingen, then themecca of mathematics, and in due course Courant followed them. There he was taken on as an assistantto hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and he began a close friendship with Harald Bohr, which was later extended to Harald’s brother Niels.Under Hilbert’s direction, Courant wrote his dissertation on the use of(on minimizing energy) for constructing conformal dirichlet’s principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis) maps.

One of the fruits of this relationship was the famous “Grundlehren” series of monographs,

affectionately known as the “Yellow Peril.” The third volume in this series is Courant’s exposition of riemann’s [VI.49] geometric view of the theory of analytic functions, combined with Hurwitz’s lectures onelliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). In 1924 the first volume of Courant–Hilbert onit contained, presciently, much of the mathematics Mathematical Physics appeared; needed for Schrödinger’s version of quantum mechanics. His influential calculus book appeared in 1927. His research did not languish; in 1928 he published, jointly with his students Friedrichs and Lewy, the basic paperon the difference equations of mathematical physics. Under Courant’s leadership, Göttingen, where the lively international atmosphere had been destroyed by World War I, became once again an important center for mathematics, as well as physics: the list of visi-tors reads like a Who’s Who of mathematics. This was totally shattered when Hitler took over the government: Jewish professors, Courant among the first, were dis-missed unceremoniously and had to flee or face annihilation. Courant and his family found refuge in New York, where he was invited to build a Graduate School of Mathematics at New York University (NYU). Without any foundation to build on, Courant succeeded in thistask, with the help of his former student Friedrichs and of the American James Stoker, who shared Courant’sscientific ideals. Courant found New York a reservoir of talent, and attracted students such as Max Shiffman, and later Harold Grad, Joe Keller, Martin Kruskal, Cath-leen Morawetz, Louis Nirenberg, and others, including the writer of this article.In 1936, in a burst of creativity, Courant obtained several basic results about minimal surfaces [III.94 §3.1](/part-03/variational-methods) using Dirichlet’s principle. In 1937 he finished the sec-ond volume of Courant–Hilbert. The immensely successful popular book he wrote jointly with Herb Rob-bins, What Is Mathematics?, appeared in 1940.

This unconventional way of doing mathemat-Banach and the mathematicians around him liked ics made the atmosphere of Lwów unique—it is one of the rare cases in mathematics of genuine teamwork among a large group. Turowicz and Ulam noted that (see Kaluza 1996, pp. 62, 74): Banach liked to spend most of his days in a café. Heliked the noise and the music. They did not prevent him from concentrating and thinking. It was difficult tooutlast or outdrink Banach during these sessions. Problems posed right there were discussed, often with nosolution evident even after several hours of thinking.

VI. Mathematicians

The next day Banach was likely to appear with several small sheets of paper containing outlines of proofs he had completed. One day in 1935, Banach proposed that the open prob-lems should be collected in a notebook. This notebook later became famous under the name “The Scottish Book.” In the years 1935–41 over 190 problems from various branches of mathematical analysis were proposed in this notebook, and the collection was published in English in 1957 by Ulam. A version with commentaries was published in 1981 by Birkhäuser as The Scottish Book, Mathematics from the Scottish Café (edited by R. D. Mauldin). (in two volumes, 1929 and 1930; English translation in 1951), Banach was also the author of the books Differential and Integral Calculus (in two vol-Mechanics umes, 1929 and 1930, with several editions in Polish), Introduction to the Theory of Real Functions (in two volumes, written by Banach before the war, although only the first volume remains), and ten textbooks (jointly written with Sto ̇zek and sierpi ́nski [VI.77](/part-06/wacaw-sierpinski-18821969)) for primary and secondary schools on arithmetic, geometry, and algebra (published in the years 1930–36 and reprintedin 1944–47). had three important steps. First, he considered abstract Banach’s famous discoveries in functional analysis linear spaces, where functions are treated like pointsor vectors, sets of functions as function spaces, and operations on functions as operators. Second, he intro-duced the norm·  of a mathematical object, that is, a quantity that in some (possibly abstract) sense describes the length, size, or extent of the object. The distance between two abstract elements given naturally byd(x, y) = x - y . The third impor-x and y is then tant step was to introduce the notion of “completeness” for these spaces. In such general spaces (spaces) he was able to prove several fundamental the - Banach orems, like the uniform boundedness principle, the open mapping theorem, and the closed graph theorem.What these results say, roughly speaking, is that in a Banach space we cannot have bad (pathological) behavior every where—there is always some part of the space where our linear map or other object is well - behaved. lattice, Banach manifold, Banach measure, the Hahn–Names like Banach space, Banach algebra, Banach Banach theorem, the Banach fixed point theorem, the Banach–Mazur game, the Banach–Mazur distance between isomorphic spaces, Banach limits, the Banach–Saks property, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, and
