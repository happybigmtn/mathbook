# Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)

VI.26.    Carl Friedrich Gauss

   For educational use Legendre produced Elements de
Géométrie (1794), an account of euclidean geometry
[I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) that emulated the same kind of form and orga-
nization and standards of proof of the Greek original.
He also handled aspects that had lain out side Euclid’s
concerns, such as alternatives to the parallel postulate,   appointed in the physical modeling. But Laplace also
related numerical issues such as approximations to the
value of π , and a lengthy summary of planar and spher-     tion for infinite bodies, which led Fourier to find, by
ical trigonometry. He produced eleven further editions
up to 1823 and there were further posthumous editions
up until 1839 (which were followed by reprints). It was     ly tique de la Chaleur (1822), which greatly influenced
a very influential book in mathematics education.

Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-
tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian
member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt
(1798–1801), important enough for the First Consul
to make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département
at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor
Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s. There after, Fourier
moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himself
to the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel     we now call it. Despite his prestige and advocacy, he
of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.
   The prefectureship involved heavy commitments,
and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably     few aspects of Laplace’s work on mathematical statis-
discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in
Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone
and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless,
between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his
scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical
study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid
bodies; his “diffusion equation” for this purpose was
not only novel in itself but also marked the first large-
scale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay
out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation
he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These
series were already known but had a low status. Fourier
(re)found many properties: not only the formulas for
their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-
gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how    Gauss’s prodigious mathematical abilities brought him
a periodic series could represent a general function. For   to the attention of the duke of Brunswick when he was

diffusion in a cylinder he found many properties of the
Bessel function J0 (x), which was then little studied.
Fourier presented his findings to the scientific class
of the Institut de France in 1807. lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813)
did not like the series, while laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) was dis-
gave him a clue about solutions of the diffusion equa-
1811, his integral solution (including in version) for
them. His main publication was the book Théorie Ana-
younger mathematicians: for example, the first sat-
is factory proof of the convergence of the series by
dirichlet [VI.36] (1829) and their use in fluid dynam-
ics by C. L. M. H. Navier (1825). Less happy was his
relationship with poisson [VI.27](/part-06/simon-denis-poisson-17811840), who tried to rederive
Ivor Grattan-Guinness   the entire theory following the molecularist physical
principles of Laplace and the methods of solution of
Lagrange, but only added a few special cases.
Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier
Fourier also worked on other topics in mathematics.
As a teenager he gave the first proof of descartes’s
[VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) rule of signs on the numbers of positive and
negative roots of a polynomial equation. (He used an
inductive proof that has now become standard.) He also
found an upper bound on the number of roots within a
given interval, which J. C. F. Sturm improved to an exact
evaluation in 1829. At that time Fourier was trying to
finish a book on equations, which appeared posthu-
mously in 1831 thanks to Navier. The main novelty was
the basic theory of linear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm), as
gained few followers (Navier was one), and the theory
lay dormant for over a century. Fourier also took up a
tics, examining the status of the normal distribution
[III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions).

fifteen, when the duke paid for his further education,
lifting him out of near poverty. For the rest of his life
Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire
to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-
fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person
to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be
discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun.
Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the orig-
inal observations, using the method of least squares,
which he had invented but not published, to predict
where Ceres would reappear. Gauss then assisted for
many years in the analysis of the orbits of several
more asteroids. He also wrote extensively on celestial
mechanics and cartography, and did important work
on telegraphy.
   Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss
will always be remembered. In 1801 he published his
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, the book that created mod-
ern algebraic number theory. In it he gave the first
rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity
[V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), going on to find seven more proofs over the
years. Later he extended the theorem to higher pow-
ers, introducing the Gaussian integers for the purpose
in 1831 (Gaussian integers are numbers of the form
m + ni, where m and n are integers and i = −1). He
did major work on differential equations, chiefly the
hypergeometric equation, which is a second-order lin-
ear differential equation depending on three param-
eters and having two singular points, with the prop-
erty that many of the familiar functions of analysis are    to a telescope in order to transmit a precise beam of
related to its solutions. He showed that this equation
played a significant role in the new theory of ellip-
tic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), but because most of this work
was unpublished it had no influence on the dramatic
and rapidly advancing publications of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and
jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). This unpublished work showed that he
was the first mathematician to see the need to create
a theory of complex functions of a complex variable.
He also gave four proofs of the fundamental the-
orem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra). By the 1820 s he was per-
suaded that physical space might not be Euclidean, but
he confined his opinion to his circle of friends, most
of them astronomers and sympathetic to the idea; the
much more detailed accounts of bolyai [VI.34] and
lobachevskii [VI.31](/part-06/nicolai-ivanovich-lobachevskii-17921856) were published independently in
the early 1830 s. Credit for the first detailed, mathe-
mat ical descriptions of a non-Euclidean space there-
fore rightly attaches to Bolyai and Lobachevskii (for
further discussion of this, see geometry [II.2 §7](/part-02/geometry-origins)). In     (which he did say) and in the apocryphal remark that
1827 Gauss wrote his Disquisitiones Generales Circa

Superficies Curvas, in which the concept of intrin-
sic (Gaussian) curvature of a surface was put for-
ward for the first time, thus reformulating differential
geometry.

In statistics, he was one of the two or three discov-
erers of the normal distribution [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions), and he
was an expert in error analysis, bringing the levels of
accuracy in astronomy to land surveying. In that con-
text he invented the heliotrope, which couples a mirror
light, to improve precision measurement.
The sheer volume of Gauss’s work is overwhelm-
ing. The Werke run to twelve volumes, and there are
several books, of which the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
stands out.
A truly original mathematician and scientist, Gauss
was otherwise a conservative in his tastes and views.
His first marriage ended after only four years with the
death of his wife in 1809; he then married again. A num-
ber of Gauss’s descendants may now be found in the
United States.
Gauss was the last great mathematician to be called
the “Prince of mathematicians,” and he has been ad-
mired as much for his breadth as for the depth of his
insights and the fertility of his ideas. His own view of
mathematics and its importance is captured both in the
much-quoted remark that “mathematics is the queen of
the sciences and arithmetic the queen of mathematics”
“mathematics is the queen and the servant of science.”
