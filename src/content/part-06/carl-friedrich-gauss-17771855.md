Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire
to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-
fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person
to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be
discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun.
Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the orig-
inal observations, using the method of least squares,
which he had invented but not published, to predict
where Ceres would reappear. Gauss then assisted for
many years in the analysis of the orbits of several
more asteroids. He also wrote extensively on celestial
mechanics and cartography, and did important work
on telegraphy.
   Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss
will always be remembered. In 1801 he published his
