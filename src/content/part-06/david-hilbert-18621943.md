hermann weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) described his teacher Hilbert’s
style: “It is as if you were on a swift walk through a
sunny open landscape; you look freely around, demar-
cation lines and connecting roads are pointed out to
you, before you must brace your self to climb the hill;
then the path goes straight up. . . .” Several themes
balance in Hilbert’s career as a mathematician. He
wanted clarity, rigor, simplicity, and depth. Though he
loved mathematics for its beauty, a beauty that tran-
scends human failures, Hilbert saw mathematics as a
social collaboration. A turning point came when he met
minkowski [VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909) and Adolf Hurwitz at university in
Königsberg.
   Hilbert wrote: “On unending walks we engrossed our-
selves in the actual problems of the mathematics of the
time; exchanged our newly acquired understandings,
our thoughts and scientific plans; and formed a friend-
ship for life.” Later Hilbert became professor at Göt-
tingen and, with klein [VI.57], drew mathematicians
from all over the world and turned that small city into a
crossroads for mathematics—until Hitler destroyed it.
   When he was a new Privatdozent, Hilbert decided he
would study mathematics as he taught, and he resolved
never to repeat lectures. He and Hurwitz decided to
embark on a “systematic exploration” of mathematics,
and he followed this pattern for the rest of his life.
Hilbert’s career divides easily into six periods: (i) alge-     there must be such a basis. At first this result was
bra and algebraic invariants (1885–93); (ii) algebraic
number theory (1893–98); (iii) geometry (1898–1902);

(iv) analysis (1902–12); (v) mathematical physics (1910–
22); and (vi) foundations (1918–30). Remarkably, there
is very little overlap. When Hilbert finished a subject,
he was finished with it.
Hilbert’s first breakthrough came in 1888 when he
solved Gordan’s problem, named after Paul Gordan, in
a single bold move. Given a polynomial equation with at
least two variables, some things about the polynomial
change and some do not when you change coordinate
systems. For example, consider the real polynomial
equation
ax 2 + bxy + cy 2 + d = 0.
If you rotate the coordinate system, then this equation
changes dramatically, but the graph does not, and nei-
ther does the discriminant b2 − 4 ac. The discriminant
is one invariant. In the general case—a more compli-
cated class of polynomials and coordinate changes—
there can be many invariants. Mathematicians sus-
pected that a finite number of essentially different
invariants existed for any given type of polynomial
and class of coordinate changes. Was this so? Many
mathematicians calculated individual examples indus-
triously. Instead, Hilbert reasoned indirectly: what if
there is no finite basis for a specific class of polyno-
mials and transformations? He found that it was always
possible to produce a contradiction. He concluded that
greeted with disbelief because he did not display a
basis. Gordan said, “Das ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist
