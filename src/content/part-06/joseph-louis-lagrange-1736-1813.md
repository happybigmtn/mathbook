Paris, 1813 Number theory; algebra; analysis; classical and celestial mechanics In 1766 Lagrange left his native Turin, where he had been a founding member of what would later become the Turin Academy of Sciences, to become the math-ematics direct or at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1787 he moved to Paris to take up a position as asionnaire veteran at the Academy of Sciences. In Parispenhe also lectured at the École Polytechnique, founded in 1794, and served as one of the members of the committee that established the modern metric system.
Lagrange was only nineteen years old when he wrote toplify Euler’s method for finding a curve that satisfied euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) announcing a new formalism to siman extremum condition. Lagrange’s method was based on the introduction of a new differential operator,δ, to express the independent variations of the coordinates of a curve that produced a local infinitesimal deformation.
Using this formalism he derived the differential equation known today as the Euler–Lagrange equation, the fundamental equation of the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). Suppose that we wish to find the function$y = y(x)$ that maximizes or minimizes a definite integral

of the form

bf (x, y, y) dx,

where condition that this function must satisfy:$y = dy/dx^{a}$. The equation states a necessary∂y∂f - ddx ∂y∂f^  = 0.

This is a typical example of Lagrange’s reductionist style. Through out his career he sought suitable for-malisms with which to express and solve the key problems of mathematical analysis. Lagrange publicly presented hisδ-formalism in a memoir published in the second volume (1760–61) of Miscellanea Taurinensia, a review he had helped to found. He coupled this memoir with another in which he used the same formalism to formulate a generalized version of the principle of least action (previously intro-duced by Maupertuis and Euler).
As a result, he was able to derive the equations of motion of any system of dis-tinct bodies attracted by central forces depending on the distances from their centers. ne ns i a sent ing a new approach to the problem of the vibrating Meanwhile, in the first volume of(1759), Lagrange had published a memoir pre-Miscellanea Tauristring, where the string is first represented as a dis-crete system ofn particles, and n is then allowed to tend to infinity.
Using this method Lagrange argued that Euler was right to allow a large class of “func-tions,” both “continuous” and “discontinuous,” as solutions of this problem, where as maintained that only “continuous functions” (that is, d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) had curves expressed by a single equation) could count assolutions.
foundations of classical mechanics in these memoirs. It was based on the interpretation of a continuous Lagrange established a very general program in the system as a limiting case of a discrete one and theuse of the method of indeterminate coefficients: supposing that fic i en ts a (i P (x)= 0, . . . , nis a polynomial in) depend on some indetermi-x, whose coef-i

nates, and that P (x) = 0 for all x (in a given interval), this method consists of deducing the system of equa-tions${a = 0}^{i} = n$, from which the indeterminates are possibly determined. Lagrange extended this method to sums of polynomials in several (independent) vari-$i^{i} = 0$ ables, and (following Euler, d’Alembert, and many oth-ers) also used it with respect to power series. This program was further elaborated in two memoirs on the motion of the Moon (1764, 1780), and later realized in the Méchanique Analitique (1788). Here, the principle

752

of least action was replaced by a generalization of the Bernoullian principle of “virtual velocities,” which were expressed by variations. Using what are now known as generalized coordinates,φ (that is, mutually indepen-i

dent coordinates in the configuration space of a dis-crete system that characterize completely the position of its bodies), Lagrange derived the equations that are now named after him: ddt ∂∂Tφ ̇$i - \partialφ\partial T^{i} + \partialφ\partial U^{i} = 0$, where the system, respectively.

His methods were further developed by laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) in his Mécanique Céleste and formed the basis for subsequent mathematical work in physical astronomy. The method of indeterminate coefficients, or rather its extension to power series, is also the crucial tech-nique underlying Lagrange’s approach to the calculus.
In a memoir which appeared in the Berlin Academy (1768) he used it to prove an important Proceedings of the result connecting the calculus to the theory of algebraic equations, the so-called Lagrange in version theorem, which states that a functionψ(p) of a root p of an equationt - x + φ(x) = 0, where φ(x) is an arbitrary function of Taylor expansions ofx, can be expanded in a series based on theφ(t) and ψ(t) (the precise con- ditions to be satisfied byclarified by cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and Roché).x, φ(x), and ψ(t) were later series and proved that if a

In tions Analytiques (1797) he then showed (or, rather, Théorie des Fonc claimed to have shown), with out making an appeal tothe differential calculus, that any function$f (x + h) can$ be expanded in a power series, and suggested inter-preting the differential formalism as a formalism that applies to the coefficients of$h^{i}/i$! in such an expansion.
In other words, he suggested defining the differential ratios of any order (that is, the ratios d$iy/dx^{i}$, wherey = f (x)) as derivative functions supplying these coef- ficients, where as previously these had been thought ofas genuine ratios of differentials. He also proved that the remainder of a Taylor series could be written in the form now known as the Lagrange remainder.

Paris, 1827 Celestial mechanics; probability; mathematical physics Laplace is known to later mathematicians for many concepts of fundamental importance to mathematics, including the expansion, Laplace’s angles, Laplace’s theorem, laplace laplace transform [III.91](/part-03/transforms), the Laplace functions, inverse probability,[[IV.18 §§2.4, 3]](/part-04/enumerative-and-algebraic-combinatorics), a derivation of the Gauss/legendre generating functions

least-squares rule of error by means of a linear regres-sion, and the laplacian [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or potential function. Laplace developed the fields of celestial mechanics (the phrase was his coinage) and probability, and along theway the mathematics to service and advance them. For Laplace, celestial mechanics and probability were com-ple ment ary instruments that implemented a unified vision of a fully determined universe. Celestial mechanics vindicated the Newtonian system of the world.
Prob-ability was the measure, not of the operations of chance in nature, for there are none, but of human ignoranceof causes, which was to be reduced to virtual certainty by calculation. The third reason for Laplace’s importance to the history of science was the mathematiza-tion of physics in the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Apart from a few formulations—speed of sound, capillary action, refractive indices of gases— his role there was that of instigator and patron rather than of major contributor.
Laplace came up with the majority of the above concepts in a probabilistic context.
 The earliest hints ofthe method of solving difference, differential, and integral equations, later known as the Laplace transform, appeared in “Mémoire sur les suites” (1782 a), where Laplace introduced generating functions. Laplace considered generating functions to be the approach of choice in solving problems that involved the development of functions in series and evaluation of the sums.
Years later, in composingabilités (1812), he subordinated all the analytical part Théorie Analytique des Probto the theory of generating functions and treated the entire subject as their field of application. In the early memoir, however, he emphasized what he expected to be their applicability to problems of nature. In an even earlier paper, “Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements” (1774), laplace stated the theorem permitting the analysis later termed bayesian [III.3](/part-03/bayesian-analysis).
Unknown to Laplace, Thomas Bayes had arrived at the same theorem eleven years earlier but had not developed it. Laplace for his part proceeded, in further investigations over some thirty years, to develop inverse probability into the basis for statistical inference, philosophical causality, estimation of scientific error, quantification of the credibility of evi-dence, and optimal voting rules in the proceedings of legislative bodies and judicial panels. His initial attrac-tion to the approach was its applicability to human concerns.
It was in the course of these papers, most notably “Mémoire sur les probabilités” (1780), that the word probability came to connote not merely the basic

753

quantity in the theory of games and chance but a subject in itself. paper on causality. The problem was to estimate the Laplace first addressed error theory in the above most appropriate mean value to be taken in a series of astronomical observations of the same phenomenon. He also determined how the limits of the error were related to the number of observations (“Mémoire sur les probabilités” above). In “Essai pour connaître la population du Royaume” (1783–91) Laplace turned to demo-graphic applications.
In the absence of census data, one needed to determine the multiplier to be applied to the number of births at any one time in order to estimate the approximate size of a population. The specific problem Laplace solved was the size of the sample required for the probability of error to fall within given limits. Only twenty-five years later did he return to the subject, in the course of preparing the comprehensive Laplace then put probabilistic investigation aside. Théorie Analytique des Probabilitésproblem of determining the mean value from a large.
In 1810 he returned to the number of observations, which he interpreted as the problem of the probability that the mean value falls within certain limits. He proved a law of large numbers, stating that if positive and negative errors in an indefi-nitely large number of observations are assumed to be equally possible, then their mean result converges to alimit in a precise way. From this analysis followed the least-squares law of error.
A priority dispute over the discovery of that law was even then simmering between gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833). Traité de Mécanique Célestethe two part “Mémoire sur la Théorie de Jupiter et de In a long series of investigations brought together in(1799–1825, five volumes), Saturne” (1788) demonstrates the most famous of his findings in planetary astronomy.
He established that the current acceleration in orbital motion of Jupiter andthe deceleration of Saturn are the reciprocal effects of their mutual gravitation, which are cyclical over many hundreds of years and not cumulative. From this and analysis of other phenomena that Laplace explored, it followed that the so-called secular inequalities of plan-etary motions are periodic over many centuries.
Thus, they are not derogations from the law of gravity but evidence that its validity extended beyond the Sun–planet attractions that had been studied by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727). He was never able to prove, however, that lunar acceleration is self-correcting over time. The expansion known by Laplace’s name in the theory of determinants first appears in the background

754

of the Jupiter–Saturn memoir in an analysis of the eccentricities and inclinations of orbits, “Recherches sur le calcul intégral et sur le système du monde” (1776). Except for that, Laplace’s mathematical original-ity is less not able in his analysis of planetary motion than in his development of the theory of probability. More in evidence in his astronomical work is his motivational drive and his power and virtuosity in calculation, which may indeed have been more important through out his long career.
Laplace was masterful in finding rapidly convergent series, in obtaining mathe-mat ical expressions incorporating terms to represent a multitude of physical phenomena, in justifying the neglect of in convenient quantities in order to reach solutions, and in giving the widest possible generality to his conclusions. The attraction exerted by a spheroid on an external or internal point proved to be mathematically the most fertile set of problems in Laplacian planetary astron-omy.
In “Théorie des attractions des sphéroïdes et de la figure des planètes” (1785) Laplace employed dre polynomials [III.85](/part-03/special-functions) in a form later called laplace le gen functions. He also proved a theorem that stated that all ellipsoids with the same foci for their principal sections attract a given point with a force proportional to their masses. Laplace’s angles appear in his development ofthe equation for the attraction of a spheroid on a given point. Laplace used polar coordinates in this analy-sis.
He transformed the equation into one in Cartesian coordinates in “Mémoire sur la théorie de l’anneau de Saturne” (1789). In 1828 George Green dubbed Poisson’s application of the formula to electrostatic and magnetic forces the potential function, the term used there after in classical physics.

Solutions ofthe differential equations involved led him to examine Legendre’s early research concerned the shape of properties of the functions that are named after him; he was in rivalry with Laplace, after whom the func-tions were named during the nineteenth century. His other main concern in analysis, and the longest lasting, was with elliptic integrals. He wrote on them at great length up to a Traité of 1825–28.
But in supplements of 1829–32 he acknowledged that his theory had just been eclipsed by the inverse elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) ofous other (functions defined as) integrals, including the jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) and abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829).

For him the criterion was simply one of minimization;
he didnot make the connections to probability theory that were soon to be effected by[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855). laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) and gauss was the first monograph on this subject. After review-ing Legendre’scontinued fractions Essai sur la Théorie des Nombres[III.22] and the theory of(1798) equations, he focused upon the algebraic branch, solv-ing various Diophantine equations.
Among many properties of integers, he stressed quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), and proved various partition theorems concern-ing quadratic and some higher forms. Little in the book was new; while expanded editions appeared in 1808 and 1830, he had been quickly eclipsed on methods of proof by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) of the young Gauss.

Paris, 1830 Analysis; equations; heat theory Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt (1798–1801), important enough for the First Consul to make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s.
There after, Fourier moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himself to the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.The prefectureship involved heavy commitments, and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless, between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid bodies;
his “diffusion equation” for this purpose wasnot only novel in itself but also marked the first largescale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These series were already known but had a low status. Fourier (re)found many properties: not only the formulas for their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how a periodic series could represent a general function.

But Laplace also gave him a clue about solutions of the diffusion equation for1811, his integral solution (including in version) for infinite bodies, which led Fourier to find, by them.
His main publication was the booklytique de la Chaleur (1822), which greatly influenced Théorie Anayounger mathematicians: for example, the first sat-is factory proof of the convergence of the series by dirichlet i cs by C.

As a teenager he gave the first proof of[VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) rule of signs on the numbers of positive and Fourier also worked on other topics in mathematics.descartes’s negative roots of a polynomial equation. (He used aninductive proof that has now become standard.) He also found an upper bound on the number of roots within agiven interval, which J. C. F. Sturm improved to an exact evaluation in 1829. At that time Fourier was trying to finish a book on equations, which appeared posthumously in 1831 thanks to Navier.
The main novelty wasthe basic theory of linear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm), as we now call it. Despite his prestige and advocacy, he gained few followers (Navier was one), and the theory lay dormant for over a century.

fifteen, when the duke paid for his further education, lifting him out of near poverty. For the rest of his life Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun. Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the original observations, using the method of least squares, which he had invented but not published, to predict where Ceres would reappear.

In 1801 he published his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss, the book that created modern algebraic number theory. In it he gave the first rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), going on to find seven more proofs over the years.
Later he extended the theorem to higher powers, introducing the Gaussian integers for the purpose in 1831 (Gaussian integers are numbers of the formm + ni, where m and n are integers and i = . qrt{-1}). He did major work on differential equations, chiefly the hypergeometric equation, which is a second-order linear differential equation depending on three parameters and having two singular points, with the prop-erty that many of the familiar functions of analysis are related to its solutions.
He showed that this equation played a significant role in the new theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), but because most of this work was unpublished it had no influence on the dramatic and rapidly advancing publications of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and jacobi was the first mathematician to see the need to create[VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). This unpublished work showed that he a theory of complex functions of a complex variable.
He also gave four proofs oforem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra). By the 1820 s he was per-the fundamental thesuaded that physical space might not be Euclidean, buthe confined his opinion to his circle of friends, most of them astronomers and sympathetic to the idea; the much more detailed accounts of lobachevskii [VI.31](/part-06/nicolai-ivanovich-lobachevskii-17921856) were published independently in bolyai [VI.34] and the early 1830 s.
Credit for the first detailed, mathe-mat ical descriptions of a non-Euclidean space therefore rightly attaches to Bolyai and Lobachevskii (for further discussion of this, see1827 Gauss wrote his Disquisitiones Generales circa geometry [II.2 §7](/part-02/geometry-origins)). In

From the mid 1810 s he challenged the new theories of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (especially the solving of differential equationsby trigonometric series and the Fourier integral) and ofanalysis using limits, and his innovation of complex-cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) (the new approach to real-variable variable analysis). His over all achievements were much less significant than theirs: the main novelties were the “Poisson integral,” which embedded Fourier series within a power series; and a summation formula.
He also studied the general and singular solutions of differential, difference, and mixed equations. that all physical phenomena were molecular, and that the cumulative action upon a molecule of all its com-In physics Poisson tried to justify Laplace’s claim panions should be expressed mathematically in terms of an integral. He applied this approach to heat diffusion and to elasticity theory by the mid 1820 s, but then decided that integrals should be replaced by sums; he elaborated this alternative especially in capillary theory (1831).
Curiously, molecularism did not dominate his most important contributions to physics: to electrostatics (1812–14) and to magnetic bodies and the process of magnetization (1824–27). His mathemat-ical contributions to these topics included modifying Laplace’s equation to what we now call Poisson’s equa-tion, which deals with the potential at points inside a charged body or region of charge (1814); and also adivergence theorem (1826).

Lagrange developed the brackets theory (named after them) of canonical solutions to the equations of mo-In mechanics, between 1808 and 1810 Poisson and tion. Poisson’s motivation was to extend, to second-order terms in masses of the planets, Lagrange’s superb attempt to prove that the planetary system was sta-ble; in later work he examined this (first-order) problem specifically, as well as other aspects of perturbation theory.
He also analyzed rotating bodies by using moving frames of reference (1839), in an analysis that was to inspire Léon Foucault to propose his famous long pendulum in 1851. His best-known publications include a substantial and wide-ranging two-volume Traité de Mécanique (editions in 1811 and 1833), which did not, however, have room for Louis Poinsot’s beau-tiful recent theory (1803) of the couple in statics. In the mid 1810 s, he studied deep-body fluid dynamics, in rivalry with Cauchy.
Poisson was one of the few contemporaries to take up Laplace’s work in probability theory and mathe-mat ical statistics. He studied various probability distributions(1837, rather in passing) but also the so-called Cauchy[III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions): not only the one named after him (1824) and Rayleigh (1830) distributions. He also examined proofs of theand formulated the law of large numbers central limit theorem [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions),[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) (his term).
One of his main applications was to the old problem of determining the probability that a triad of judges would come to the correct decision in court cases (1837).

The value(nonempty) set of numbers with the property not-u in this formulation is a lower bound for the M. Bolzano’s lemma is therefore equivalent to what nowadays might be called the “greatest lower bound” axiom(or, more commonly and equivalently, the “least upper bound” axiom).
It is also equivalent to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (that every bounded infinite set in R, or more generally Rn, has an accumulation point).

Another major innovation of Cauchy dates from 1814, when he began to create complex-variable analysis. Initially the integrand was a complex function butthe limits of integration were real; however, from 1825 on they too became complex, and in this form he found many theorems on the residues of functions over closed domains of various shapes. Unusually for him, his progress was fitful, and he cast the theory in terms of the complex plane only in the mid 1840 s.

He showed in this way how points can be described by a homogeneous triple of coordin-ates, lines can be described by linear equations, the concept of cross-ratio can be introduced, and the duality of points and lines in the plane can be handled algebraically. He also introduced a Möbius net, which is the projective equivalent of squared paper in cartesian geometry.
His work is all the more remarkable because Möbius knew very little of Poncelet’s radical reinven-tion of projective geometry only a few years before. In its turn his work was for a time overshadowed by Jakob Steiner’s synthetic treatment of projective geometry of 1832, and then Plücker’s two books on algebraic curves in the 1830 s, but the simplicity and generality of Möbius’s methods were important in establishing projective geometry as a rigorous mainstream subject.
In the 1830 s Möbius developed a geometrical theory of statics and the composition of forces, and it was inthis connection that he showed that where as duality in plane geometry necessarily gives rise to a conic, duality in space need not. Möbius’s study of duality in space, which pairs points with planes, led him to consider the set of all lines in space, which is a four-dimensional space.
It pleased the educator Rudolf Steiner very much that the ordinary three-dimensional space may also be thought of as a four-dimensional space, because Steiner’s philosophy was directed against breaking what he saw as a stranglehold of orthodox teaching.

Kazan, Russia, 1856 Non-Euclidean geometry Lobachevskii came from a poor background, but his mother was able to have him enrolled at the local Gymnasium (or high school) on a scholarship in 1800.In 1805 the Gymnasium was made the kernel of the new University of Kazan, and in 1807 lobachevskii began to study there. The university had just appointed Martin Bartels as Professor of Mathematics, and Bar-tels not only trained Lobachevskii well, but protected him from trouble with the authorities when Lo bac hev-skii was suspected of atheism.
Eventually, Lobachevskii graduated not with the ordinary degree but with a Master’s qualification, and his career as a professional mathematician began. In 1826, after a reform of the university, Lobachevskii gave a public lecture: “On the principles of geom-etry, with a rigorous demonstration of the theory of parallels.” The manuscript of this talk is now lost, butit probably marked the start of Lobachevskii’s awareness of a non-Euclidean geometry.

Loba-che vskii called these the parallels to the given line through the given point. Starting from this definition, he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles, and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the triangles are very small.
He extended his results todescribe a geometry of three dimensions, thus making it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to measure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account of space than Euclidean geometry. He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-grad ski i, a much better known mathematician in Saint Petersburg.

In this work, “potential function” (a term that he himself coined), he proved the three-dimensional version of the theorem now named after him, and introduced the concept that riemann [VI.49] later called Green’s function (1860).

His father—a minister of the church in Norway, but also at one timea government minister—over reached himself and when VI.33. Niels Henrik Abel he died he left the family in straitened circumstances. Abel’s exceptional intellectual talents were recognized at school, and funds were raised to enable him to complete his education and, in particular, to study mathe - matics.
At age twenty - two, he was awarded a scholarship to make a two-year tour of Europe, during which he studied in Berlin and Paris. In Berlin he met and was befriended by Auguste Crelle, the engineer who had just founded thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange - Crelle’s Journal li shed in the first four volumes of the journal. From). Almost all of Abel’s mathematical work was pub1826 until his death in 1829 Abel eked out a poor existence, earning a little by teaching, but using what few resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother.
He died of consumption at the ageof twenty-seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin. Abel’s main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas. The first of these was the theory of equa - tions. Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) in 1770 and cauchy [VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) in 1815 about the form of functions of the roots of an equa - tion, and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted.
Lagrange had hinted at the possi-bility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between 1799 and 1814 trying to prove this, though he had not managed to persuade his contemporaries. Abel’s first success was to give an accept-able proof of the fact that, for polynomial equations of degree 5, there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution.
This first appeared in 1824 in a short pamphlet written in French and published privately in Christiania (Oslo). Once Abel reached Berlin, however, Crelle translated itinto German and published it in the first volume of his journal; he also published a fuller, more detailed account, covering polynomials of any degree greater than 4, in 1826.Abel returned to equations a few years later, publishing a long paper in 1829 about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions.
His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as a function of every other root, the second that these functions commute (in modern terms, the[V.21](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - quintic) of the equation is commutative). He proved var-galois group ious theorems about such equations, the most striking 761 being that they are soluble by radicals.
This represented an extensive generalization of the ideas described by gauss met ic ae[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) in the seventh part of, where the special case of cyclotomic equations Disquisitiones Arith(which satisfy both of these conditions) is treated sys - tematically. It was in honour of this work that, later, the adjective “Abelian” was applied to groups that are commutative. It is important to appreciate, however, that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations with out any appeal to groups, which at that time were not yet known. convergence.
Although there had been over a century of critical thinking devoted to foundations of the cal-He also made major contributions to the theory of culus, modern ideas of rigour were only just emerg-ing in the writings of bolzano [VI.28](/part - 06/bernard - bolzano - 17811848), Cauchy, and others. Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy’s lectures of 1820–21, but series in general, and power series in particular, were still far from well understood.
Among other contributions, Abel offered a proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers, and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel’s limit theorem. Perhaps his greatest discoveries, however, were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together. To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words:
first, a new and productive approach to the theory ofa vast generalization of elliptic functions to what are elliptic functions [V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem); and, second, now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals. Inthis area Abel competed for priority with jacobi [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851). Most (though by no means all) of his work was written in two memoirs.
One was published in two parts,“Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques” and “Précis d’une théorie des fonctions elliptiques,” coming to well over two hundred pages in Crelle’s Journal in 1828 and 1829. The other, entitled “Mémoire sur une propriété générale d’une classe très étendue de fonctions tran - scendantes,” was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October 1826. There it lay on Cauchy’s desk, unread until after Abel’s death. It was published by the Paris Academy in 1841. The manuscript itself, however, was stolen by G.

Probably inspiredby his father’s attempts to prove the parallel postulate, a key assumption in Euclidean geometry, but very much against the advice of his father, János also attempted to prove it. But in 1820 he switched direction and attempted to show that there could be a geom-etry independent of the parallel postulate. By 1823 he believed he had succeeded, and after much subsequent discussion father and son agreed to publish the son’s ideas as a twenty - eight-page appendix to his father’stwo-volume work on geometry in 1832.

He also found a surface inhis three-dimensional geometry in which geometry is Euclidean. He concluded that there were logically two geometries and that it remained undecided which one corresponded to reality.
He also showed that in his new geometry it was possible to construct a square equal inarea to a given circle, thus accomplishing a feat that was widely (and, as was later shown, correctly) believed to be impossible in Euclidean geometry. A copy of the book was sent to gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), who eventually replied on March 6, 1832, that he could not praise the work, for “to praise it, would be to praise myself,” going on to claim that the methods and results in the appendix agreed with his own work over the pre-vious thirty-five years, although he was

He was baptized dur-ing his first year at the University of Berlin in 1821, probably in order to make it possible for him to follow an academic career at a time when Jews were ineligible for academic positions. Jacobi studied classics under the famous philologist Boeckh and philosophy under Hegel. Owing to the mediocrity of the mathematics VI.35.
Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi staff in Berlin at that time, he was self-taught inthe discipline, which soon became his favorite. He read euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783), lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813), laplace [VI.23](/part - 06/pierre - simon - laplace - 17491827), gausscians like Pappus and Diophantus. In 1825, Jacobi was[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), and, last but not least, Greek mathemat i awarded his doctorate for a thesis, written in Latin, on the theory of functions.
The subsequent disputatio (discussion) included critical comments both on Lagrange’s theory of functions and on his analytical mechanics. The following year Jacobi went to the University of Königsberg, where (in 1829) he got a full pro - fessorship. In 1834, he and the physicist F. E.
Neumann founded the “Königsberg mathematical physics seminar,” which, because of the close connection between research and teaching that it fostered, soon led to Königsberg becoming the most successful and influ-ential educational institution for theoretical physics and mathematics in the German-speaking part of the scientific world. By 1844, when Jacobi left Königsberg because of poor health and in order to become a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, he was rec-ognized as Germany’s most important mathematician after Gauss.
After seven more fruitful years of researchin Berlin he died unexpectedly from smallpox. mathematics, conceiving mathematical thinking as ameans of developing the human intellect and, indeed, Through out his life Jacobi was an advocate of pure of advancing humanity itself. He published his first paper in 1827: it was devoted to number theory (cubic residues) and was influenced by Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae higher residues, the division of the circle, quadratic. Further investigations were devoted to forms, and related subjects.
Many of Jacobi’s results in number theory were published in the book Canon arithmeticus divisibility to algebraic numbers by Jacobi and Gauss(1839). The extension of the concept of paved the way for the later algebraic theory of numbers(by kummer [VI.40] and others). ofelliptic functions Jacobi’s “most original achievements” (in the words klein [VI.57]) were his contributions to the theory of[V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem), which developed in competition with ing with legendre abel [VI.33](/part - 06/niels - henrik - abel - 18021829) between 1827 and 1829.

Jacobi’s research on elliptic functions culminated in the book ca rum Fundamenta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ellipti-(1829).
Together with Abel he should be viewed as one of the founders of the theory of complex func - 763 tions, which emerged in the second half of the century. In particular, his application of research on elliptic functions to Diophantine equations became important for the development of analytic number theory.
Jacobi’s contributions to algebra include investigations into the theory of determinants (the “Jacobi an” functional determinant) and their relation to inverse functions, into quadratic forms (“Sylvester’s law of inertia”), and into the transformation of multiple integrals. Even Jacobi’s work in mathematical physics bears the stamp of “pure mathematics”:
following the analytical tradition of Euler and Lagrange, he presented the foundations of mechanics in an abstract and formal man - ner, paying special attention to the relation between conservation laws space and to the unifying role of variational princi-[IV.12 §4.1](/part - 04/analysis) and symmetries of ples.
Jacobi’s achievements in this area, which he devel-oped in close relation to the theory of differential equations and the what is now called the “Jacobi–Poisson theorem,” the calculus of variations [III.94](/part - 03/variational - methods), include “principle of the last multiplier,” a theory for inte-grating hamilton’s [VI.37](/part - 06/william - rowan - hamilton - 18051865) canonical equations of motion Jacobi theory”), and a time-independent formulation of[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part - 04/mirror - symmetry) by transformation (“Hamilton the principle of least action (“Jacobi’s principle”).
His approach to these areas and the results he obtained are documented in two comprehensive books based on his lectures: Vorlesungen über Dynamik (1866) and Vorlesungen über Analytische Mechanik until 1996). The former had considerable impact on the(not published development of German mathematical physics in the last third of the nineteenth century.
The latter reveals Jacobi’s criticism of the traditional understanding of mechanical principles (as laws that are firmly based on empirical observation or a priori reasoning) and shows strong parallels with the “conventionalist” viewpoint, which did not become popular in science and philos-ophy until half a century later, when it numbered H.

The following year he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed as a professor at the military academy and where he was also allowed to teach at the university.
In 1831 he was made a professor at the university and from then on held positionsat both institutions until 1855, when he was appointed as the success or to Göttingen. gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) at the University of His guiding star was Gauss’s pioneering Dirichlet’s primary interest was in number theory. Disquisitiones arithmetic aeber theory into a mathematical discipline—which he(1801)—the work that made num studied through out his career.
Dirichlet was not only the first mathematician to completely understand this work but he also became its interpreter, picking upits problems and improving its proofs, as well as developing its ideas. 1825, Dirichlet came to international prominence.
The paper, which dealt with Diophantine equations of the With his very first publication, which appeared in formx5 + y5 = Az5, yielded substantial results for the verification ofcasen = 5 (these results were used by fermat’s last theorem legendre[V.10](/part - 05/fermats - last - theorem) for the[VI.24](/part - 06/adrien - marie - legendre - 17521833) for a complete proof for that case some weeks later). Ina paper published in 1837 Dirichlet came up with the new and revolutionary idea of applying analytical meth-ods to number theory.
He introduced expressions that are now known as series of the form Dirichlet L-series. These are infinite

many prime numbers. In two subsequent papers, pub-lished in 1838 and 1839, he used his new methods, among other things, to determine the formula of the class number of binary quadratic forms: that is, the number of proper classes of forms of given determinant. It is often said that these three papers mark the start of analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Dirichlet also made important contributions to algebraic number theory, culminating in hisrem [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) for the Abelian group of units in an alge-unit theobraic number field.
These contributions, together with numerous others due to him (e.g., his Sc hu bf a ch pr inz ip, or box principle; work on the law of biquadratic reciprocity; and results concerning Gaussian sums), were brought together in his influential Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie by his former student(lectures on number theory), published dedekind [VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in 1863.
Inspired by his close contact with fourier [VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) during his student days in Paris, Dirichlet’s other main interests were in analysis and mathematical physics, and in the connections between them. In a ground-breaking paper of 1829, Dirichlet not only gave the first strict proof of the convergence of a Fourier series under given conditions, but he also used new methods and concepts (e.g., his insight into the importance of conditional convergence of series;
his Dirichlet function influencing the development of the concept of a function) that became classic and that served as a basis for count less nineteenth - century investigations on analy - sis. He also occupied himself with the determination of multiple integrals as well as with the expansion ofa function into spherical functions (Kugelfunktionen) and applied these results to problems in mathematical physics.
His main contributions to mathematical physics include papers on the theory of heat, hydrodynamics, the gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid, the$n$-body problem, and potential theory. The first boundary-value problem (the “Dirichlet problem” of finding the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region) had already been handled by Fourier and others, but Dirichlet proved the uniqueness of the solution, while the dirichlet principle ing boundary problems for[IV.12 §3.5](/part - 04/analysis)

Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school, his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind, Eisen - stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), and riemann [VI.49], among others.

Hamilton developed his approach to optics over the following five years, pub-li shing three substantial supplements to his original paper. He showed that the properties of an optical sys-tem are completely determined by a certain “characteristic function” that is a function of the initial and final coordinates of a ray of light and which measures the time of passage of light through the system.
In 1832 he predicted that light falling at a certain angle on a biax-ial crystal would be refracted to form a hollow cone of emergent rays. This prediction was verified by his friend and colleague Humphrey Lloyd. 765 dynamics. In a paper “On a general method in dynam - ics” (1834), he showed that the dynamics of a system Hamilton adapted his optical methods to the study of of attracting and repelling point particles is completely determined by a certain characteristic function, which satisfies a differential equation, today referred to asthe hamilton–jacobi equation [IV.12 §2.1](/part -

In a subsequent paper, “Second essay on a general method in dynamics” (1835), he introduced the tion of a dynamical system, presented the equations principal funcof motion of such a system in[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part - 04/mirror - symmetry), and adapted methods of perturbation hamiltonian form theory to this setting.

Most of his subsequent math-ematical work involved quaternions. It is not difficult to translate much of this work into the language of modern vector analysis, and indeed many of the basic concepts and results of vector algebra and analysis emerged from Hamilton’s work on quaternions.
Hamil-ton applied quaternion methods to the study of dynamics in a series of short papers published in the three years immediately following his discovery of quaternions. He also investigated a number of algebraic sys-tems related to quaternions. However, most of his work with quaternions was concerned with their application to the study of geometrical problems, and, in particular, to the study of surfaces of the second order and (especially in the final years of his life) to the study of the differential geometry of curves and surfaces.
Much of this research is to be found in his two books Quaternions (1853) and Elements of Quaternions Lectures on(1866, published posthumously). Further Reading Hankins, T.

He taught analysis and mechanics at his alma mater, the École Polytechnique, until 1851, when he became professor at the Collège de France. More over, he was professor at the Sorbonne from 1857 and member of the Paris Academy of Sciences and the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1836 he founded the Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquéesthis day.
, which exists to His wide-ranging research was often inspired by physics. For example, his early theory of differential operators of the form(d/dx)k, where k is an arbitrary complex number, had its origin in Ampère’s electro - dynamics. Similarly, Sturm–Liouville theory, which he developed in around 1836 with his friend C. F. Sturm, was inspired by the theory of heat conduction.
Sturm Liouville theory deals with a linear self-adjoint second-order differential equation involving a parameter that must be chosen so that there exist nontrivial solutions(eigenfunctions) that satisfy given boundary-value conditions. Liouville’s main contribution to this theory wasa proof that an “arbitrary” function has a convergent “Fourier expansion” in terms of eigenfunctions. Sturm Liouville theory was a major step toward a more qual-it ative theory of differential equations, and the first work on spectral theory of a general class of differential operators.

an ellipsoid of revolution and an ellipsoid with three different axes. Liouville showed that Jacobi was right, and more over proved the surprising result that only the latter fig-ure is in stable equilibrium.

Arrested on Bastille Day (14 July) 1831, he spent the next eight months in prison for flouting authority again. He emerged at the end of April 1832 but some how got himself challenged to a duel. On 29 May he edited his manuscripts and wrote a summary of his dis-coveries in a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The duel took place the next morning and he died on 31 May1832. Much has been written about him.

The first to be published was “Sur la théorie des nombres,” which appeared in April 1830 and contains the theory of Galois fields.
These are analogues of the complex numbers obtained by adjoining to the integers modulo a prime numberp a root of an irreducible poly- nomial congruence modulo of the basic features of what later became the theory ofp. The paper contains most finite fields. In the letter to Chevalier written on the eve of the duel, Galois mentions three memoirs.
The first, now known as thet led “Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations Premier Mémoire, is a manuscript entipar radicaux.” Galois submitted work on the theory ofequations to the Paris Academy on 25 May and 1 June 1829, but this is now lost and it seems quite possible that Galois with drew it on the advice of Cauchy (towhom it had been given to referee) in January 1830.
In February 1830 he resubmitted his work in compe-tition for the Grand Prix de Mathématiques, but his manuscript was unfortunately and mysteriously loston the death of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (and the prize was awarded jointly to jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851)).

when the abstract notion of field developed later in the nineteenth century, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fields had already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois theory developed directly out of the material in the Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed from the ideas in the Mémoire together with a series of papers published by Premier Mémoire and the Second Cauchy in 1845.

He worked as an actuary in London in the1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by passing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some six years in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-ics, in England and in the United States.
Most notably, Sylvester served as the first Professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold professorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health forced his retirement in 1894.

Sylvester followed this up with what he called the dialytic method of elimination:
a new criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detecting whether two polynomial equations have a common root (1841).His next major research push came in the 1850 s when, together with theory of invariants. This involved an associated and cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More concretely, given a binary form of a particular degree, Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for explicitly finding invariants and covariants of that form and for determining algebraic relations, or
“syzygies,” between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two important papers: “On the principles of the calculus of forms” (1852) and “On a theory of the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions” (1853). In the latter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law of inertia: if$Q(x^{1}$, . . . , xn) is a real quadratic form [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rankr , then there exists a (real) nonsingular

However, he then entered a fallow period that ended only with his move to Baltimore.
While there, he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the problem of inductively determining, for binary forms first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4, etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generating set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordan had proved that this number is always finite and, in so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley, who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, the binary form of degree 5) was infinite.
By 1879, Sylvester had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly independent covariants associated with a binary form of any given degree. Sylvester was the founding editor of the American Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80), and on matrix algebras
(1884), appeared there.

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested inbuilding telescopes and scientific instruments than making shoes—the result being that his business failed and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen and take a job as a junior teacher to support his parents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and together they built functioning scientific instruments.
Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age of twenty he was publishing original research in calculus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to others such asto develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded the cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on operators in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-ics to be presented by the society.
The paper was important not only because it contained (arguably forthe first time) a clear definition of the concept of an operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as differentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as an object in its own right. There was an explicit similarity between the laws he derived for functions of D and the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss below.

It was there that here wrote and expanded his ideas in a book entitled In 1849 Boole was appointed Professor of Mathe-An Investigation of the Laws of Though the introduced a new type of algebra, an algebra of(1854), in which logic, which evolved into what we now call Boolean 770 algebra.
From his earlier study of languages, he real-ized that there were mathematical structures concealed in everyday speech. For example, the class of European men, together with (i.e., union) the class of European women, is the same as the class of European men and women. By using letters to represent a class, or set, of objects, he could write the above asz(x + y) =zx + zy , where the letters x, y, and z represent the class of men, the class of women, and the class of all Europeans, respectively.
Here addition is to be understood as union, at least for disjoint classes like menand women, and multiplication is to be understood as intersection. The principal laws of Boole’s algebra are commutativity, distributivity, and the law which he called the“fundamental law of duality” and which is represented byx2 = x. This law can be interpreted by observing that the class of all white sheep intersected with the class of all white sheep is still the class of all white sheep.
Unlike his other laws, all of which apply to ordi-nary numerical algebra, this law applies to numerical algebra only when x is 0 or 1. that the study of well-defined classes or sets of objects is capable of precise mathematical interpretation and is Boole broke with traditional mathematics by showing indeed fundamental to mathematical analysis. In sim-ple cases, his approach also reduces classical logic to symbolic mathematical form.
Using the symbols 0 and1 to denote “nothing” and “universe” respectively, and denoting the complement of the class x by 1 - x, he derived (from the law of duality) the law$x(1 - x) = 0$, which represents the impossibility of an object simul-taneously possessing and not possessing a given property, otherwise known as the principle of con tr adic-tion. Boole also applied his calculus to the theory of probability. Boole’s algebra lay dormant until 1939, when Shannon discovered that it was the appropriate language for describing digital switching circuits.
Boole’s work thus became an essential tool in the modern development of electronics and digital computer technology. ematics: differential equations, difference equations, Boole also made several other contributions to math operator theory, calculus of integrals, etc. His text-books on differential equations (1859) and finite differences (1860) include much of his original research and are still in print today, but he is best remembered as the father of symbolic logic and one of the foundersof computer science.

VI.44 Karl Weierstrass

b. Ostenfelde, Germany, 1815; d. Berlin, 1897 Analysis Weierstrass began his career studying finance and administration at the University of Bonn but his real interest was mathematics and he did not complete his course. He qualified as a teacher and taught in gym-nasia for fourteen years. The turning point in his life occurred when, at the age of almost forty, he publisheda ground-breaking paper on Abelian functions, in which he solved the problem of in version of hyperelliptic inte-grals. Shortly afterward he was offered a position at the University of Berlin.
He demanded of himself the very strictest standards, with the result that he published little. His ideas, and his reputation, spread through his excellent lectures, which drew students and established mathematicians from around the world. Weierstrass has been described as the “father of modern analysis.” He contributed to all branches of the subject: calculus, differential and integral equa-tions, the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), infinite series, elliptic and Abelian functions, and real and com-plex analysis.

But cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) there were several major foundational problems with his approach:
verbal definitions of limit and continuity; frequent use of infinitesimals; and intuitive appeal to geometry in proving the existence of various limits. Weierstrass and dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) (among others) determined to remedy this unsatisfactory situation, and set themselves the goal of establishing theorems in a “purely arithmetic” manner, as Dedekind put it. To that end, Weierstrass gave preciseε–δdefinitions ofwe still use today), thus banishing infinitesimals from limit [I.3 §5.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and continuity [I.3

He also defined the real numbers based on the robinson [VI.95](/part-06/abraham-robinson-19181974) some hundred years rationals (although Dedekind’s and cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) approaches proved more accessible). He was there by largely responsible for the “arithmetization of analysis” (a term coined byable contributions to real analysis are his introduction klein [VI.57]). Among his remark of uniform convergence (introduced independently by P. L.
Seidel) and his example of an every where-contin-uous and no where-differentiable function (Cauchy and his contemporaries believed that a continuous function was differentiable except possibly at isolated points). Both riemann [VI.49] and Weierstrass (succeeding Cauchy) founded complex function theory, but they had fundamentally different approaches to the subject.
Riemann’s global, geometric conception was based onthe notion of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and on the dirichlet principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis), while Weierstrass’s local algebraic theory was grounded in power series and analytic continuation [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). “The more I ponder the principles of function theory—and I do so incessantly—the more I am convinced that it must be founded on simple algebraic truths. . .,” he asserted in a letter to H. A. Schwartz.
He severely criticized the Dirichlet principle for being mathematically not wellgrounded, and produced a counterexample, after which his approach to complex analysis became dominant until the early twentieth century. Klein commented on Weierstrass’s general approach to mathematics: “[He]is first of all a logician; he proceeds slowly, systematically, step - by - step.
When he works, he strives for the definitive form.” Weierstrass’s name is attached to various concepts and results, among them the theorem, which says that a continuous function can be Weierstrass approximation uniformly approximated by polynomials; the Weierstrass theorem, which states that every infinite, bolzano bounded set of real numbers has a limit point; the Weierstrass factorization theorem re sent at i on of an entire function in terms of an infinite, which gives the rep product of “prime functions”;
the theorem, which says that in every neighborhood of an Casorati–Weierstrass isolated essential singularity an analytic function takes values arbitrarily close to any assigned complex num - ber; the Weierstrass M - test, which deals with the com- paris on of series for convergence; and the℘-function, an example of an elliptic function Weierstrass[V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem) of order 2. functions, and much of his fame in the nineteenth cen-Weierstrass was most proud of his work on Abelian 771 tury rested on it.

Scientific Committee of the Ministry of Education (1856) Fascinated by Watt’s parallelogram (the linkage used in steam engines) and the problem of converting circular motion into rectilinear motion, Chebyshev embarkedon a deep study of the theory of hinge mechanisms. In particular, he sought the linkage that would produce the minimum deviation from a straight line over a given range. This corresponds to the mathematical problem of finding, from among the class of functions chosen to approximate a given function, the one with the smallest absolute error for all specified values of the argument.
It was in this context, in particular considering the approximation of functions by polynomials, that Chebyshev discovered the polynomials now named after him (see [III.85](/part - 03/special - functions)).

Cambridge, England, 1895 Algebra; geometry; mathematical astronomy At the beginning of his career in the 1840 s, Cayley laid down subjects that in formed much of his later research. The novelties of his very first undergraduate paper, “On a theorem in the geometry of position”(1841), are the now-standard notation for determinants the introduction of the[III.15](/part - 03/determinants) of arrays set between vertical lines and Cayley–Menger determinant.

In astronomy he contributed to the theory of ellipan assiduous attention to detail.
His work on the lunar theory was noteworthy, and in one long calculation he helped to settle an Anglo-French controversy by veri-fying the correct value for the secular acceleration of the Moon, which had been established by John Couch Adams in 1853. Cayley returned to the academic world in 1863 as the founding Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathemat-ics at Cambridge. In 1868 Paul Gordan startled invariant theorists by proving that invariants and covariants of a binary quantic could be expressed in terms of a finite ley’s but, undaunted, he completed his series with a list-basis.
This contradicted an earlier result of Caying of the irreducible invariants and covariants of the binary form of order 5 (the binary quintic), and their connecting syzygies. Many developments in pure mathematics can be traced back to his minor notes of the 1870 s and 1880 s, including the theory of knots, fractals, dynamic programming, and group theory (the well-known ley’s theorem). In graph theory, the number of dis-Caytinct labeled trees withn nodes being (nn)-2 is known as Cayley’s graph theorem.
He brought his theoretical knowledge of graphical trees to bear on the prob-lem of counting isomers in organic chemistry, thus prompting questions about the actual existence of cer-tain chemical compounds that have since been discovered in many instances by chemists. In the last decade of his life, Cayley set about the task that gave him an important line of contact with today’s mathematicians: the publication of his ical Papers in thirteen large volumes by Cambridge Collected Mathemat University Press.

Paris, 1901 Analysis (elliptic functions, differential equations); algebra (invariant theory, quadratic forms); approximation theory Like many who aspired to enter the École Poly tech-nique, Hermite under took special preparatory classes, in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He began to study serious mathematics, immersing himself in the work ofdre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution oflagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen equations by radicals.
Admitted to the École Polytechnique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed his first significant original work. This extended results of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very positively. This achievement both brought him recognition in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobi on elliptic functions and number theory that launched Hermite’s career.
commensurate with his abilities, and for almost a decade survived on teaching assistant and examiner Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms, where he followed ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study transformation.

Hermite’s dynas-tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law, Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-ried borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956).

In 1855, Kronecker’s former school teacher and closest scientific friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861, Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin University. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897)) highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about Kronecker.
After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kronecker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his teaching activities as well as the frequency of his publications. This last active period was cut short when hedied, shortly after the death of his wife.

and in 1880 he became the managing editor of thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange-Crelle’s Journal li shed, or in com pre he ns i ble proofs—). He was often criticized for incomplete, unpub-jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) spoke of his colleagues’ “envy and despair” with regard to his results. Only in his later years was he explicit about his constructivist methodology.
This constituted at least part of the quarrel with Weierstrass, and later prompted hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) to call Kronecker a “Verbotsdiktator” (“forbidding dictator”). Generally affable and hospitable, Kronecker was tough in defending his mathematical ideas and his claims to priority. (in the early 1850 s), he claimed not only the so-called In his first works on solvable algebraic equations Kronecker–Weber theorem (in today’s formulation:
every finite Galois extension of the rational num-bers with Abelian galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) lies in a field generated by roots of unity; the first correct proof of itwas given by Hilbert in 1896), but also a generalization to Abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields, which he later called his “liebster Jugendtraum” (“dear-est dream of his youth”).
This dream, which was incorrectly translated by Hilbert into his twelfth problem in1900, is today part of class field theory [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871) and the theory of complex multiplication. Such connections between algebra, analysis, and arithmetic continuedto pervade Kronecker’s later work.

For this, he propagated the introduction of indeterminates and equiv-alence relations, a method which he traced back to Gauss.
In the case of a finite extension of the rational numbers, for instance, Kronecker is explicitly working with polynomials modulo an irreducible equationf (x) = 0, rather than adjoining a root of it.

In 1857 he extended the theory of differential equations, specifically the impor-tant case of the hypergeometric equation, to complex functions. In 1859 he used deep, new ideas from complex function theory to study the (Riemann) zeta func-tion and proposed his celebrated conjecture, the riemann hypothesis of the complex zeros of this function.
The conjecture[IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), concerning the location remains unsolved to this day. These ideas enabled mathematicians to study complex functions on domains other than the plane and subsets of the plane. They opened the way to a geometric study of algebraic functions and algebraic curves, and proved to be decisive in the study of the integrals of algebraic functions (the theories of Abelian functions and theta functions of several variables). Investigations of the Riemann zeta function led not only to the discovery of new properties of classes of complex func-

Dirichlet had been able to prove that a real function was correctly represented by a Fourier series, but only under very restrictive conditions.
This left open the questions of what sorts of functions did not satisfy these conditions and how could they be studied. Riemann reformulated the concept of the integral and was able to show that it is not just the continuity of a function and the ways in which it may fail to be continuous that affect the accuracy of its Fourier series representation, but the nature of its oscillations.
The riemann integral remained the dominant definition of the integral until it was replaced by the lebesgue integral [III.55](/part-03/measures) after 1902, which is better adapted to capturing the way the behavior of a function affects its Fourier series. In a lecture, also given in 1854 (but published posthumously in 1868), he entirely reformulated geometry as being about spaces (sets of points, which he called manifolds(an appropriate concept of distance) and argued that[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)) with a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) the
geometric properties of a space were its intrinsic ones. He noted that there are three constant-curvature spaces in two dimensions and showed how the idea ofconstant curvature can be extended to higher dimensions. In passing, he was the first person to write down a metric for non-Euclidean geometry (more than a decade before Beltrami’s publication of 1868, which legitimized non-Euclidean geometry). This lecture earned him the right to teach in a German university.

But his vision described

Brunswick, Germany, 1916 Algebraic number theory; algebraic curves; set theory; foundations of mathematics Dedekind spent most of his life as a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Brunswick, Germany (his and gauss’s [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) home town), having spent the years 1858–62 at the Polytechnikum in Zürich (which later became known as ETH). He obtained his mathematical education at Göttingen, being Gauss’s last Ph. D. student and subsequently a pupil ofand riemann [VI.49].
Dedekind was a retiring man dirichlet [VI.36] with, ashe remained a bachelor, living with his mother and klein [VI.57] said, a “contemplative nature;” sister. Nevertheless, he had an impact upon a select group of contemporaries (especially frobenius [VI.58](/part-06/ferdinand-georg-frobenius-18491917), and Heinrich Weber) through his cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), rich correspondence.

Indeed, he shaped mod-[I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). His main contribution, however, was ern number theory as we know it, presenting it as a theory of ideals in rings of integers (see algebraic numbers [[IV.1 §§4–7]](/part-04/algebraic-numbers)).
This was first made public in 1871, within Supplement X to his edition of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, where he established unique decomposition of ideals into prime ideals for all rings of algebraic integers. In the process, he for-mulated the concepts of field, ring, ideal, and module (see [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and [III.81](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules)), always within the par-ticular context of the complex numbers. It was also in the context of algebra (Galois theory) and num-ber theory that Dedekind started systematic work with

(1879 and 1894) Dedekind went on refining his pre-In subsequent editions of Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen sentation of ideal theory, making it more purely set-theoretic. In 1882, together with Weber, he offered a theory of ideals in fields of algebraic functions, which made it possible to give a rigorous treatment of Riemann’s results on algebraic curves up to the roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). This work paved the way for riemann modern algebraic geometry.

In 1858 (published1872) he formulated a definition of the real numbers using what are now known as “Dedekind cuts” in the set of rational numbers. During the 1870 s (published1888) he elaborated a purely set-theoretic definition of the natural numbers as “simply infinite” sets, which led him to crystallize the dedekind–peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms).
In this work, as in his more advanced research, sets, structures, and mappings form the essential building blocks, the very foundations of pure mathematics. In the light of (now superseded) conceptions of logic, this led Dedekind to the view that “arithmetic (algebra, analysis) is only a part of logic.” From a modern viewpoint, his contributions show that set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) is a sufficient foundation for classical mathematics. Thus he contributed as much as any body else to the set-theoretic reformulation of modern mathematics.

These were the first groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups) (meaning that they did not fit into one sporadic simple of the known infinite families of simple groups) to be found. It is now known that there are twenty-six such groups altogether, although it was almost a century after Mathieu before a sixth one was found. VI.52 Camille Jordan b. Lyon, France, 1838; d.

Included in the calls linear substitutions (now written in matrix form Traité, in the chapter on what he as$y = Ax$), is the definition of what today is called the jordan normal form [III.43](/part - 03/jordan - normal - form) of a matrix, although in 1868 equivalent normal form.weierstrass [VI.44](/part - 06/karl - weierstrass - 18151897) had already defined an cially for the theorem now known as the theorem Jordan is also known for his work in topology, espe-.
This states that a simple closed curve in the Jordan curve plane separates the plane into two disjoint regions, an inside and an out side, and it was given by him in his influential Cours d’Analyse (1887). Although the theorem appears obvious, the proof, as Jordan recognized, is difficult and the one he gave was in correct. (The proof is relatively easy for smooth curves; the diff i cul-ties arise when dealing with no where-smooth curves, such as the Koch snowflake.) The first rigorous proof was given by Oswald Veblen in 1905.
There is a stronger form of the theorem, known as the Jordan–Schönfliestheorem, which states that in addition the two regions of the plane, the inside and the out side, are homeo-morphic to the standard circle in the plane. Unlike the original theorem, this stronger form of the theorem 777 cannot be generalized to higher dimensions, a famous counterexample being the Alexander horned sphere. VI.53 Sophus Lie b.

Later in life, looking back on his career, he said that it was the “audacity of his thinking” more than any formal knowledge and education that had given him a position among the fore most of mathematicians. During a career spanning more than thirty years, Lie produced almost eight thousand pages of mathematics, making him one of the most productive mathematicians of his time.

He studied the works of Poncelet (projective geom - etry) and Plücker (line geometry), and wrote a dissertation on “imaginary geometry,” that is, geometry based on complex numbers.
In the fall of 1869 he traveled to Berlin, Göttingen, and Paris, where he met mathe-maticians who would remain friends and colleagues for the rest of his life. In Berlin he met Göttingen he met Clebsch, and in Paris, where he was klein [VI.57], in joined by Klein, he met Darboux and These two had a particular influence on him—darboux jordan [VI.52](/part - 06/camille - jordan - 18381922).

Lie and Klein published three joint papers on geometrical topics, including one on the so-called Lie line–sphere transformation (the contact trans for - mation, which is a transformation that maps straight lines into spheres and principal tangent curves into curvature lines;
and then the study of the geometrical entities that are invariant under such transformations). “Erlanger Programm” (his character ization of geometryas properties invariant under a group action), Lie was When Klein prepared what was to become his famous with him. This work later created a deep rift between them. (Friendship turned into aloofness and hostility 778 and culminated in the following statement by Lie in1893:
“I am no pupil of Klein’s, nor is the reverse the case, although this would be nearer to the truth.”)Lie returned (after his first trip abroad) to Oslo and, in 1872, a chair of mathematics at the university was created especially for him. During the early1870 s Lie worked on turning his line–sphere transformation into a general theory of contact transforma - tions. From 1873 he worked on a systematic study of continuous transformation groups (today known as groups [III.48 §1](/part - 03/lie - theory)), his aim being to classify lie alge-lie brastion of differential equations.

The work that Engel and Lie started together resulted in three vol - umes, The orie der transformations gruppen (1888–93).
In 1886 Lie accepted the professorship in Leipzig (in succession to Klein, who had moved to Göttingen). In Leipzig he became a leading mathematician and a cen-tral figure in the European community of mathematicians. Promising new students from both France andthe United States were sent to study with him. Be sides teaching he continued his research on transformation groups and differential equations, and he solved the so-called Helmholtz space problem (characterizing the geometry of space in terms of groups of transformations).

Halle, Germany, 1918 Set theory; transfinite numbers; the continuum hypothesis Although born in Russia, Cantor was raised and educated in Prussia and spent his entire career as pro-fessor of mathematics at the University of Halle.
He studied at the Universities of Berlin and Göttingen with kronecker[VI.44](/part - 06/karl - weierstrass - 18151897), and received his Ph. D. from the University of[VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), kummer [VI.40], and weierstrass Berlin in 1867.

The following year he accepted lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813), gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), a position in the mathematics department at the University of Halle, where he spent the rest of his aca-demic career. There, his habilitationssc hrift was again devoted to number theory, and dealt with transformations of ternary quadratic forms.
was working on difficult problems involving trigono-metric series, and he interested Cantor in the problem It was at Halle that Cantor’s colleague, Eduard Heine, of determining the conditions under which a trigono-metric series of the form f (x) =1 2 a0 + n. nfty = 1(an . in nx + bn . os nx) uniquely represented a given function. In other words, could it be that two different trigonometric series could represent the same function?
Heine had shown, in 1870, that iff (x) is continuous in general (i.e., for all but a finite number of points of discontinuity, at which points Heine added that the function need not necessarily be finite), the representation is unique if we insist that the series is uniformly convergent toeral.
Cantor was able to establish much more generalf in gen- results, and in five papers written between 1870 and 1872 he was able to show that such representations were unique even if an infinite number of exceptional points were allowed, so long as these exceptional points (i.e., points at which the function failed to be continu-ous) were distributed over the domain of the function’s definition in a particular way, constituting what Cantor called “point sets of the first species.” His studies of these and related point sets eventually led Cantor to his much more abstract and powerful theory of
sets and transfinite numbers.

It was Cantor’s subsequent study(n + 1)st derived set was of infinite linear point sets that would eventually lead tohis creation of transfinite set theory in the 1880 s.
(For more details about this, see Before he did so, Cantor first began to explore theset theory [IV.22 §2](/part-04/set-theory).) implications of his work on trigonometric series andthe structure of the real numbers in several papers, one of which was to revolutionize mathematics in a fundamental way. The first of these papers was pub-lished in 1874, and bore the innocuous title “Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen” (“On a property of the collection of all real algebraic numbers”).
In this paper, Cantor proved that the set of all algebraic real numbers wasnite [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets). What was revolutionary about the paper, countably infihowever, was that he also proved that the set of all real numbers was not countable, and must be of a higher order of infinity than the countably infinite set of natural numbers. He returned to this result in 1891 witha new approach, the groundbreaking method of diagonalization, to prove in a very direct way that the set ofreal numbers is uncountably infinite.
Cantor’s second important paper of the decade appeared in 1878, “Ein Beitrag zur mannigfaltigkei tslehre” (“A contribution tothe theory of aggregates”), in which he proved (with a partly faulty argument) the invariance of dimension, a theorem first correctly proved by brouwer [VI.75](/part - 06/luitzen - egbertus - jan - brouwer - 18811966) in 1911. designed to out line the basic elements of his new think-ing about sets.
He first considered what happened if a Between 1879 and 1884 Cantor published six papers set were not of the first species by introducing sym-bols for the infinite indices needed to identify such sets. For example, a setond species if there was no finite P was said to be of then such that the nsec-th derived set Pn of Pwas finite. He then considered the case in which the intersection of all the derived sets of P (namely P^, P^ , . . . , Pn, . . .) was again an infinite set, which he designated had a derived set as well, P . nfty.
This set, since it was infinite,$P$. nfty$+1$, and this led in fact to an entire sequence of derived sets of the second species:$P \infty$, P$\infty$+1, . . . , P$\infty$+n, . . . , P2 . nf ty, . . . . In his first papers on infinite linear sets, these indices for derived sets remained “infinitary symbols”: that is, devices for distinguishing between different sets. But

779

in his le hre (“Foundations of a general set theory”), published Grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannigfaltigkei tsin 1883, these symbols became the first transfinite numbers: the transfinite ordinal numbers. These numbers began with re sent ing the sequence of natural numbers 1ω, the transfinite ordinal number rep-, 2, 3, . . . , which could also be thought of as the first infinite ordinal number after all of the finite whole numbers.
In the Grundlagen, Cantor not only devised the basic features of a transfinite arithmetic for these numbers, but he provided a detailed philosophical defense of the new numbers. Acknowledging the revolutionary nature of what he was introducing, he argued that the new concepts were necessary in order to achieve precise mathematical results that he could obtain by no other means. ever, the transfinite cardinal numbers, which he de-noted using the Hebrew letter aleph, were introduced Cantor’s best-known mathematical creation, how only later, in the 1890 s.
They were first given full expo-sition in a pair of papers (1895, 1897) that constituted his “Beiträge zur Begrundung der transfiniten Mengen-lehre” (“Contributions to the founding of transfinite set theory”). In two articles published in Mathematische annalen ordinal and cardinal numbers, as well as their arith-, he not only set out his theory of transfinite metics, but also explained his theory of order types, namely the different properties exhibited by the sets of natural, rational, and real numbers considered in their natural orders.
There he also stated (but could not prove) his famous continuum hypothesis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), namely that the power (or cardinal number) of the con-tinuum of all real numbers R is the next largest infinite set (or cardinal number) after the countably infi-nite set of natural numbers N, the cardinality of which was taken to be hypothesis algebraically as the statement that 2א0.

The most disturbing for many mathematicians were the“antinomies” of set theory: the paradoxes put forward by the likes of Burali-Forti andthe former published the paradox arising from the col-russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970).

Cantor himself was aware of the contradictions that arose from considering the col-lections of all transfinite ordinal or cardinal numbers, and what their ordinal or cardinal numbers might be. The solution Cantor adopted was to regard such collections as too large, and not really sets at all, but “in consistent aggregates” as he called them.
Others, like Zer-melo, began to axiomatize set theory in an effort to exclude the possibility of contradictions. The two most powerful results of the twentieth century to complement Cantor’s work are those of gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) (who established the consistency of the continuum hypoth-esis with zermelo–fraenkel set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory)) and Paul Cohen (who determined the independence ofthe continuum hypothesis from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), the latter finally establishing the impossibility of proving the continuum hypothesis.

also came second in the more demanding Smith’s prize examination. In 1868 he became a Fellow of Trinity, leaving in 1871 to become the professor of applied mathematics at University College London. He died of tuberculosis in 1879. A versatile mathematician, regarded by many as the best of his generation, Clifford’s favorite field was geometry, over which he ranged widely, proving new results in classical Euclidean geometry as well as in projective and differential geometry.
He was the first English mathematician to appreciate the work of riemann [VI.49] on differential geometry, and published a translation of Riemann’s paper “On the hypo the-ses that lie at the foundations of geometry” in 1873. He endorsed Riemann’s fundamental reformulation of geometry, and went even further in speculating that the curvature of physical space might explain the motion of matter.
He also made a significant application of thethe first to analyze the complicated topological nature riemann–roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), and was among of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) by showing how to dissect any Riemann surface into simple pieces in a stan-dard way. He was the first to study a geometry locally equivalent to plane geometry but topologically distinct(the flat torus, also known today as the Clifford–Klein space form after klein’s [VI.57] later more detailed study of it).
In algebra, he invented the biquaternions(these are like quaternions, but have complex numbers as coefficients). Clifford was regarded as a marvelous lecturer until his health broke, and he was a successful popularizer and essay writer. He forcefully adopted the view that geometry was a matter of experience, not a priori truth. He was a friend of T. H. Huxley and was sympathetic tohumanism in philosophy.

D. thesis Frege was trained at Jena and Göttingen, receiving addressed the spatial representation of imaginary ele-ments in geometry, and his 1874 Habilitation essay at Jena worked out some basic details of what we would now call “iteration theory.” Though his early work gave no obvious sign of the revolutionary work to come, with hindsight one can discern a foundational motif running through even the apparently conventional math-ematics of the early work:
a conviction that arithmetic was in some way or other logical, and that geometry was fundamentally different and less general because it was grounded in spatial intuition. This is an especially salient concern in some of his areas of early research, such as Plücker’s line geometry and riemann’s [VI.49] complex analysis, where the role of visual re pre sen-tation was a matter of some dispute. Frege sought to resolve the dispute by deriving arithmetic and analy-sis rigorously from logical principles. His motivation was not so much a desire for certainty:
rather, heheld that only “gap-free” proofs can reveal a science’s fundamental principles. Among the features of contemporary logic appearing first in Frege’s core logical writings ((1879) and Grundgesetze der Arithmetik Begriffsschrift(volume 1, 1893; volume 2, 1903)) are the following. (i) Inferences are analyzed within a quantified logic of propositions, which extends to relations as wellas to propositions of subject–predicate form. We would today describe Frege’s logical system as a higher-order predicate calculus.
(ii) Forms from syllogistic logic (such as “All As are Bs”) are interpreted as quantified conditionals (“For allx, if x is an A, then xis a B”), in the way that is now so standard as to seem inescapable, presenting implicitly the point that the underlying logical form of a proposition may differ from its surface grammar. (iii) The syntax of the language is explicitly displayed, and inferences are carried out strictly in accordance with the form of statements by explicitly stated rules. (iv) Rules of inference and axioms are distinguished;
the consequence relation and conditionals are distinguished. (v) “Function” is taken as an undefined primitive con-cept. (This was a contentious move. Some math-

v F(v) q (Here represents negation, v is the universal quantifier, and the long vertical line represents the conditional.) arithmetik on English-language philosophy since its translation Frege also wrote an in formal treatise,(1884), which has had a profound influence Grundlagen der in 1950. Its account of number contains the first hint ofthe tension that would collapse the project from within.
Frege sets out conditions that a definition of number must satisfy to be counted as “acceptable.” However, when formalized these lead to a contradiction, of a similar type to Russell’s paradox (on the set of all sets that are not members of themselves). This problem escaped Frege’s notice until Russell alerted him to it in a let-ter of 1903. Frege’s reaction (“arithmetic totters”) has been taken to be an over reaction to the failure of one set of axioms among many possible ones.
But in Frege’sview, the problem was not with the specific axioms, but rather that any logically adequate weakening appearedto violate some principle he took to be grounded in the nature of thought. Recently, many logicians who do not share Frege’s often baroque-seeming metaphysics of concepts have shown that some natural consistent weakenings of Frege’s system do support the derivation of the mathematics Frege aimed to reconstruct.

Göttingen, Germany, 1925 Higher geometry; function theory; theory of algebraic equations; pedagogy Klein had originally intended to be a physicist but during the course of his studies with Julius Plücker in Bonn, with whom he studied both mathematics and physics, he turned to mathematics, receiving his doctorate for a thesis on line geometry in 1868. After Plücker’s death in 1868 he went to Göttingen to study with Alfred Cleb-sch, where he worked exclusively on mathematics.
In 1869–70 he spent some months in Berlin studying with weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) and kummer [VI.40] before joining After passing his habilitation in Göttingen in 1871, lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) for a trip to Paris to see hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901). he took positions successively at Erlangen, Munich, and Leipzig, returning to Göttingen in 1886, where he remained until he retired (because of poor health) in1913.
In 1875 he married Anna Hegel, a granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. In 1872 Klein published his celebrated “Erlanger Programm,” a creative and unified conception of geom-etry. Building on a paper of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) of 1859 in which Cayley had shown how to deduce ean geometry [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from projective geometry euclid[I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), Klein applied his knowledge of group theory(learned from jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) in Paris) to create a hierarchy of
all geometries. He had recognized that each geometry could be characterized by a group of transformations and classified accordingly (seedamental mathematical definitions [I.3 §6.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)). The some fun-

More over, it was clear from his construction that a contradiction ineuclidean geometry [[II.2 §§6–10]](/part-02/geometry) would simultane-nonously involve a contradiction in Euclidean geometry. Klein regarded his work in function theory as his greatest achievement.
As his career progressed, he moved more and more from Plücker’s and Clebsch’s strictly geometric viewpoint toward the wider out-look embraced by riemann [VI.49], who had regarded analytic functions as given by conformal mappings between given domains. In his “Riemanns The orie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihrer Integrale” (1882), Klein gave a geometric treatment of function theory in which he fused Riemann’s ideas with the rigorous power-series methods of Weierstrass. Klein’s health broke down.
His attempt to keep upwith In 1882, when he was at the height of his powers, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in the race to develop the theory of automorphic functions (which are generalizations of periodic functions such as trigonometric functions, elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), etc.), during which he had proved his famous Grenzkreis (boundary circle) The-orem, had left him exhausted, and he was never again able to work with such intensity and at such a high level. After his breakdown Klein’s interest shifted progressively from research
toward pedagogy. In his efforts tomodernize mathematical education he developed outstanding organizational skills and initiated important and far-reaching editorial projects ranging from the preparation of lecture notes to coediting the twentyfour-volumes ch af ten (1896–1935). He was an editor of the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissen-Mathematische Annalen the founding members of the Deutsche Mathematik er-for almost fifty years, and was among Ver einigung (1890).
He also played an active role in establishing mathematical applications in science and engineering, as well as promoting the better under-standing of mathematics by engineers. results in the theory of algebraic equations (through Among Klein’s other achievements were important a consider at i on of the icosahedron he obtained a com-plete theory of the general fifth-degree equation (1884)) and in mechanics, in which, jointly with Arnold Som-merfeld, he developed the theory of the gyroscope (1897–1910).

(1910) and gravitation (1918). Klein was an interna-tional figure who traveled widely, including to the United States and the United Kingdom, and he played a significant role in the first International Congresses of Mathematicians. His many foreign students included several from the United States, e.g., Maxime Bôcher and William Fogg Osgood, and a number of women, notably Grace Chisholm Young and Mary Winston. Klein’s achievements made Göttingen the scientific center of Germany and one of the mathematical cen-ters of the world.
He possessed an outstanding ability to “see” the truth in mathematical statements and to bring mathematical fields together with out feeling the necessity for detailed calculations and justification (which he left to his students and others). He believed strongly in the unity of mathematics.

Frobenius) spent one semester studying mathematics and physics in Göttingen, then returned to Berlin where he studied under kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), kummer [VI.40], weierstrass sertation (in Latin) supervised by Weierstrass, in 1870,[VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), and others. He wrote his doctoral dison infinite series representations of analytic func-tions of one variable.
For four years he worked as a schoolteacher in Berlin before he became Außerordentlicher Professor (associate professor) at Berlin Uni-ver sity. After less than two years, in 1875, he was called to a full professorship at the Eidgenössische Technis-che Hochschule in Zürich, where he remained until

Later he wrote mainly on theta functions, algebra, and number theory. One of His early contributions were to analysis and the his well-known contributions lies across group theory and number theory. Given a polynomial with coefficients in an algebraic number field, one may ask forthe degrees of the irreducible factors that occur when it is reduced modulo a prime ideal.
In particular, onemay ask for the “density” (suitably defined) of the set of prime ideals modulo which a given pattern of irreducible-factor degrees arises. Pursuing ideas of Kro-necker, Frobenius proved that, if the galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) is the sity is the proportion of elements of the group whose symmetric group [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups), then that den cycle structure is the pattern of degrees. He conjectured that this should be true whatever the Galois group.
A tool he used for this led to the name “Frobenius automorphism” for the natural generator$a \to a^{q}$ of the Galois group of a finite extension of the field F . The conjecture was proved by N. G. Chebotaryov in 1925 and is now known as the Chebotaryov density theorem, or, some times, the Frobenius–Chebotaryov$q$ density theorem. Another well-known and important contribution was to the theory of matrices and linear transformations, where Frobenius introduced the minimal polynomial and other invariants (the elementary divisors). theory.
Like Otto Hölder andhe focused for a time on the search for Frobenius is best known for his work in finite group william burnside finite simple[VI.60](/part-06/william-burnside-18521927), groups invention of the theory of[V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups). His greatest contribution, however, is his group characters [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory). This emerged unexpectedly in 1896 out of his study of group determinants.
These are the determinants of square matrices with rows and columns indexed by the members of a finite group x - 1, where the xg are independent variables, one for G, and with (a, b)-entry each element respondence withab g of dedekind G. His interest, stimulated by cor-[VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916), was in how the group determinant factorizes as a polynomial in these variables.
This problem led Frobenius to the discoveryof certain sets of complex numbers, which he called gruppencharacte re the group, that arose as the solutions of sets of linear, one for each conjugacy class in equations connected with the group. Nowadays they are defined differently: for each complex linear repre-sentationρ of the group G (that is, homomorphism$784$ρinvertible matrices over: G \to GLn(C), where GLC), the associated charactern(C) is the group of n . imes  nχ is the mapg \in  G.
Frobenius proved the orthogonality relations, G \to  C such that χ(g) = trace ρ(g) for recognized the connection of his characters with matrix representations of the group, calculated the character tables of the symmetric groups, the alternating groups, and the Mathieu groups, and used properties of induced characters to prove his famous theorem that atransitive permutation group in which no element other than the identity fixes two or more points has a regu-lar normal subgroup (that is, a subgroup consisting of the identity together with the fixed-point-free elementsof the group).
To this day no purely group-theoretic proof of this theorem has been found. In recognition of his contribution such groups are now called Frobenius groups. Through character theory and representa-tion theory, as developed by Frobenius for finite groups (and by his pupil, friend, and colleague Issai Schur for classical matrix groups), group theory found important applications in physics and chemistry a generation later.

on PDEs, which excited particular attention, contained the result now known as the cauchy–kovalevskaya theorem [[IV.12 §§2.2, 2.4]](/part-04/partial-di-erential-equations), an important tool in establishing the existence of analytic solutions of PDEs. That same year Kovalevskaya returned to Russia and, unable to find a suitable position, temporarily aban-doned mathematics. In 1880, at the invitation of chebyshev [VI.45](/part-06/pafnuty-chebyshev-18211894), she gave a paper on Abelian integrals at a conference in Saint Petersburg.
It was enthusiasticall yreceived and in 1881 she returned to Berlin. She saw Weierstrass frequently and devoted herself to the study of the propagation of light in a crystalline medium— a subject to which she had been led by studying the work of the French physicist Gabriel Lamé—and to the study of the rotation of a solid body about a fixed point. Later that year she moved to Paris to work with mathematicians there. In 1883, championed by Mittag-Leffler, Kovalevskaya was appointed as a Privatdozent at the University of Stockholm.
She also became an editor of Acta mathematica of a scientific journal. On behalf of, making her the first woman to join the board Acta she liaised with mathematicians from Paris, Berlin, and Russia, providing an important link between Russian math-ematicians and their western European counterparts. She continued to work on the rotation problem andin 1885 made the breakthrough that, three years later, would win her the prestigious Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Sciences. Prior to her work the problem had been completely solved for only two cases, both symmetrical.

Kovalevskaya discovered that there was a third case, one that was a symmetrical and more complicated than the other two, which could also be solved completely.

From there he won a place at Cam-bridge, where he read for the Mathematical Tripos and graduated as 2 nd Wrangler in 1875.
For ten years he remained in Cambridge as a Fellow of Pembroke Col-lege, coaching student rowers and mathematicians. In 1885, having published three very short papers, he was appointed professor at the Royal Naval College, Green-wich. He married in 1886 and the next year, at the age of thirty-five, he embarked on his career as a productive mathematician. He was elected as a Fellow ofthe Royal Society in 1893 on the basis of his contributions in applied mathematics (statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics), geometry, and the theory of functions.
Although he continued to contribute to theseareas through out his working life, and added probability theory to his fields of interest during World War I, he turned to the theory of groups in 1893, and it is forhis discoveries in this subject that he is remembered. groups.
He was much concerned with the search for Burnside treated every aspect of the theory of finite finite simple groups, and made the famous conjecture, finally proved by Walter Feit and John Thompson in 1962, that there are no simple groups of odd composite order (see groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups)).
He helped to develop character theory, the classification of finite simple which had been created by frobenius [VI.58](/part - 06/ferdinand - georg - frobenius - 18491917) in 1896, into a tool for proving theorems of pure group theory, using it in 1904 to spectacular effect when he proved his so - called pαqβ-theorem: the theorem that groups whose orders are divisible by at most two different prime numbers are soluble.
By asking, in effect, whether a group all of whose elements have finite order and which is generated by finitely many elements must be finite, he launched the huge area of research which for much of the twentieth century was known as the Burnside problem (see group theory [IV.10 §5.1](/part - 04/geometric - and - combinatorial - group - theory)).geometric and combinatorial 785 man had written about groups before him, he was the Although cayley [VI.46](/part - 06/arthur - cayley - 18211895) and the Reverend T.

Soon after, he identified the related but more complicated Kleinian functions, which are auto-morphic functions with out a limit circle.

It led to his discovery of the disk model of the hyperbolic plane and later inspired the uniformization theorem [V.34](/part - 05/the-\text{uniformization} - theorem). During the same period Poincaré began pioneering work on the qualitative theory of differential equations, motivated in part by an interest in some of the fundamental questions of mechanics, notably the prob-lem of the stability of the solar system.
What was new and important was his idea of thinking of the solu-tions in terms of curves rather than functions, i.e., thinking geometrically rather than algebraically, and it was this that marked a departure from the workof his predecessors, whose research had been dominated by power-series methods.

The textbook he published in 1884, grale, partly based on lectures by his teacher Angelo Calcolo Differentiale e Principii di Calcolo Inte Genocchi, was noteworthy for its rigor and critical style, and is counted among the very best nineteenth-century treatises. The years 1889–1908 saw Peano dedicating himself intensively to symbolic logic, axiomatization, and pro-ducing the encyclopedic Formulaire de Mathématiques (1895–1908, five volumes). This ambitious assembly of 787 mathematical results, compactly presented in the sym-bols of mathematical logic, was given completely with out proofs.
This was by no means standard at the time, but it shows what Peano expected from logic: it was supposed to bring precision of language and brevity, but not a greater level of rigor (something that was, by contrast, crucial for with some colleagues, he founded the journal frege [VI.56](/part - 06/gottlob - frege - 18481925)).

He was a socialist in politics, and a tolerant universalist in all matters of life and culture. In the late 1890 s Peano became increasingly interested in elaborating auniversal spoken language, “Latino sine flexione”; the last edition of the language. Formulario (1905–8) appeared in this maticians such as Hermann Grassmann, Ernst Schrö-der, and Richard Dedekind;

It aimed at filling the most significant gap in the foun-da tions of mathematics at a time when the arithmetization is no coincidence that other mathematicians (Frege, of analysis had essentially been completed. It Charles S. Peirce, and Dedekind) published similar workin the same decade. Peano’s attempt is better rounded than Peirce’s, but simpler and framed in more familiar terms than those of Frege and Dedekind; because ofthis, it has been more popular.

He. . ..” Several themes wanted clarity, rigor, simplicity, and depth. Though he loved mathematics for its beauty, a beauty that transcends human failures, Hilbert saw mathematics as a social collaboration. A turning point came when he met minkowski [VI.64](/part - 06/hermann - minkowski - 18641909) and Adolf Hurwitz at university in Königsberg. Hilbert wrote:
“On unending walks we engrossed ourselves in the actual problems of the mathematics of the time; exchanged our newly acquired understandings, our thoughts and scientific plans; and formed a friendship for life.” Later Hilbert became professor at Göt-tingen and, with klein [VI.57], drew mathematicians from all over the world and turned that small city into acrossroads for mathematics—until Hitler destroyed it. would study mathematics as he taught, and he resolved When he was a new Privatdozent, Hilbert decided he never to repeat lectures.
He and Hurwitz decided to embark on a “systematic exploration” of mathematics, and he followed this pattern for the rest of his life. Hilbert’s career divides easily into six periods: (i) algebra and algebraic invariants (1885–93); (ii) algebraic number theory (1893–98); (iii) geometry (1898–1902);

(iv) analysis (1902–12); (v) mathematical physics (1910–22); and (vi) foundations (1918–30). Remarkably, there is very little overlap. When Hilbert finished a subject, he was finished with it. solved Gordan’s problem, named after Paul Gordan, ina single bold move. Given a polynomial equation with at Hilbert’s first breakthrough came in 1888 when he least two variables, some things about the polynomial change and some do not when you change coordinate systems. For example, consider the real polynomial equation ax2 + bxy + cy2 + d = 0.

If you rotate the coordinate system, then this equation changes dramatically, but the graph does not, and nei-ther does the discriminant$b^{2} - 4ac$. The discriminant is one invariant. In the general case—a more compli-cated class of polynomials and coordinate changes— there can be many invariants. Mathematicians sus-pected that a finite number of essentially different invariants existed for any given type of polynomial and class of coordinate changes. Was this so? Many mathematicians calculated individual examples industriously. Instead, Hilbert reasoned indirectly:
what if there is no finite basis for a specific class of polynomials and transformations? He found that it was always possible to produce a contradiction. He concluded that there must be such a basis. At first this result was greeted with disbelief because he did not display a basis. Gordan said, “Das ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist

Theologie.” However, the result was so powerful that ithas been said that it killed algebraic invariant theory. In 1893 Hilbert and Minkowski were asked by the German Mathematical Society to write a report on number theory. Hilbert chose algebraic number theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) and transformed the results of the nineteenth century into the study of algebraic number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields).
The deep organizing structure Hilbert found eventually led to what has been called “the magnificent edifice of class field theory” (described in [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871)). lished in 1899 and revised many times, starts with real-number arithmetic. He assumes that it is consistent, i.e., Hilbert’s classic Foundations of Geometry , first pub that it is free of the possibility of contradictory deduc-tions. Using analytic geometry, he then exhibits a model ofreal numbers;
a line is a set of pairs of numbers that euclidean geometry [II.2 §3](/part-02/geometry-origins). A point is a pair of satisfy the equation for a line; a circle. . .; and so on. All of Euclid’s axioms are true statements about these“lines” and “points,” that is, they are true statements about these sets of real numbers. Euclidean geometryis there by reduced to a fraction of all the true statements about real numbers, and we conclude that if real number arithmetic is consistent then Euclid’s geometryis consistent.
Next Hilbert constructs models of various non-Euclidean geometries in terms of euclidean geometry, exploring in depth and with great inventiveness which possible axioms follow from which groups of axioms and which are independent yet consistent. Hilbert was invited to address the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900.He gave a talk proposing twenty-three problems for the new century. These problems are known today as “Hilbert’s problems”;
in a sense they have created a vir-tual Göttingen where mathematicians have entered into conversation with Hilbert and each other ever since. Next Hilbert turned to analysis. weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) had found counterexamples to Dirichlet’s principle, which is essentially the assertion that, in variational problems, maxima and minima are always attained. Hilbert proved a modified, but still powerful, version that “salvaged” much of the work that assumed the principle.
The larger theme of this period, though, was integral equations and what is now called space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Newton’s equations for motion are dif-hilbert ferential equations, and it was natural to phrase equa-tions in physics that way. However, in many cases it was easier to solve problems if the equations were written using integrals rather than derivatives. Between1902 and 1912 Hilbert attacked a variety of problems

His second problem asked for a proof that first arithmetic, and then set theory, were consistent. As the debate widened, some mathematicians began to pull back on what they accepted as valid reason-ing. Hilbert wanted none of this. By 1918 he was increasingly focused on a program to formally axiom-atize mathematics and prove it free of contradictions using proof-theoretic, combinatorial methods.[VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness theorems in 1930 gödel and there by showed that Hilbert’s program, at least as initially conceived, could never be successful.
Hilbert was wrong here, but even if wrong, his dream of placing mathematics on a formal foundation stimulated some of the most important work of the twentieth century—and mathematics did not pull back.

Further results followed, including the famous “Hadamard gap theorem,” which gives the condition for the circle of convergence of the series to bea natural boundary of the function.
His monograph La Série de Taylor et son Prolongement analytique proved especially influential. In 1912 he formulated the(1901) problem of quasi-analyticity for infinitely differentiable functions. The year 1892 also saw the appearance of Hadamard’s prize-winning memoir on entire functions, in which he used results from his thesis to establish the relations between the coefficients of the Taylor series of an entire function and its zeros, and then applied themto evaluate the genus of the entire function.
He applied this work, and other results from his thesis, to the mann zeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), which enabled him, inrie1896, to prove his most famous result: the prime number theorem neo us ly by de la vallée poussin[V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860).

and fred his “three-circles theorem” (1896), which demonstrates the importance of convexity in the study of analytic functions and plays a significant role in interpolation theory. In 1896 Hadamard won the Prix Bordin for his study of the behavior of geodesics on surfaces. (The motiva-tion for studying such geodesics is that they can be used to represent the trajectories of motion in dynamical systems.) It was Hadamard’s first major work ona subject other than analysis.
His two papers, one on geodesics on a surface of positive curvature (1897) andthe other on geodesics on a surface of negative curvature (1898), are characterized by a qualitative analysis inherited from results from classical differential geometry, while thepoincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912).

In 1900 he began working on the theory of partial differential equations, and in 1903 published Leçons sur la Propagation des Ondes et les Équationsde l’Hydrodynamique; this was followed by Lectures on Cauchy’s Problem in Linear Partial Differential Equa-tions (1922). The latter contained the details of his fundamental idea of the well-posed problem [IV.12 §2.4](/part-04/analysis) (i.e., a problem in which the solution must not only exist and be unique but must also depend continuously on the initial data).

Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), 1868; d. Bonn, Germany, 1942 Set theory; topology Hausdorff studied mathematics at Leipzig, Freiburg, and Berlin between 1887 and 1891, and then started research in applied mathematics at Leipzig under Hein-rich Bruns. After his habilitation (1895) he taught first at Leipzig and then later at Bonn (1910–13, 1921–35)and Greifswald (1913–21).
He is best known for his work in set theory and general topology, his magnum opus being Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (“Basic features of set theory”). It was published in 1914 and VI.68. Felix Hausdorff had second and third editions in 1927 and 1935.The second edition was so heavily revised in content, however, that it should really be considered a new book. In his early work, Hausdorff concentrated on applied mathematics, mainly related to astronomy, in particu-lar the refraction and extinction of light in the atmosphere.
He had broad intellectual interests and moved in Nietzschean circles of artists and poets at Leipzig. Under the pseudonym Paul Mongré he wrote two long philosophical essays of which the more prominent was “Das Chaos in kosmischer Auslese” (“The chaos in cos-mic selection”). Until 1904 he regularly contributed cultural critical essays to a renowned German intellectual review of the time, continuing to contribute, although less frequently, until 1912. He also published poems and a satirical play.
tury and gave his first lecture course on the topic in Hausdorff took up set theory at the turn of the centhe summer semester of 1901 at Leipzig university. After his turn toward “Cantorianism” (set theory) he began deep and innovative research on order struc-tures and their classification. Among the results of his early work in set theory are the formula for exponentiation of cardinals and several Hausdorff recursion contributions to the study of order structures (cofi - nality, etc.).
Although Hausdorff did not pursue active research in the axiomatic foundation of set theory, he contributed important insights on transfinite numbers, in particular a character ization of what are now known as weakly inaccessible cardinals and his maximal chain principle predated the latter and differed from it in formulation, a form of zorn’s lemma [III.1](/part - 03/axiom - of - choice) that and intention. His own contribution to the axiomatic method was oriented toward generalizing classical areas of math-ematics and founding them on axiomatic principles within the framework of set theory.

Among his most important contributions in this Hausdorff’s central goals in using set theory were for respect, and of wide-ranging importance, was the concept of duced to give a notion of dimension to rather general hausdorff dimension [III.17](/part - 03/dimension), which he intro sets (such as, for example, fractal-type sets). theory were deeply connected to foundational ques - tions.

In the 1920 s Cartan broadened the setting to what are today called fiber bundles [IV.6 §5](/part - 04/algebraic - topology), and showed that Klein’s approach could be carried through by concentrating onthe possible types of coordinate transformation and the Lie groups to which they can belong. There are many problems in which one has a multitude of possible observations at each point of aspace: for example, the weather at each point of Earth’s VI. Mathematicians surface.
In Cartan’s formulation, Earth’s surface is taken as the base manifold [I.3 §6.9](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) and the possible observations at each point form another manifold, called the fiber at the point. The pair consisting of all fibers and all points of the base manifold is, roughly, a fiber bundle; the precise concept has proved to be fundamental across the whole field of modern differential geometry.
It was to prove a natural setting forthe study of what are called connections on a manifold, which deal with the way objects, such as vectors, are transformed as they move along curves in the manifold. Cartan’s fundamental idea was to capture the symme-try of a geometrical problem by allowing fibers to have a common symmetry group, although aspects of the geometry of the base manifold, such as its curvature, were allowed to vary from point to point in such a way that the base manifold admits no symmetries at all.
study of differential equations, which had earlier been amotivating concern for Cartan also applied his geometric approach to thelie [VI.53](/part - 06/sophus - lie - 18421899) in the creation of the theory of Lie algebras. He did important work on sys-tems of equations, and this led him to emphasize the role of what are called exterior forms. Familiar exam-ples include the 1 - form [III.16](/part - 03/dierential - forms - and - integration) that represents the element of length along a curve, the 2-form that represents the element of area of a surface, and so on.
The main thing one does to a 1-form is integrate it; integrating the 1-form that describes arc-length gives length along a curve. Cartan studied systems of equations involv-ing arbitrary 1-forms and was led to discover ways in which the algebra of 1 - forms, and more generally the algebra ofk-forms for arbitrary k, captures features of the geometry of the manifold on which they are defined. This led him to reformulate a method of studying the geometry of curves and surfaces that had been pursued by Gaston Darboux, the leading French geometer of the previous generation, and to proclaim his
method of “moving frames” that again related to the study of fiber bundles and symmetries in differential geometry. This work, together with his work on fiber bundles, remains a major source of ideas for the study of differentiable manifolds to this day. Further Reading Chern, S.-S., and C. Chevalley. 1984.

He assigned them “measure zero” and thus extended the domain of regularity of the functions considered.
Borel’s theory of measure, based on operations with infinitely many sets, became widely known through his influential des Fonctions (1898) and was later completed and Leçons sur la Théorie developed into a major tool of analysis by[VI.72](/part - 06/henri - lebesgue - 18751941).

philosophy of mathematics Russell’s training at Cambridge University in the early 1890 s inspired the part of his long and varied life that relates to mathematics. He divided his Tripos into Part 1 (Mathematics) and Part 2 (Philosophy), and then united these two trainings to seek a general philosophy of mathematics, especially its epistemological founda - tions, with geometry as the first test case (1897).
But over the next few years he changed his philosophical stance, especially when he recognized the significance ofalso discovered in 1900 a group of mathematicians cantor’s [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918) set theory from 1896 onward, and around peano [VI.62](/part - 06/giuseppe - peano - 18581932) in Turin. Wish ing to raise the level of axiomatization and rigor in mathematics, the fol-lowers of Peano formalized theories as much as possible, including the “mathematical logic” of propositions and predicates with set theory, but they kept mathematical and logical notions separate.
After learning their system and adding to it a logic of relations, Russell decided in 1901 that their distinction of notions was not necessary: all notions lay in that logic. This is the philosophical position that has become known 795 as “logicism,” and Russell wrote a largely nonsym-bolic account of it in The Principles of Mathematics (1903). In an appendix to this book he publicized the work of(but advocated it only for arithmetic and some analy - frege [VI.56](/part - 06/gottlob - frege - 18481925), who had anticipated logicism sis);

He was joined in the effort by his former Cambridge tutor, A. N. Whitehead; eventu-ally three volumes of Principia Mathematica appeared between 1910 and 1913.
After the basic logic andset theory, the arithmetic of real numbers and also the arithmetic of transfinite numbers were worked out in detail; a fourth volume on geometry was dueto be written by Whitehead, but he abandoned it around 1920.The paradoxes were solved by a “theory of types,” which formed a hierarchy of individuals, sets of individuals, sets of sets of individuals, and so on. A set or individual could only be a member of a set immediately above it in the hierarchy; thus, a set could not belongto itself. Comparable restrictions were laid on relations and predicates.
While this avoided the paradoxes, it also ruled out a great deal of good mathematics, since different kinds of numbers lay in different types and so could not be brought together for arithmetic opera - tions: for example, 34 + 7 was not even definable. The authors proposed the “axiom of reducibility” to allow18 such definitions to be made; but this was, frankly, justa fudge. form ofplicative axiom,” that he had found in 1904, just before Among the various features of Russell’s theory was athe axiom of choice [III.1](/part - 03/axiom - of - choice), called the “multi Ernst Zermelo.

As a teacher at longueure, aire” (1902). After university positions in Rennes, Poitiers, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, and following war-related research, Lebesgue became a pro-fessor at the Sorbonne (1919) and then, finally, at the Collège de France (1921).
One year later he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. Lebesgue’s most important achievement was his generalization of This was partly in response to the need to include riemann’s [VI.49] notion of an integral. broader classes of real-valued functions, and partly togive secure foundations to concepts such as the interchange ability of limit and integral in infinite series (par-ticular ly Fourier series). Alluding to a famous example (1881) by Vito Volterra of a bounded derivative that could not be integrated, Lebesgue wrote in his thesis:
The kind of integration defined by Riemann does not allow in all cases for the solution of the fundamental problem of the calculus: find a function with agiven derivative. It thus seems natural to search for a definition of the integral which makes integration the inverse operation of differentiation in as large a class of functions as possible. range of a function and summing up sets ofdinates (or arguments) belonging to given Lebesgue defined his integral by partitioning they - coordi - x - coor - nates (or ordinates), rather than, as had traditionally been done, partitioning the domain.
Lebesgue himself, according to his colleague, Paul Montel, compared his method with paying off a debt: I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the credit or in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken VI. Mathematicians out all my money I order the bills and coins accordingto identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after another to the credit or. This is my integral.
ter of Lebesgue’s integral, as compared with the more intuitive and natural summation used by Riemann. This The comparison reveals the more theoretical characmeant that more sophisticated functions, which were not necessarily integrable in Riemann’s sense, became “summable” according to Lebesgue. In order to perform his summations, Lebesgue had to base his new integral on Borel’s notion of[III.55](/part - 03/measures) (1898), which in turn drew heavily on cantor measure’s [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918) theory of infinite sets.
He used infinitely many intervals to cover and to measure sets, and was thus able to measure much less intuitive subsets of the linear continuum (the reals) than had hitherto been considered. A crucial role was played by the notion of“the set of measure zero” and the consider at i on of properties that were valid “except for” such sets, i.e., “almost every where.” This allowed for the theory to be streamlined to include fundamental results such as:
“A bounded function is Riemann integrable if and only if the set of its points of discontinuity has measure zero.” ing it a true generalization oflier theory. From Jordan he also borrowed the impor-Lebesgue completed Borel’s theory of measure, mak - jordan’s [VI.52](/part - 06/camille - jordan - 18381922) eartant notion of a function of bounded variation for his theory of the integral. Lebesgue ascribed a measure to any subset of a “set of measure zero,” and opened up broader theoretical questions such as whether there exist any sets that are not Lebesgue - measurable.
The latter question was proved in the affirmative by the Italian Giuseppe Vitali in 1905 with the help of theof choice [III.1](/part - 03/axiom - of - choice), while Robert Solovay showed in 1970, axiom with methods of mathematical logic, that with out the axiom of choice such existence cannot be proved (seeset theory [IV.22 §5.2](/part - 04/set - theory)). Lebesgue himself remained skeptical about an unlimited use of set-theoretical principles such as the axiom of choice.
He held a rest ric-tive view of the “existence” of mathematical objects by making “definability” the touchstone for his empiricist philosophy of mathematics. leled, although not in such depth, in the work ofthe English mathematician W.

Hardy was the most influential mathematician in Britain in the twentieth century. With the exception ofthe years from 1919 to 1931, when he was the Savilian professor of geometry in Oxford, he spent his adult life in Cambridge, where from 1931 until his retirement in 1942 he was the Sadleirian professor of pure math - ematics.

Later, with Littlewood, he proved$σ =1 2 (see$ deep extensions of this result. From 1914 to 1919 he collaborated with the largely self-taught Indian genius,[VI.82](/part-06/srinivasa-ramanujan-18871920).
