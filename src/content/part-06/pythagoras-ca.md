d. Metapontum, Magna Graecia (now Metaponto, Italy)?, ca. 494 b.c.e.
Incommensurability; theorem of Pythagoras
One of the most elusive figures of antiquity, Pythago-
ras is famous not just for his alleged mathematical
achievements: it has been claimed that he had a golden
thigh and that he issued a prescription against broad
beans. Few things about him can be taken as his tori-
cal facts, but we can be reasonably confident that he
lived in around the sixth century b.c.e. in Greek south-
ern Italy and that he established a group of follow-
ers, the Pythagoreans, who shared not just beliefs, but
also dietary habits and a code of behavior. The exis-
tence of anecdotes about splinter Pythagoreans who
revealed secrets to outsiders and were accordingly pun-
ished suggests that they were far from constituting a
completely homogeneous group.
   After a peak period in the late fifth century b.c.e., the
Pythagoreans dispersed, probably as a result of their
involvement in the public life of various city-states.
The impact of their theories about the universe and
the soul was very long-lived, though, and can be felt in
Plato, Aristotle, and later authors. From the third cen-
tury b.c.e. until well into late antiquity, a stream of texts
was produced that purported to be by Pythagoras or
his immediate successors. Indeed, historians talk of a
neo-Pythagorean philosophical movement, some times
associated with neo-Platonism.
   The name of Pythagoras and his school is most
commonly linked to the theorem establishing that the
square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle
is equivalent to the sum of the squares on the other
two sides. In fact, there is some evidence that the
mathematical property expressed by the theorem was
known in Mesopotamia long before Pythagoras’s time;
the ancient sources attributing the result to him are
late and not entirely reliable, and no actual proof of

Mathematicians
the theorem is found before Euclid’s Elements. While
the proof itself may predate euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca), there is no
solid reason to connect it to Pythagoras.
Similarly, the discovery of the incommensurabil-
ity of the side and the diagonal of a square, often
attributed to Pythagoreans, may have been made earlier
in Mesopotamia, and the earliest full proof in a Greek
context belongs to a later period.
Pythagoras’s real contribution to mathematics lies
elsewhere. The Pythagoreans are credited by Aristo-
tle with the theory that “things themselves are num-
bers.” One interpretation is that they believed that
mathematics offered a key to understanding reality,
whether this reality was conceived to have an under-
lying geometrical structure (as in Plato’s Timaeus), or
whether it was simply seen as ordered and “in propor-
tion.” Indeed, Pythagoreans are plausibly credited with
a strong interest in formulating the numerical ratios
of musical concords and harmony. They connected the
harmonious sound produced by, say, the plucking of
a string with the fact that the musician plucked it at
specific, mathematically expressible points. Breaking
the mathematical proportion between the points on
the string unsettled the sound produced. The heavenly
bodies themselves, according to the Pythagoreans, pro-
duced music, thanks to their mathematical, and there-
fore orderly, arrangement. Understand the mathemat-
ics, and you will grasp the structure of reality: this
insight is perhaps Pythagoras’s true legacy.
