VI.71.   Bertrand Arthur William Russell

b. Saint-Affrique, France, 1871; d. Paris, 1956
Professor of Mathematics: University of Lille (1893–96),
École Normale, Paris (1896–1909); Chair of Theory of Functions
(specially created for him), Sorbonne, Paris (1909–41);
first direct or of the Institut Poincaré (1926)
Borel’s thesis of 1894 started with problems from
within the classical theory of complex functions. With
a new theory of measure [III.55](/part-03/measures) based on cantor’s
[VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) set theory and, in particular, a “covering the-
orem” (later misnamed the Heine–Borel theorem), he
gave a rationale for neglecting certain infinite sets of
singularities. He assigned them “measure zero” and
thus extended the domain of regularity of the func-
tions considered. Borel’s theory of measure, based on
operations with infinitely many sets, became widely
known through his influential Leçons sur la Théorie
des Fonctions (1898) and was later completed and
developed into a major tool of analysis by lebesgue
[VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941). It was, in addition, an important prerequisite
for the axiomatization of probability by kolmogorov
[VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987).

Mathematical logic and set theory; philosophy of mathematics
Russell’s training at Cambridge University in the early
1890 s inspired the part of his long and varied life
that relates to mathematics. He divided his Tripos into
Part 1 (Mathematics) and Part 2 (Philosophy), and then
united these two trainings to seek a general philosophy
of mathematics, especially its epistemological founda-
tions, with geometry as the first test case (1897). But
over the next few years he changed his philosophical
stance, especially when he recognized the significance
of cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) set theory from 1896 onward, and
also discovered in 1900 a group of mathematicians
around peano [VI.62](/part-06/giuseppe-peano-18581932) in Turin. Wish ing to raise the level
of axiomatization and rigor in mathematics, the fol-
lowers of Peano formalized theories as much as possi-
ble, including the “mathematical logic” of propositions
and predicates with set theory, but they kept math-
ematical and logical notions separate. After learning
their system and adding to it a logic of relations, Rus-
sell decided in 1901 that their distinction of notions
was not necessary: all notions lay in that logic. This
is the philosophical position that has become known

as “logicism,” and Russell wrote a largely nonsym-
Emile Borel
(1903). In an appendix to this book he publicized the
work of frege [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925), who had anticipated logicism
(but advocated it only for arithmetic and some analy-
sis); Russell read him in detail after forming his own
position, which continued to be influenced more by
Peano.
Now the job was to expound logicism in Peanesque
detail—a daunting task, made even harder by Rus-
sell’s discovery in 1901 that set theory was suscep-
tible to paradoxes, which would have to be avoided
or even solved. He was joined in the effort by his
former Cambridge tutor, A. N. Whitehead; eventu-
ally three volumes of Principia Mathematica appeared
between 1910 and 1913. After the basic logic and
set theory, the arithmetic of real numbers and also
the arithmetic of transfinite numbers were worked
out in detail; a fourth volume on geometry was due
to be written by Whitehead, but he abandoned it
around 1920.
The paradoxes were solved by a “theory of types,”
which formed a hierarchy of individuals, sets of indi-
vi duals, sets of sets of individuals, and so on. A set or
individual could only be a member of a set immediately

to itself. Comparable restrictions were laid on relations
and predicates. While this avoided the paradoxes, it
also ruled out a great deal of good mathematics, since
different kinds of numbers lay in different types and
so could not be brought together for arithmetic opera-
tions: for example, 34 + 187
was not even definable. The
authors proposed the “axiom of reducibility” to allow
such definitions to be made; but this was, frankly, just
a fudge.
Among the various features of Russell’s theory was a
form of the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice), called the “multi-
plicative axiom,” that he had found in 1904, just before
Ernst Zermelo. It had a curious role within logicism,
partly because its logicist status was suspect.
While there was discussion of Principia Mathemat-
ica, concerning both its logic and its logicism, it tended
to be too mathematical for the philosophers and too
philosophical for the mathematicians. However, the
program influenced some kinds of philosophy, includ-
ing Russell’s own; and as an example of high-level
axiomatization it served as a model for foundational
studies, including gödel’s incompleteness theorems
[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem) of 1931, which showed that logicism as Russell
had conceived it could not be achieved.
