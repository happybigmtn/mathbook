Logic; relativity theory
Born in Brno, Moravia, Gödel did his most important
work at the University of Vienna. In 1940 he emigrated
to the United States, where he accepted an appointment
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
  Considered the greatest mathematical logician of the
twentieth century, Gödel is renowned for his proofs of
three fundamental results: the semantic completeness
of first-order logic [IV.23 §2](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory); the syntactic incom-
pleteness of formal number theory [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem); and
the consistency, relative to the axioms of zermelo–
fraenkel [IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) set theory, of the axiom of
choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) and the generalized continuum hypoth-
esis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory).
  Gödel’s completeness theorem (1930) is concerned
with the following kind of question: how do we know
that a statement in group theory, for example, that is
true in every group is actually provable from the axioms
of group theory? Gödel showed that in any first-order
theory (one in which quantifiers are allowed over ele-
ments but not over subsets), any statement true in all
models is indeed provable. In an equivalent form, this
completeness theorem states that any set of statements
that is consistent (that is, from which no contradiction
may be derived) has a model—a structure in which all
those statements hold.
  Gödel’s incompleteness theorem (1931) sent shock
waves through logic and the philosophy of mathemat-
ics. hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) had set out a program in which all
statements (in number theory, for example) should be
derivable from a fixed set of axioms. It was generally
believed that such a program was in principle possible,
until the incompleteness theorem destroyed that hope.
  Gödel’s idea was to construct a statement S that, in
effect, asserts “S is not provable.” A moment’s thought
shows that such a statement must be both true and
unprovable. Gödel’s remarkable achievement was to
manage to encode such a statement in the language
of number theory. His proof applies to such axioms as
the peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms) for number theory, and more

generally, to any reasonable extension of them (such as
the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory).
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem represented
another blow to the Hilbert program. Suppose that
Wolfgang Coy   we have a set of axioms T (for example, the Peano
axioms) that is consistent. Can we prove that it is con-
sistent? Gödel showed that, if T is consistent, then
Kurt Gödel
the statement “T is consistent” (when encoded as a
statement of number theory) cannot be proved from T .
So “T is consistent” is an explicit example of a true
but unprovable statement. Again, this applies when T
is the set of Peano axioms, or any reasonable exten-
sion there of (roughly, any extension that allows one
to encode into arithmetic statements about pro vab il-
ity and the like). As a slogan: “a theory cannot prove its
own consistency.”
The axiom of choice became highly controversial
when Ernst Zermelo used it to prove that every set can
be well-ordered, a task that, together with the proof
of the continuum hypothesis, Hilbert had listed first
among the problems he posed in 1900 to the Inter-
national Congress of Mathematicians. In 1938 Gödel
showed that both the axiom of choice and the gen-
eralized continuum hypothesis are consequences of
another principle (the axiom of construct i bility) that
holds in a submodel of any model of Zermelo–Fraenkel
set theory. Both are consequently consistent with (not
disprovable from) the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Much
later (1963) Paul Cohen showed that both statements
are also independent of (not provable from) those
axioms.
Apart from logic, Gödel also worked in relativity
theory, where he established the existence of models
of einstein’s field equations [IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations) that permit time
travel into the past.

Algebraic geometry; number theory
André Weil was one of the most influential mathemat i-
cians of the twentieth century. His influence is due
both to his original contributions to a remarkably broad
spectrum of mathematical theories, and to the mark

he left on mathematical practice and style, through
some of his own works as well as through the bour-
baki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) group, of which he was one of the principal     in Rouen, was very modest, and contained little more

   Weil, as well as his sister, the philosopher, political   years of searching in various directions while in resi-

excellent education. Both were brilliant students, very
widely read, with a keen interest in languages (including    sis for all nonsingular curves. This proof relied on his
Sanskrit). André Weil soon specialized in mathematics,
his sister in philosophy. He graduated (and was first in
his year in the agrégation for mathematics) from the
École Normale Supérieure (ENS) when he was not even
nineteen years old, and traveled in Italy and Germany.
He obtained his doctorate in Paris at the age of twenty-     trary dimensions, defined over a finite field, and added
two, and then went to Aligarh, India, as a professor
for two years. After a brief spell in Marseilles, he was     of the relevant zeta functions. Taken together, all these

included other friends from the ENS.
   His research achievements began with his 1928 Paris
thesis. In it, he generalized mordell’s theorem [V.29](/part-05/rational-points-on-curves-and-vi40-ernst-eduard-kummer-18101893)
of 1922, that the group of rational points on an ellip-
tic curve [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) is a finitely generated Abelian group,     tip li city), owes its basic notions (generic points, spe-
to the group of K-rational points (where K is a number
field [III.63](/part-03/number-fields)) of a Jacobi an variety. During the follow-     influence on the mathematical community in conju nc-
ing twelve years, Weil branched out in various direc-
tions, all related to important research topics of the
1930 s: the approximation of holomorphic functions
of several variables by polynomials; the conjugation
of maximal tori in compact lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory); the
theory of integration on compact and Abelian topolog-
ical groups; and the definition of uniform topologi-
cal spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces). But problems of arithmetic origin
stood out among his interests: further thoughts on his
thesis and on Siegel’s finiteness theorem for integral
points; a bold “vector bundle” version of the riemann–
roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) on a Riemann surface (in parallel
with similar work by E. Witt); p-adic analogs of elliptic    curves over the rational numbers should be modular—
functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) (with his student Elisabeth Lutz).
   Starting in 1940, Weil became active on what was
probably the biggest challenge in arithmetic algebraic
geometry at the time. Helmut Hasse had proved in 1932
the analogue of the riemann hypothesis [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory) for
curves of genus 1 (elliptic curves) defined over a field
with finitely many elements. The problem was to gen-
eralize this to algebraic curves of genus higher than 1.     for Advanced Study.

[V.35](/part-05/the-weil-conjectures); they represented the most important stimulus

and 1940 s trying to rewrite algebraic geometry. Weil’s

insights (e.g., a novel definition of intersection mul-
cializations) to van der Waerden, and it exerted its
tion with the (different) rewriting of algebraic geometry
developed so successfully by Oscar Zariski from 1938
onward. It was therefore to a large extent the charac-
teristic style, rather than just the “mathematical con-
tent,” of the Foundations that would create a new way
of doing algebraic geometry for the next twenty years
or so, until it began to be replaced by Grothendieck’s
language of schemes.
Later works include, among other seminal papers
and books, Weil’s “adelic” rewriting of Siegel’s work
on quadratic forms, and a crucial contribution to the
philosophy, due to Taniyama and Shimura, that elliptic
the proof of this fact is the basis of Wiles’s 1995 proof
of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem).
In 1947, Weil—whose evasion of the French draft in
1939 was considered very critically by many American
colleagues—finally obtained a professorship at a distin-
guished university, namely Chicago. In 1958, he moved
to Princeton as a permanent member of the Institute

many fronts of mathematical research, contributing
