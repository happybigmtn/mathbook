geometry, given a line in a plane and a point not on
the line there are two lines through the point that are
asymptotic to the given line (one in each direction);
these two lines separate the lines through the point
which meet the given line from those that do not. Loba-
che vskii called these the parallels to the given line
through the given point. Starting from this definition,
he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles,
and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-
iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the
triangles are very small. He extended his results to
describe a geometry of three dimensions, thus mak-
ing it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-
etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to mea-
sure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether
his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account
of space than Euclidean geometry.
   He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in
Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they
drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-
grad ski i, a much better known mathematician in Saint
Petersburg. He published in French in a German jour-
nal in 1837, in German in a book let of 1840, and again
in French in 1855, but to little avail. gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855)
appreciated the book let of 1840 and in 1842 had Loba-
che vskii made a corresponding member of the Göttin-
gen Academy of Sciences, but this was to be the only
acclaim Lobachevskii received in his lifetime.
   Lobachevskii’s final years were marked by terrible
financial and mental decline. Such was the chaos of his
household that Lobachevskii’s biographers have been
unable to establish the number of children born into it,
but it may well have been fifteen or even eighteen.

Green, a self-taught mathematician, went to Cambridge
University at the age of forty, having already produced

his most important work, the privately printed An Essay
on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the The-
ories of Electricity and Magnetism (1828). In this work,
which Green opened by stressing the central role of the
“potential function” (a term that he himself coined), he
proved the three-dimensional version of the theorem
now named after him, and introduced the concept that
riemann [VI.49] later called Green’s function (1860).
The Essay became widely known only after its discovery
in 1845 by William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who
was responsible for its republication in the Journal für
die reine und angewandte Mathematik (1850–54).
Green gave his version of the theorem (in modern
notation) as
∂V
UΔV dv +          U dσ =     V ΔU dv + V        dσ ,
dn
where U and V are two continuous functions of x, y, z
whose derivatives are not infinite at any point of an
arbitrary body, n is the surface normal of the body
directed inward, and dσ is a surface element. The result
today known as Green’s theorem, which is the planar
version of the above, was first published by cauchy
[VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) in 1846, and it can be given (in modern nota-
tion) as follows. Let R be a closed plane region with
a piecewise-smooth boundary curve C with positive
orientation. Let P (x, y) and Q(x, y), having continu-
ous partial derivatives, be defined on an open region
containing R. We then have
∂Q   ∂P
(P dx + Q dy) =
C                          R    ∂x   ∂y
More original than his theorem, however, was the
powerful technique Green developed to solve certain
second-order differential equations. In essence, Green
sought a “potential function” and formulated the con-
ditions it needed to satisfy. His great insight was to
recognize that the central issue in potential theory was
to relate properties inside volumes to properties on
their surfaces. Green’s functions are extensively used
today in the solution of inhomogeneous differential

Abel’s life was short and penurious, but successful, and
he received recognition in his lifetime. His father—a
minister of the church in Norway, but also at one time
a government minister—over reached himself and when

he died he left the family in straitened circumstances. Abel’s exceptional intellectual talents were recognized at school, and funds were raised to enable him to complete his education and, in particular, to study mathematics. At age twenty-two, he was awarded a scholarship to make a two-year tour of Europe, during which he studied in Berlin and Paris. In Berlin he met and was befriended by Auguste Crelle, the engineer who had just founded the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Crelle’s Journal).
Almost all of Abel’s mathematical work was published in the first four volumes of the journal. From 1826 until his death in 1829 Abel eked out a poor existence, earning a little by teaching, but using what few resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother. He died of consumption at the age of twenty-seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin. Abel’s main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas. The first of these was the theory of equations.
Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) in 1770 and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) in 1815 about the form of functions of the roots of an equation, and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted. Lagrange had hinted at the possibility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between 1799$and$1814 trying to prove this, though he had not managed to persuade his contemporaries.
Abel’s first success was to give an acceptable proof of the fact that, for polynomial equations of degree $5$ , there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution. This first appeared in 1824 in a short pamphlet written in French and published privately in Christiania (Oslo). Once Abel reached Berlin, however, Crelle translated it into German and published it in the first volume of his journal;
he also published a fuller, more detailed account, covering polynomials of any degree greater than $4$ , in 1826 . Abel returned to equations a few years later, publishing a long paper in 1829 about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions. His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as a function of every other root, the second that these functions commute (in modern terms, the galois group [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) of the equation is commutative). He proved various theorems about such equations, the most striking

$761$

being that they are soluble by radicals. This represented an extensive generalization of the ideas described by gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) in the seventh part of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, where the special case of cyclotomic equations (which satisfy both of these conditions) is treated systematically. It was in honour of this work that, later, the adjective “Abelian” was applied to groups that are commutative.
It is important to appreciate, however, that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations with out any appeal to groups, which at that time were not yet known. He also made major contributions to the theory of convergence. Although there had been over a century of critical thinking devoted to foundations of the calculus, modern ideas of rigour were only just emerging in the writings of bolzano [VI.28](/part-06/bernard-bolzano-17811848), Cauchy, and others.
Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy’s lectures of $1820 - 21$ , but series in general, and power series in particular, were still far from well understood. Among other contributions, Abel offered a proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers, and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel’s limit theorem. Perhaps his greatest discoveries, however, were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together.
To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words: first, a new and productive approach to the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem); and, second, a vast generalization of elliptic functions to what are now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals. In this area Abel competed for priority with jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). Most (though by no means all) of his work was written in two memoirs.
One was published in two parts, “Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques” and “Précis d’une théorie des fonctions elliptiques,” coming to well over two hundred pages in Crelle’s Journal in 1828$and$1829 . The other, entitled “Mémoire sur une propriété générale d’une classe très étendue de fonctions transcendantes,” was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October 1826 . There it lay on Cauchy’s desk, unread until after Abel’s death. It was published by the Paris Academy in 1841 . The manuscript itself, however, was stolen by G.
Libri, lost, and rediscovered in parts between 1952$and$2000 by Viggo Brun and Andrea del Centina. In June 1830 the Paris Academy awarded its Grand Prix de Mathématiques jointly to Abel (posthumously) and Jacobi for their work on elliptic functions.
