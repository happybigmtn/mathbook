Like many who aspired to enter the École Poly tech-
nique, Hermite under took special preparatory classes,
in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand.
He began to study serious mathematics, immersing
himself in the work of lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen-
dre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution of
equations by radicals. Admitted to the École Poly tech-
nique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed
his first significant original work. This extended results
of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions
[V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very
positively. This achievement both brought him recogni-
tion in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobi
on elliptic functions and number theory that launched
Hermite’s career.
   Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position
commensurate with his abilities, and for almost a
decade survived on teaching assistant and examiner
jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number
theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms,
where he followed gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study-
ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear
transformation. It was in this context that the hermi-
tian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) named after him arose. Her-
mite was interested in invariants of quadratic forms,
and also applied his work to the problem of location
of roots of polynomials. As a result of these efforts,
in 1856 he was appointed to the Paris Academy of Sci-
ences, with liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) sup-
port ing him. This appointment was quickly followed
by Hermite’s 1858 discovery of a means to express the
solutions of the general fifth-degree polynomial equa-
tion in terms of elliptic functions, which earned him
widespread international recognition.
   Finally obtaining a professorship at the Faculty of Sci-
ence in Paris in 1869, Hermite became an influential
mentor for a generation of mathematicians, his best-
known protégés including J. Tannery, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912),

E. Picard, P. Appell, and E. Goursat. Hermite’s dynas-
tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law,
Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris
Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell
married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-

the transcendence [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) of “e” using continued-
approximation theory (which had included the inven-
tion of the Hermite polynomials). His influence in the
mathematical community was strong until his death.

b. Liegnitz, Silesia, today Poland, 1823; d. Berlin, 1891
Algebra; number theory
One of the dominant mathematicians of the second
half of the nineteenth century, Kronecker is best known
today for his constructivist views and his contributions
to number theory. After finishing his Ph. D. under the
supervision of dirichlet [VI.36] in 1845, Kronecker
left Berlin and mathematics in order to manage a fam-
ily estate and to wind up his father-in-law’s banking
business. These activities left him wealthy and free
to return to Berlin and concentrate on mathematics
with out holding an academic position. In 1855, Kro-
necker’s former school teacher and closest scientific
friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to
Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861,
Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of
Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin Univer-
sity. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-
leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897))
highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and
Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to
bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about
Kronecker. After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kro-
necker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his
teaching activities as well as the frequency of his pub-
lications. This last active period was cut short when he
died, shortly after the death of his wife.
