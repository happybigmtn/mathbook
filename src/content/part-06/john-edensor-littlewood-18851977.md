that any one-to-one area-preserving transformation of
an annulus that moves the boundary circles in oppo-
site directions must have at least two fixed points, and
its importance lies in the fact that its proof implies
the existence of periodic orbits in the restricted three-     fascinated by the problem of analyzing the fund a men-
body problem.) He introduced several new concepts
into dynamical theory, including “recurrent motion”
(1912) and “metric transitivity” (1928), and promoted
the use of symbolism in dynamics (1935), the latter
helping to pave the way for the formalized develop-
ment of symbolic dynamics (the branch of dynami-
cal systems invented by hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) (1898) that
deals with spaces consisting of infinite sequences of
symbols) by Marston Morse and Gustav Hedlund at the
end of the 1930 s. His book Dynamical Systems (1927)
was the first book on the qualitative theory of systems
defined by differential equations. Awash with topolog-
ical ideas, it provides a connected account of much of
his earlier research.
   Closely related to Birkhoff’s dynamical research was
his work on ergodic theory [V.9](/part-05/ergodic-theorems). Stimulated by the
theorems of Bernard Koopman and von neumann
[VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957), Birkhoff presented his own ergodic theorem in
1931, a fundamental result both for statistical mechan-
ics and for measure theory [III.55](/part-03/measures), the proof of which
combined Poincaré’s topological approach with the
use of Lebesgue measure theory. (Roughly speaking,
Birkhoff’s ergodic theorem states that for any dynam-
ical system given by differential equations that pos-
sesses an invariant volume integral, there is a defi-
nite “time probability” p that any moving point, except
those of a set of measure zero, will be in an assigned
region v. In other words, if t is a total elapsed time
interval and t∗ is the portion of time during which the
point is in v, then lim t ∗ /t = p.)
   In the creation of physical theories Birkhoff advo-
cated mathematical symmetry and simplicity above
physical intuition. His books on relativity theory (which     converse of abel’s [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) classical theorem that if a
were among the first on the subject in English), Relativ-
ity and Modern Physics (1923) and The Origin, Nature,
and Influence of Relativity (1925), were characteristi-
cally original and widely read. At the time of his death
he was engaged in developing a new theory of matter
(taken to be a perfect fluid), electricity, and gravitation,   extended area of analysis called Tauberian theorems.
which he had first proposed in 1943 and which, unlike
Einstein’s theory, was based on flat spacetime.
   Birkhoff published in several other fields, including
the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods) and map color-
ing, and he was the coauthor (with Ralph Beatley) of
a textbook of elementary geometry (1929). His paper

(with O. D. Kellogg) on fixed points in function space
(1922) provided a stimulus for the later work of Leray
and Schauder.
Birkhoff had a lifelong interest in the arts and was
tals of musical and artistic form. In later life he lectured
extensively on the application of mathematics to aes-
thetics, and his book Aesthetic Measure (1933) enjoyed
popular success.

Analysis; number theory; differential equations
Littlewood made important contributions to several
different branches of analysis and analytic number
theory, including Abelian and Tauberian theory, the
riemann zeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), waring’s problem,
goldbach’s conjecture [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859), harmonic analysis,
probabilistic analysis, and nonlinear differential equa-
tions. He loved concrete problems such as the riemann
hypothesis [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory): he was arguably the best problem
solver of his generation. Much of his work was done in
collaboration with hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947): the Hardy–Littlewood
partnership dominated the mathematical scene in the
United Kingdom for a third of a century. With the excep-
tion of three years in Manchester, he lived all his adult
life in Trinity College, Cambridge. From 1928 until his
retirement in 1950, he was the first holder of the Rouse
Ball Chair of Mathematics in Cambridge.
His first major result, published in 1911, was a deep
                     
series of reals an sums to A, then an x n also tends
to A as x → 1 from below. In general, the converse is
false, but Tauber had proved that it is true if nan → 0.
Littlewood extended this by weakening the condition
to nan being bounded. This result gave rise to an
In the theory of functions, he did elegant, important,
and innovative work on injective holomorphic func-
tions, the minimum modulus, and subharmonic func-
tions. In particular, he worked on the conjecture that
Bieberbach made in 1916 that if f (z) = z + a2 z 2 +
a3 z3 + · · · is an injective holomorphic function

[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) in the open disk Δ = {z : |z| < 1}, then
|an | ⩽ n for every n. Littlewood proved in 1923 that
|an | < en for every n. After many improvements by
a number of people, the constant e was eventually
reduced to a value close to 1, before de Branges proved
the full conjecture in 1984.
   Littlewood had a lifelong interest in the zeta func-
tion. This is defined in the half-plane Re(s) > 1 by the
absolutely convergent series

and in the whole complex plane by analytic continua-
tion. In fact, the second problem suggested to him by
his supervisor was the Riemann hypothesis that the
zeros of ζ(s) in the “critical strip” 0 < σ < 1 are on
the “critical line” σ = 12 . If true, this famous conjec-     ramanian, Dress, and Deshouillers proved that g(4) is
ture would imply deep results about the distribution of
primes. Most of Littlewood’s work on the zeta function
was done in collaboration with Hardy and concerned
analytic properties of ζ(s).
   In addition to his work with Hardy, he also made
use of the zeta function to prove a striking theorem
about the error term in the prime number theorem
[V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860). The prime number theorem itself had been
proved by hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) and, independently, by
de la vallée poussin [VI.67](/part-06/charles-jean-de-la-valle-poussin-18661962) in 1896. This funda-
mental result states that π (x), the number of primes
less than x, is asymptotic to the “logarithmic inte-

gral” li(x) = 0 (1/ log t) dt. There was much numer-
ical evidence that π (x) < li(x) for all x; in partic-
ular, by 1914 this inequality was known to hold for
all 2 ⩽ x ⩽ 107 . Nevertheless, Littlewood proved that
li(x)−π (x) changes sign infinitely often. Interestingly,
he did not obtain any explicit bound for a value x with
π (x) > li(x); the first such bound, given by Skewes in
1955, was
  Hardy and Littlewood proved important approximate
formulas for ζ(s), which they used to deduce that, in
a certain sense, ζ(s) is “small” on the critical line; this   on two-dimensional compact manifolds; the theory has
was viewed as a breakthrough. Littlewood also studied
the number of zeros of ζ(s) in a rectangle 0 < σ < 1,
0 < t ⩽ T.
  In 1770, in his Meditationes Algebraicae, waring
[VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) asserted on the basis of empirical evidence that
every natural number is the sum of nine nonnegative
integral cubes, nineteen fourth powers, and so on: for
every natural number k there is a minimal integer g(k)
such that every natural number is the sum of g(k)

nonnegative kth powers. In 1909 hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) used
complicated algebraic identities to prove that g(k)
indeed exists, but the bounds he obtained on g(k) were
rather weak. In the 1920 s, in a groundbreaking series of
papers entitled Partitio Numerorum, Hardy and Little-
wood introduced an analytic method that could be used
to tackle not only Waring’s problem of determining
g(k), but many other problems as well. The origins of
this “circle method” of Hardy and Littlewood go back to
1     1     1                   the work of Hardy and ramanujan [VI.82](/part-06/srinivasa-ramanujan-18871920) on the par-
ζ(s) = ζ(σ + it) =
1 s   2     3                    tition function, but the technical difficulties that Hardy
and Littlewood had to over come were much greater
than in that earlier work. This method enabled them to
show, for example, that every sufficiently large number
is the sum of nineteen fourth powers. (In 1986, Bala sub-
indeed 19.) More importantly, they gave an asymptotic
estimate for the number of representations of n as a
sum of at most s positive kth powers.
The circle method also provides a possible line of
attack on Goldbach’s conjecture that every even num-
ber greater than two is the sum of two primes, and
gives strong heuristic evidence for the strengthened
version of the twin prime conjecture that the number of
primes p ⩽ n such that p + 2 is also a prime is asymp-
n
totic to c 2 (1/(log t)2 ) dt for a constant c > 0. The so-
called k-tuple conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood is a
further extension of this conjecture for “constellations
x
of primes.”
Much of Littlewood’s remarkable work on harmonic
analysis was done in collaboration with R. E. A. C.
Paley in the early 1930 s. The starting point of the
littlewood–paley theory [VII.3 §7](/part-07/wavelets-and-applications) is an inequality
concerning trigonometric polynomials. Roughly speak-
ing, Littlewood and Paley related the size of a function
101000
to the projection of its fourier coefficients [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform)
1010            .                     onto various intervals. The original one-dimensional
Littlewood–Paley theory has been extended to higher
dimensions, arbitrary intervals, and even to tensors
connections to such varied topics as wavelets [VII.3](/part-07/wavelets-and-applications),
semigroups acting on Lp -spaces of functions with val-
ues in a banach space [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces), and the geometry of null
hypersurfaces for rough Einstein metrics.
Littlewood was also a formidable applied mathe-
matician. During World War I he worked on ballistics,
and during World War II, with his collaborator Mary
Cartwright, he worked on the van der Pol oscillator
in order to help the development of radio. Cartwright
