the points of such loci by two coordinates linked by an
equation (although he chose a different way of taking
coordinates from the usual modern x and y coordin-
ates). More over, Fermat gave the standard forms of the
corresponding equation when the locus to be found
was a line, a parabola, an ellipse, etc.
   Fermat also used algebraic analysis to solve prob-
lems of extrema, including finding the tangent or the
normal to a curve at a given point, and determining
centers of gravity. His method relies on the principle
that a certain algebraic expression takes on the same
values twice near the extremum. Although the proce-
dure is purely algebraic, his successors tended to inter-    Mahoney, M. 1994. The Mathematical Career of Pierre de

applied the method to a variety of problems, includ-
ing (within the framework of a controversy with Des-
cartes’s followers around 1660) a proof of the law of
refraction in optics. Basing his analysis on the principle   VI.13
that “nature acts in the shortest time,” Fermat was able     b. Clermont-Ferrand, France, 1623; d. Paris, 1662
to express the problem as one of extrema and to solve it
with his method. The problem of refraction was one of
the first complex physical problems to be treated in a
thoroughly mathematical way, and Fermat’s approach
later led to variational methods [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods).
   However, Fermat also showed a perfect mastery of
more classical, for instance Archimedean, techniques,
which he used when dealing with other types of geo-
metrical questions such as quadrature.
   Such versatility also appears in Fermat’s work on
numbers. On the one hand, he was happy to apply his
algebraic approach to Diophantine analysis in order
to obtain solutions for cases previously thought to be
in soluble, or to derive new solutions from ones already
known. On the other hand, he advocated a theoretical
study of the integers, for which the currently available     arrangement of the binomial coefficients n     k , with k

algebraic theory of equations was not sufficient. For
example, he gave general properties of the divisors of
numbers of the form an ± 1 (among them his now cel-
ebrated little theorem [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic)) and of x 2 + Ny 2 for
various N. He invented the method of infinite descent
specifically to deal with problems concerning integers.
He used this method, which relies on the impossibility
of constructing an infinite strictly decreasing sequence
of integers, to prove that a4 − b4 = c 2 has no nontrivial   and 0 ⩽ k ⩽ n. In his Traité du Triangle Arithmétique

last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem), which Fermat only stated in the
margins of one of his books: an + bn = c n has no non-
trivial integer solutions for n > 2. The first proof of the   Traité is famous too for its explicit statement of the
general case was given by Andrew Wiles in 1995.

In 1654 Fermat exchanged letters with pascal [VI.13](/part-06/blaise-pascal-16231662)
on the idea of a “fair game” and on the redistribution of
the stakes if a game is interrupted before its end. These
letters introduced important concepts in probability,
including expected value and conditional probability.
