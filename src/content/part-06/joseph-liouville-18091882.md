contributions to the development of mathematical
logic. He is particularly remembered for what we now
call de Morgan’s laws, which he first published in 1858
in a paper in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philo-
so phical Society. The “laws” can be stated (using the
notation of sets) as follows. If A and B are subsets of a
set X, then (A ∩ B)c = Ac ∪ B c and (A ∪ B)c = Ac ∩ B c ,
where “∪” represents union, “∩” represents inter sec-
tion, and a superscript “c” denotes the complement
with respect to X.

Liouville was the leading French mathematician in
the generation between cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and hermite
[VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901). He taught analysis and mechanics at his alma
mater, the École Polytechnique, until 1851, when he
became professor at the Collège de France. More over,
he was professor at the Sorbonne from 1857 and mem-
ber of the Paris Academy of Sciences and the Bureau
des Longitudes. In 1836 he founded the Journal de
Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées, which exists to
this day.
   His wide-ranging research was often inspired by
physics. For example, his early theory of differential
operators of the form (d/dx)k , where k is an arbitrary
complex number, had its origin in Ampère’s electro-
dynamics. Similarly, Sturm–Liouville theory, which he
developed in around 1836 with his friend C. F. Sturm,
was inspired by the theory of heat conduction. Sturm–
Liouville theory deals with a linear self-adjoint second-
order differential equation involving a parameter that
must be chosen so that there exist nontrivial solutions
(eigenfunctions) that satisfy given boundary-value con-
ditions. Liouville’s main contribution to this theory was
a proof that an “arbitrary” function has a convergent
“Fourier expansion” in terms of eigenfunctions. Sturm–
Liouville theory was a major step toward a more qual-
it ative theory of differential equations, and the first
work on spectral theory of a general class of differential
operators.
   In 1844 Liouville gave the first proof that there exist
transcendental numbers [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers), of which a well-
known example is n=1 10−n! . In a similar vein, in the
1830 s he had already shown that there are elemen-
tary functions such as et /t whose integrals are not

expressible in elementary (or closed) form, i.e., in terms
of algebraic functions, exponentials, and logarithms.
In particular he proved that the elliptic integrals are
nonelementary.
Around 1844 Liouville suggested an entirely new ap-
proach to elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) (inverses of ellip-
tic integrals), based on a systematic investigation of
doubly periodic complex functions and in particular
the observation that such a function must have sin-
gularities if it is not constant. When Cauchy heard
of this theorem he immediately generalized it to the

tion must be a constant. Today this is called Liouville’s
In mechanics, Liouville’s name is connected with the
theorem stating that the volume in phase space is con-
stant when a mechanical system moves according to
hamilton’s equations [III.88 §2.1](/part-03/symplectic-manifolds). In fact, Liouville
proved the constancy of a certain determinant [III.15](/part-03/determinants)
formed from the solutions of a general class of differ-
ential equations. It was jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) who pointed out
that the theorem applied to Hamilton’s equations, and
Boltzmann who interpreted the determinant as the vol-
ume in phase space, and emphasized its importance in
statistical mechanics.
Liouville made many other important contributions
to mechanics and to potential theory. For example,
Jacobi had postulated that when the angular momen-
tum of a fluid planet revolving around an axis is high
enough, there are two shapes that are in equilibrium
in their rotating frames of reference: an ellipsoid of
revolution and an ellipsoid with three different axes.
Liouville showed that Jacobi was right, and more over
proved the surprising result that only the latter fig-
ure is in stable equilibrium. Liouville published only
the result, leaving the verification to Lyapunov and
poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) (at least if the angular momentum is
not too large).
The first mathematician to recognize the significance
of galois’s [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832) theory of solvability of equa-
tions [V.20](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-halting-problem), Liouville did a great service to algebra
when he published some of Galois’s most important
papers in his journal.
