VI.75.    Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer

   Riesz found these two theorems partly in connection
with his study of integral equations, a topic then being
developed by hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and partly in connection
with his study of functional analysis as formulated by
Maurice Fréchet. Hilbert’s work had led him to con-
sider infinite matrices, which were then little studied:
Riesz wrote the first monograph on them, Les Systèmes
d’Équations Linéaires à une Infinité d’Inconnues (1913).
He also studied the theory of Lp spaces for p > 1
(that is, spaces of functions f such that f p is measure-
integrable over some specified interval) and their dual
spaces Lq , where 1/p + 1/q = 1; and he worked on
applying his and Fischer’s theorem to the self-dual
space, now known as hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), that is
given by p = 2. Later he laid some of the foundations
of complete spaces (later known as banach spaces
[III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces)), and applied functional analysis to ergodic
theory. He summed up much of his work in these
areas in the book Leçons d’Analyse Fonctionnelle (1952),
written with his student B. Szökefnalvy-Nagy.
   All this work constituted important contributions to
theories already laid out in principle by various other
mathematicians. Riesz achieved groundbreaking work
on subharmonic functions: he modified the dirich-
let problem [IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis) by allowing the function that
extends a given function into a domain to be subhar-
monic (“locally less than harmonic”) instead of har-
monic. He studied some of the applications of these
functions to potential theory.
   Riesz also studied some foundational aspects of set
theory, especially types of ordering, continuity, and
generalized Heine–Borel covering theorems. He also
reformulated the lebesgue integral [III.55](/part-03/measures) in a con-
struc tive manner, using step functions and sets of mea-
sure zero as primitive notions, and avoiding measure
theory [III.55](/part-03/measures) as much as possible.

Brouwer entered the University of Amsterdam at the
age of sixteen, where his teacher was D. J. Korteweg.

The young Brouwer taught himself modern mathemat-
ics, as well as a fair amount of philosophy. As a grad-
uate student he published some original papers on the
decomposition of rotations in four-dimensional space.
He also published a brief monograph on mysticism that
contained a number of ideas that became prominent
in his later philosophy. In his dissertation of 1907 he
solved a special case of hilbert’s [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) fifth problem
(the elimination of different i ability conditions from the
axioms of lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory)), and he presented his
first program for “constructive mathematics.”
The basis of his mathematics was the ur-intuition
of mathematics: the continuum and the natural num-
bers are simultaneously created from intuition. Mathe-
mat ical objects (including proofs) are mental creations.
After sketching the development of the basic parts of
mathematics, Brouwer went on to criticize con tempo-
rary mathematics for transcending the bounds of the
human mind. In particular, he criticized cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918)
for introducing sets beyond human recognition, and
Hilbert for the axiomatic method and for formalism. He
criticized the latter’s consistency program and denied
that “consistency implies existence.”
In his 1908 paper “The unreliability of the logical
principles,” Brouwer explicitly rejected the principle of
the excluded middle as unreliable (and also rejected
Hilbert’s dogma that “all mathematical problems can be
solved in one way or another”). Between 1909 and 1913
Brouwer worked in topology. He continued his work
on Lie groups, and noted that topology (in the style
of Cantor–Schoenflies) was in need of a sound basis.
In his paper “Zur Analysis Situs” (1910), he spelled
out a number of notions and examples (curves, inde-
com pos able continua, three domains with one common
boundary). This was the beginning of his revision of
set-theoretic topology. At the same time he started two
lines of research: one on homeomorphisms from sur-
faces to themselves, establishing fixed point theo-
theorem (a character ization of homeomorphisms of the
Euclidean plane that have no fixed points); and one on
Ivor Grattan-Guinness      vector distributions on the sphere, yielding existence
theorems for singular points, and a character ization

is Brouwer’s “hairy ball theorem” (no matter how one
combs a hairy ball, there is always a crown). In 1910
Brouwer published a direct topological proof of the Jor-
dan curve theorem, which remains one of the most ele-
gant proofs. The so-called new topology opened with
Brouwer’s “invariance of dimension” theorem (1910).
