Theologie.” However, the result was so powerful that it
has been said that it killed algebraic invariant theory.
   In 1893 Hilbert and Minkowski were asked by the Ger-
man Mathematical Society to write a report on number
theory. Hilbert chose algebraic number theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)
and transformed the results of the nineteenth century
into the study of algebraic number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields). The
deep organizing structure Hilbert found eventually led
to what has been called “the magnificent edifice of class
field theory” (described in [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871)).
   Hilbert’s classic Foundations of Geometry, first pub-
lished in 1899 and revised many times, starts with real-
number arithmetic. He assumes that it is consistent, i.e.,    theory. His second problem asked for a proof that
that it is free of the possibility of contradictory deduc-    first arithmetic, and then set theory, were consistent.
tions. Using analytic geometry, he then exhibits a model
of euclidean geometry [II.2 §3](/part-02/geometry-origins). A point is a pair of
real numbers; a line is a set of pairs of numbers that
satisfy the equation for a line; a circle. . . ; and so on.   increasingly focused on a program to formally axiom-
All of Euclid’s axioms are true statements about these
“lines” and “points,” that is, they are true statements
about these sets of real numbers. Euclidean geometry
is there by reduced to a fraction of all the true state-
ments about real numbers, and we conclude that if real-
number arithmetic is consistent then Euclid’s geometry
is consistent. Next Hilbert constructs models of var-
ious non-Euclidean geometries in terms of Euclidean
geometry, exploring in depth and with great inventive-
ness which possible axioms follow from which groups
of axioms and which are independent yet consistent.
   Hilbert was invited to address the Second Interna-
tional Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900.
He gave a talk proposing twenty-three problems for
the new century. These problems are known today as
“Hilbert’s problems”; in a sense they have created a vir-
tual Göttingen where mathematicians have entered into
conversation with Hilbert and each other ever since.
   Next Hilbert turned to analysis. weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897)
had found counterexamples to Dirichlet’s principle,
which is essentially the assertion that, in variational
problems, maxima and minima are always attained.
Hilbert proved a modified, but still powerful, version
that “salvaged” much of the work that assumed the
principle. The larger theme of this period, though, was
integral equations and what is now called hilbert
space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Newton’s equations for motion are dif-
ferential equations, and it was natural to phrase equa-
tions in physics that way. However, in many cases it
was easier to solve problems if the equations were
written using integrals rather than derivatives. Between
1902 and 1912 Hilbert attacked a variety of problems

from this direction. He viewed the solutions as part of
Hilbert space and gave a spectral interpretation analo-
gous to an infinite-dimensional vector space. Thus,
an amorphous sea of functions acquired geometric
structure.
In 1910 he turned toward mathematical physics and
had some successes, but physics was under going mul-
tiple revolutions and was not ready for mathematical
clarification.
When he delivered his problems in 1900, Hilbert
was aware that there were contradictions in mathe-
matics as it was then phrased, and specifically in set
As the debate widened, some mathematicians began
to pull back on what they accepted as valid reason-
ing. Hilbert wanted none of this. By 1918 he was
atize mathematics and prove it free of contradictions
using proof-theoretic, combinatorial methods. gödel
[VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness theorems in 1930
and there by showed that Hilbert’s program, at least as
initially conceived, could never be successful. Hilbert
was wrong here, but even if wrong, his dream of plac-
ing mathematics on a formal foundation stimulated
some of the most important work of the twentieth
century—and mathematics did not pull back.

In 1883, the Paris Academy of Sciences awarded its
prestigious Grand Prix for mathematical science to
the eighteen-year-old student Hermann Minkowski. The
prize problem was to give the number of representa-
tions of an integer as a sum of five squares of inte-
gers. In a manuscript of 140 pages written in German,
Minkowski developed a general theory of quadratic
forms [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) that contains the solution to this problem
as a special case. Two years later, Minkowski obtained
his Ph. D. in Königsberg, and in 1887 he received his
