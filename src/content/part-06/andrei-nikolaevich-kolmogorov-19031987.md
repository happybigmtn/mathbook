Because he did not hold a chair, he could not be des-

first student, Andrzej Mostowski; instead Kuratowski
assumed that role.
   An invitation to attend a Unity of Science meeting (an    Tarski, A. 1986. Collected Papers, four volumes. Basel: Birk-
offshoot of the Vienna Circle) at Harvard brought Tarski
to the United States two weeks before the Nazi invasion
of Poland on September 1, 1939. Given his Jewish ori-
gins, this probably saved his life, but the war separated
him from his family. (His wife and immediate family
survived the war, but most of the rest of his family
perished in the Holocaust.) In the United States he was
granted a permanent nonquota visa within months, but
only temporary positions were available to him during
the period 1939–42. Finally, he succeeded in obtaining
a position as Lecturer in the Department of Mathemat-
ics of the University of California at Berkeley. There

In the following decade, through his charismatic teach-
ing and zealous campaigning for additional ap point-
ments in the field, he built a program in logic and
the foundations of mathematics that made Berkeley a
mecca for logicians from all over the world for years
to come.
   It was not until 1939 that Tarski wrote up his deci-
sion procedure for algebra and geometry for publi-
cation; it was slated to appear as a monograph for
a Parisian publisher, but that was aborted follow-
ing the invasion of France by Germany in 1940. A
revised version with full details was finally prepared
with the assistance of J. C. C. Mc Kinsey as a RAND
Corporation report in 1948; it only became publicly
available a few years later through the University
of California Press. This work then became par a dig-
matic for the applications of model theory to alge-
bra in which the Tarski school led the way; the sub-
ject has continued to be one of the most important
parts of mathematical logic to this day. At Berke-
ley during the postwar period Tarski also promoted
substantial developments along several different lines:
algebraic logic, the axiomatics of set theory and the
significance of large cardinal [IV.22 §6](/part-04/set-theory) assump-
tions for mathematical problems, and the axiom at-
ics of geometry. Above all, the importance of Tarski’s
work lay in opening the field of logic to the unre-
strict ed use of set-theoretical methods, combined with
a constant attention to rigorous and proper conceptual
development.

Kolmogorov was one of the greatest mathematicians
of the twentieth century. His work was distinguished
both by its great depth and power, and by its breadth:
he made important contributions to several different
areas. He is most famous for his work on probabil-
greatest probabilist ever.
Kolmogorov’s mother, Mariya Yakovlena Kolmogo-
rova, died in childbirth; his father, Nikolai Matveevich
Kataev, an agronomist, worked for the Ministry of Agri-
culture after the Revolution and died in the Denikin
offensive in the Civil War in 1919. Kolmogorov was
brought up by his mother’s sister Vera, whom he
regarded as his mother and who lived to see her
adopted son’s success.
After his childhood in Tunoshna, near Yaroslavl on
the Volga, Kolmogorov became a student of math-
ematics at Moscow University in 1920. His teachers
included Aleksandrov, Lusin, Urysohn, and Stepanov.
Kolmogorov’s first work, published in 1923 when he
was still nineteen, gave an example of a (Lebesgue inte-
grable) function whose fourier series [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) diverges
almost every where. (This is in contrast to the classi-
cal theorems giving regularity conditions on a func-
tion that are sufficient for its Fourier series to converge
to it.) This famous and unexpected result made him a
celebrity, all the more so when in 1925 he sharpened
“almost every where” to “every where.”
Kolmogorov became a postgraduate student in 1925,
studying under Lusin. Also in 1925, he published his
first work on probability theory, in collaboration with
Alexander Yakovlevich Khinchin (Khintchine, Hincin),
on the “three series theorem.” This classical result
gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the con-
vergence of a random series with independent terms,
namely the convergence of three nonrandom series.

The paper also contains the Kolmogorov inequality on
maxima of independent sums. By the time of his doctor-
ate in 1929, Kolmogorov had written eighteen mathe-
mat ical papers: on analysis, on probability, and on intu-
itionist logic, an indication of his lifelong interest in the
foundations of mathematics. He became a professor at
Moscow University in 1931.
   Also in 1931, Kolmogorov published his famous
paper on analytic methods in probability theory. This
deals with Markov processes in continuous time, with
the state space continuous or discrete (in which case
one speaks of a Markov chain). The Chapman–Kol-
mogo rov equations, and the Kolmogorov forward and
backward differential equations, date from this paper.
Diffusions are also treated, developing earlier work by
Bachelier.
   The whole subject of modern probability theory was
given a firm foundation by Kolmogorov’s epoch-making
monograph Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrech-
nung of 1933 (later translated as Foundations of Proba-
bility Theory). Before this time, probability had lacked
a rigorous mathematical foundation, and indeed some
authors had believed that it was impossible to provide
one. However, the relevant mathematical theory, mea-
sure theory [III.55](/part-03/measures), had been introduced by lebesgue
[VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941) in 1902, in connection with his theory of the
integral. Measure theory also provides a firm founda-
tion for the mathematics of length, area, and volume. By
the 1930 s, the subject had been freed from its origins in
Euclidean space. Kolmogorov treated probability sim-
ply as a measure of total mass 1, events as measur-
able sets, random variables [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) as measurable
functions, etc. The decisive technical innovation was
his treatment of conditioning, which used the then-
recent Radon–Nikodým theorem (where by conditional
expectations became Radon–Nikodým derivatives). The
Grundbegriffe also contains two further key results.
The first is the Daniell–Kolmogorov theorem, basic to
the definition of a stochastic process [IV.24](/part-04/stochastic-processes). The
second is Kolmogorov’s strong law of large num-
bers [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions). When we repeatedly toss a fair coin,
we expect the observed frequency of heads to tend
to the expected frequency, a half. Some restriction is
needed to make precise mathematical sense out of
this intuition. It was known before Kolmogorov that
the qualification needed here is that convergence takes
place with probability 1 (“almost surely,” or “a.s.”). Kol-     imal complexity. His later work was dominated by
mogo rov generalized this result from coin tossing to
repeated replication of any random experiment. One
needs the expected value (often called the mean) to

815
exist, in the technical sense of measure theory. Then
the average value in a sample, the sample mean, con-
verges to the expectation, the population mean, with
probability 1.
Further work by Kolmogorov on probability theory
followed in the 1930 s and 1940 s. He worked on limit
theorems, on infinite divisibility, on the Kolmogorov–
Petrovskii–Piscunov equation governing the wave of
advance of an advantageous gene, and on linear pre-
diction of stationary stochastic processes. This appli-
cation, which led to the “Kolmogorov–Wiener filter,”
was motivated by wartime applications to fire control
problems.
This last work led Kolmogorov naturally to path-
breaking work on turbulence in 1941, including the Kol-
mogo rov “two-thirds power” law. This work has been
profoundly important subsequently, as the problem
of understanding turbulence is a central one in fluid
dynamics.
Motivated by questions of the stability of the solar
system, and related dynamical systems [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics), Kol-
mogo rov published in 1954 his work on mechanics and
invariant tori, work that developed into the subject of
“KAM theory” (for Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser).
Kolmogorov’s axiomatization of probability theory
can be regarded as a solution of (part of) Hilbert’s sixth
problem, to put probability and mechanics onto a rig-
orous footing. In 1956 and 1957, Kolmogorov solved
another of Hilbert’s problems, the thirteenth. His solu-
tion gave a surprising structure theorem, by which a
function of many variables can be built up from func-
tions of few variables by means of basic operations.
He showed that a continuous function of any number
of real variables may be built up by combining (using
the operations of addition and of taking a function of a
function) a finite number of functions of only three real
variables. He regarded this work as his most technically
difficult accomplishment.
In the 1960 s, Kolmogorov turned his attention to
foundational questions: in mathematics, in probabil-
ity theory, and in information theory [VII.6](/part-07/reliable-transmission-of-information) and
the theory of algorithms. He introduced the concept
now called “Kolmogorov complexity.” He gave a new
approach to randomness, quite different from that
in his earlier work on probability theory. Here, ran-
dom sequences are identified as sequences of max-
his lifelong interest in teaching, and in particular his
involvement in special schools for particularly gifted
pupils.
