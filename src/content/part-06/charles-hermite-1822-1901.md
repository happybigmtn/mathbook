VI.47 Charles Hermite

b. Dieuze, Moselle, France, 1822; d. Paris, 1901 Analysis (elliptic functions, differential equations); algebra (invariant theory, quadratic forms); approximation theory Like many who aspired to enter the École Polytech-nique, Hermite undertook special preparatory classes, in his case at Lycée Henri IV and Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He began to study serious mathematics, immersing himself in the work ofdre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833), and became interested in the solution oflagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and legen equations by radicals.
Admitted to the École Polytechnique in 1842, by the end of that year he had completed his first significant original work. This extended results of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) in the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem). He sent these to Jacobi, who responded very positively. This achievement both brought him recognition in Paris and initiated a correspondence with Jacobion elliptic functions and number theory that launched Hermite’s career.
commensurate with his abilities, and for almost adecade survived on teaching assistant and examiner Hermite nonetheless struggled to find a position jobs around Paris. Hermite’s work turned to number theory, in particular the arithmetic of quadratic forms, where he followed ing when one form can be reduced to another by a linear gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and Lagrange in study transformation. It was in this context that thetian matrices [III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties) named after him arose.
Her-hermimite was interested in invariants of quadratic forms, and also applied his work to the problem of locationof roots of polynomials. As a result of these efforts, in 1856 he was appointed to the Paris Academy of Sciences, with port ing him.
This appointment was quickly followed liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) and cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) supby Hermite’s 1858 discovery of a means to express the solutions of the general fifth-degree polynomial equa-tion in terms of elliptic functions, which earned him widespread international recognition. ence in Paris in 1869, Hermite became an influential Finally obtaining a professorship at the Faculty of Scimentor for a generation of mathematicians, his best-known protégés including J.
Tannery, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912),

E. Picard, P. Appell, and E. Goursat. Hermite’s dynas-tic connections are also impressive: his brother-in-law, Joseph Bertrand, was permanent secretary of the Paris Academy of Sciences, Picard was his son-in-law, Appell married Bertrand’s daughter, and their daughter mar-ried borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956). His advocacy of improved international communication led to German work becoming much better known in France than it had been previously.
During this period, he obtained a proof ofthe transcendence [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) of “e” using continued fraction approximation theory (which had included the inven-[III.22] methods based on earlier research in tion of the Hermite polynomials). His influence in the mathematical community was strong until his death.

VI.48 Leopold Kronecker

b. Liegnitz, Silesia, today Poland, 1823; d. Berlin, 1891 Algebra; number theory One of the dominant mathematicians of the second half of the nineteenth century, Kronecker is best known today for his constructivist views and his contributions to number theory. After finishing his Ph. D. under the supervision ofleft Berlin and mathematics in order to manage a fam-dirichlet [VI.36] in 1845, Kronecker ily estate and to wind up his father-in-law’s banking business. These activities left him wealthy and free to return to Berlin and concentrate on mathematics without holding an academic position.
In 1855, Kronecker’s former school teacher and closest scientific friend, ernst eduard kummer [VI.40], also came to Berlin and stayed there until his death in 1893. In 1861, Kronecker became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and started teaching courses at Berlin University. Kronecker valued the exchange with his Berlin col-leagues (especially Kummer and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897)) highly, until a quarrel arose between Kronecker and Weierstrass in the 1870 s, which drove Weierstrass to bitter, even anti-Semitic, complaints to others about Kronecker.
After Kummer’s retirement in 1883, Kronecker occupied Kummer’s chair and stepped up his teaching activities as well as the frequency of his publications. This last active period was cut short when hedied, shortly after the death of his wife.
