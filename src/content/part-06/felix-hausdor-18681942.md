this, see operator algebras [IV.15 §1](/part-04/operator-algebras).) The equa-
tions arise in the context of problems of mathematical
physics, e.g., in potential theory and in the theory of
oscillations. Fredholm considered himself primarily a
mathematical physicist, and his colleague Mittag-Leffler
tried in vain to have him awarded the Nobel Prize for
physics.

Analytic number theory; analysis
De la Vallée Poussin graduated in engineering (1890)
and mathematics (1891) from the Université Catholique
de Louvain, where he went on to teach mathematical
analysis from 1891 until 1951. His lectures formed
the basis for his renowned Cours d’Analyse Infinitési-
male, which ran to many editions from 1903 to 1959.
A member of the most famous academies in Europe
and the United States, with honorary doctorates from
Paris, Strasbourg, Toronto, and Oslo, he was the first
president (1920) of the International Union of Mathe-
maticians (now the International Mathematical Union).
He was made a baron in 1930.
  De la Vallée Poussin’s main achievement was his
proof in 1896 of the prime number theorem [V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860)
(an asymptotic estimate for the distribution of prime
numbers in the integers), first conjectured by gauss
[VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) in around 1793. (The theorem was also proved
independently by hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) in the same year,
also using complex function theory.) Shortly afterward,     Butzer, P., J. Mawhin, and P. Vetro, eds. 2000–4. Charles-
de la Vallée Poussin followed his proof with a sharper
error term (1899), which he extended to prime numbers
in an arithmetic progression.
  When lebesgue [VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941) first published his inte-
gral [III.55](/part-03/measures) in 1902, de la Vallée Poussin immediately
grasped its importance and, using an original approach,
described it in the second edition of his Cours d’Analyse   VI.68
(1908). In addition, he introduced the concept of the
characteristic function of a set (1915), and shortly
afterward gave a decomposition theorem for the mea-
sure generated by a continuous function of bounded
variation (1916).
  Of particular importance for approximation theory
and the summation of series is de la Vallée Poussin’s
convolution integral (1908), for approximating peri-
odic functions by trigonometric polynomials. His other
significant results in this field include a lower bound
for the error in the best approximation of a contin-
uous function by a polynomial (1910), and a conver-

gence test and a summation method for Fourier series
(1918).
In 1911 de la Vallée Poussin was responsible for sug-
gesting the Belgian Academy prize question that led to
Jackson’s and Bernstein’s theorems on the order of the
best approximation of a continuous function by poly-
nomials. His existence and uniqueness theorem for the
Chebyshev problem for an over determined system of

ear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm); his interpolation formula
(1908) was fundamental for sampling theory; and his
character ization of new classes of quasi-analytic func-
tions by the rate of decrease of their Fourier coefficients
(1915) was a not able development.
De la Vallée Poussin’s other achievements include
determining a uniqueness condition for multipoint
boundary-value problems (1929), which was a sig-
nif i cant result for the study of nonoscillatory solu-
tions of linear differential equations; and solving var-
ious problems of the conformal representation of
multiply connected regions (1930–31). In potential
theory he extended the concept of capacity to arbi-
trary bounded sets, proved his extraction theorem for
bounded sequences of set functions, and, by intro duc-
ing measure theory into poincaré’s [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) “méthode
de balayage” (“sweeping-out method”) for the dirich-
let problem [IV.12 §1](/part-04/analysis), he paved the way for modern
abstract potential theory.

Felix Hausdorff
b. Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), 1868;
d. Bonn, Germany, 1942
Set theory; topology
Hausdorff studied mathematics at Leipzig, Freiburg,
and Berlin between 1887 and 1891, and then started
research in applied mathematics at Leipzig under Hein-
rich Bruns. After his habilitation (1895) he taught first
at Leipzig and then later at Bonn (1910–13, 1921–35)
and Greifswald (1913–21). He is best known for his
work in set theory and general topology, his magnum
opus being Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (“Basic fea-
tures of set theory”). It was published in 1914 and

VI.68.   Felix Hausdorff

had second and third editions in 1927 and 1935.
The second edition was so heavily revised in content,
however, that it should really be considered a new
book.
  In his early work, Hausdorff concentrated on applied
mathematics, mainly related to astronomy, in particu-
lar the refraction and extinction of light in the atmo-     methods for divergent series and also a generalization
sphere. He had broad intellectual interests and moved
in Nietzschean circles of artists and poets at Leipzig.
Under the pseudonym Paul Mongré he wrote two long
philosophical essays of which the more prominent was
“Das Chaos in kosmischer Auslese” (“The chaos in cos-
mic selection”). Until 1904 he regularly contributed cul-   cept of hausdorff dimension [III.17](/part-03/dimension), which he intro-
tural critical essays to a renowned German intellectual     duced to give a notion of dimension to rather general
review of the time, continuing to contribute, although
less frequently, until 1912. He also published poems
and a satirical play.
  Hausdorff took up set theory at the turn of the cen-
tury and gave his first lecture course on the topic in
the summer semester of 1901 at Leipzig university.
After his turn toward “Cantorianism” (set theory) he
began deep and innovative research on order struc-
tures and their classification. Among the results of his
early work in set theory are the Hausdorff recursion
formula for exponentiation of cardinals and several
contributions to the study of order structures (cofi-
nality, etc.). Although Hausdorff did not pursue active
research in the axiomatic foundation of set theory,
he contributed important insights on transfinite num-
bers, in particular a character ization of what are now
known as weakly inaccessible cardinals and his maxi-
mal chain principle, a form of zorn’s lemma [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) that
predated the latter and differed from it in formulation
and intention.
  His own contribution to the axiomatic method was
oriented toward generalizing classical areas of math-
ematics and founding them on axiomatic principles
within the framework of set theory. Hausdorff’s move
to use set theory inside mathematics was seminal for
the turn toward modern mathematics in the sense
of the twentieth century, most prominently character-
ized by the bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) group. Best known in
this respect are his axiomatization of general topol-
ogy in terms of axioms for neighborhood systems, first
published in the Grundzüge (1914), and the study of
the properties of general, or more specialized, topo-
logical spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces). Less well-known (it remained
unpublished until recently) was Hausdorff’s axiomati-

zation of probability theory, which was presented in

793
a lecture course of 1923 and which preceded kol-
mogo rov’s [VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987) work in this area by about a decade.
He also made important contributions to analysis and
algebra. In algebra, he contributed to lie theory [III.48](/part-03/lie-theory)
(via what is now called the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff
formula), while in analysis he developed summation
of the Riesz–Fischer theory.
Hausdorff’s central goals in using set theory were for
applications to analytical disciplines such as function
theory. Among his most important contributions in this
respect, and of wide-ranging importance, was the con-
sets (such as, for example, fractal-type sets).
Hausdorff realized that analytical questions of set
theory were deeply connected to foundational ques-
tions. In 1916 he (and, independently, P. Alexandroff)
showed that any uncountable borel set [III.55](/part-03/measures) in the
reals actually has the cardinality of the continuum. This
was an important development of a strategy proposed
by Cantor to clarify the continuum. Although this strat-
egy did not finally contribute to the decisive results
by Gödel and Cohen on the continuum hypothesis
[IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), it led to the development of an extended
field of investigation in the border region between set
theory and analysis, now dealt with in descriptive
set theory [IV.22 §9](/part-04/set-theory). Hausdorff’s second edition of
the Mengenlehre (1927) was the first monograph in
this field.
After the rise to power of the Nazi regime, working
conditions and life in general deteriorated more and
more drastically for Hausdorff and others of Jewish ori-
gin. When Hausdorff, his wife Charlotte, and a sister of
hers were ordered to leave their house for local intern-
ment in January 1942, they opted for suicide rather
than suffering further persecution.
