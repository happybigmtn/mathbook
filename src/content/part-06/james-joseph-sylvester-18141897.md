of the Premier Mémoire. This is the remarkable work
in which he introduced what is now called the Galois
group of an equation and showed how solubility of the
equation in terms of radicals could be precisely char-
acterized by a property of the group. It was the Pre-
mier Mémoire which turned the theory of equations
into what is now called galois theory [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic).
   The Second Mémoire also exists. Galois never com-
pleted it, however, nor is it all correct. Nevertheless, it
is an exciting document that focuses on aspects of what
is now recognized as the theory of groups. Its main the-
orem is (in group-theoretic language) that every primi-
tive soluble permutation group has degree a power of
a prime number and may be represented as a group
of affine transformations over the prime field Fp . It
also contains an incomplete study of two-dimensional
linear groups over Fp . The Troisième Mémoire, which
he described as being on the theory of integrals and
elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), has never been found.
   Galois’s main work—comprising the paper “Sur la
théorie des nombres,” the Premier Mémoire, the Second
Mémoire, and the letter to Chevalier—was finally pub-
lished by liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) in 1846. A critical edition
by Bourgne and Azra, including every known fragment
of Galois’s writing, was published in 1962.
   Galois’s legacy is enormous. His ideas led directly
to “abstract algebra” (see [II.3 §6](/part-02/abstract-algebra-development)): when the abstract
notion of field developed later in the nineteenth cen-
tury, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fields
had already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois
theory developed directly out of the material in the
Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed
from the ideas in the Premier Mémoire and the Second
Mémoire together with a series of papers published by
Cauchy in 1845.

As a Jew, Sylvester could neither take the degree he
earned at St John’s College, Cambridge, in 1837 nor

compete for positions at England’s Anglican universi-
ties. This effectively forced him down a convoluted path
toward his personal goal of a career as a research math-
ematician. He worked as an actuary in London in the
1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by pass-
ing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some six
years in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various
times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-
ics, in England and in the United States. Most notably,
Sylvester served as the first Professor of Mathematics
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland,
from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that
finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold pro-
fessorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the
appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-
etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health
forced his retirement in 1894. The program Sylvester
set up at Johns Hopkins established his pivotal place
in the history of American research-level mathematics,
while his mathematical accomplishments had garnered
him an international reputation as early as the 1860 s.
Sylvester entered the research arena in the late 1830 s
with work on the problem of determining when two
polynomial equations have a common root. This nat-
urally led not only to questions in the theory of
determinants but also to an explicit, pioneering, and
self-consciously algebraic analysis of the intermediate
expressions that arise in Charles François Sturm’s algo-
rithm for determining the number of real roots of a
polynomial equation that lie between two given real
numbers (1839, 1840). Sylvester followed this up with
what he called the dialytic method of elimination: a new
criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detect-
ing whether two polynomial equations have a common
root (1841).
His next major research push came in the 1850 s
when, together with cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a
slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More con-
cretely, given a binary form of a particular degree,
Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for ex-
plicitly finding invariants and covariants of that form
and for determining algebraic relations, or “syzygies,”

between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two
important papers: “On the principles of the calculus of
James Joseph Sylvester
tions of two rational integral functions” (1853). In the
latter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law
of inertia: if Q(x1 , . . . , xn ) is a real quadratic form
[III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rank r , then there exists a (real) nonsingular
