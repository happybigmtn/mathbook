and Littlewood were among the first to combine topo-logical and analytical methods to tackle differential equations, and discovered many of the phenomena that later became known as “chaos”: they proved that chaos could arise even in equations originating in real engineering problems. tlewood lived in the same set of spacious rooms in Trin-ity College, Cambridge. He was a great raconteur:

In spite of his tremendous output, he suffered for decades from severe bouts of depression, from which he was cured only in 1957. He practiced his belief that mathemati-cians should take a vacation of at least twenty-one days a year during which they should do no mathematics. He was a keen and skilled rock climber and an avid Alpine skier.
Although not an active musician, on most days he listened to Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart for hourson end. of the Royal Society, the citation read: “Littlewood, on Hardy’s own estimate, is the finest mathematician In 1943, when he was awarded the Sylvester Medal he has ever known. He was the man most likely tostorm and smash a really deep and formidable problem; there was no one else who could command such a combination of insight, technique and power.”

His first teaching positions were at Göt-tingen (1910–13) and ETH Zürich (1913–30).
In 1930 he accepted the call to Göttingen as Hilbert’s successor. After the rise to power of the Nazis, he emigrated to the United States and became a member of the newly founded Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton (1933–51).Weyl made contributions to real and complex analysis, geometry and topology, lie groups [III.48 §1](/part-03/lie-theory), num-

Here Weyl gave riemann surfaces geometric function theory of the twentieth century.[III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces), which became highly influential for the His second book, The Continuum (1918), marked the beginning of Weyl’s interest in the foundations of mathematics.
He was critical of Hilbert’s “formalist” program for an axiomatic foundation of mathematics, and explored the possibility of a semi-formalized arithmetical approach to a strictly constructivist foundation of real analysis. Shortly there after he shifted toward brouwer’s [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966) intuitionistic program and attacked Hilbert’s foundational views even more strongly in afamous article of 1921. In the late 1920 s he developed a more balanced view of the foundational ques-tions.

This was one of thefirst monographs on relativity theory and was among the most influential. The book represented only the tip of the iceberg of his contributions to differential geometry and general relativity.
Weyl undertook this research within a broad conceptual and philosophical framework. One of the outcomes of this approach was his sketched ideas that would later be analyzed in terms of Analysis of the Problem of Space (1923), in which he the geometry ofof gauge fields.
He had already introduced gauge fields fiber bundles [IV.6 §5](/part-04/algebraic-topology) and the study (and the key idea of a point-dependent rescaling of themetric) in 1918 for a generalization of riemannian geometry [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and a geometrically unified field theory of gravity and ele ct ro magnetism.
