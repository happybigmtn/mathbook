but some what impenetrable analytical texts. His first
work, Miscellanea Analytic a (1762), is devoted to the
theory of numbers and algebraic equations and con-

tains many results which he revised and expanded in
his Meditationes Algebraicae (1770). Included in the
latter is the problem known today as Waring’s prob-
lem (that every positive integer is the sum of not more
than nine cubes, or the sum of not more than nineteen
fourth powers, and so on, with a fixed number of sum-
mands depending on the exponent), which was solved
by hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) in the affirmative in 1909 and which
gave rise to important work by hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947) and lit-
tle wood [VI.79](/part-06/john-edensor-littlewood-18851977) in the 1920 s. The Meditationes also
contained the first publication of Goldbach’s conjec-
ture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be writ-
ten as the sum of two primes) and of Wilson’s theorem
(if p is a prime number, then (p − 1)! + 1 is divisible
by p), which was subsequently proved by lagrange
[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813).
  Waring’s problem and Goldbach’s conjecture are dis-
cussed in problems and results in additive number
theory [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859).

In 1766 Lagrange left his native Turin, where he had
been a founding member of what would later become
the Turin Academy of Sciences, to become the math-
ematics direct or at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In
1787 he moved to Paris to take up a position as a pen-
sionnaire veteran at the Academy of Sciences. In Paris
he also lectured at the École Polytechnique, founded
in 1794, and served as one of the members of the
committee that established the modern metric system.
  Lagrange was only nineteen years old when he wrote
to euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) announcing a new formalism to sim-
plify Euler’s method for finding a curve that satisfied
an extremum condition. Lagrange’s method was based
on the introduction of a new differential operator, δ,
to express the independent variations of the coordin-
ates of a curve that produced a local infinitesimal
deformation.
   Using this formalism he derived the differential equa-
tion known today as the Euler–Lagrange equation, the
fundamental equation of the calculus of variations
[III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). Suppose that we wish to find the function y =
y(x) that maximizes or minimizes a definite integral

of the form
b
f (x, y, y ) dx,
a
where y = dy/dx. The equation states a necessary
condition that this function must satisfy:
∂f    d ∂f
−                = 0.
∂y   dx ∂y
This is a typical example of Lagrange’s reductionist
style. Through out his career he sought suitable for-
malisms with which to express and solve the key
problems of mathematical analysis.
Lagrange publicly presented his δ-formalism in a
memoir published in the second volume (1760–61) of
Miscellanea Taurinensia, a review he had helped to
found. He coupled this memoir with another in which
he used the same formalism to formulate a generalized
version of the principle of least action (previously intro-
duced by Maupertuis and Euler). As a result, he was able
to derive the equations of motion of any system of dis-
tinct bodies attracted by central forces depending on
the distances from their centers.
Meanwhile, in the first volume of Miscellanea Tauri-
nensia (1759), Lagrange had published a memoir pre-
sent ing a new approach to the problem of the vibrating

string, where the string is first represented as a dis-
crete system of n particles, and n is then allowed to
tend to infinity. Using this method Lagrange argued
that Euler was right to allow a large class of “func-
tions,” both “continuous” and “discontinuous,” as solu-
tions of this problem, where as d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) had
maintained that only “continuous functions” (that is,
curves expressed by a single equation) could count as
solutions.
Lagrange established a very general program in the
foundations of classical mechanics in these memoirs.
It was based on the interpretation of a continuous
system as a limiting case of a discrete one and the
use of the method of indeterminate coefficients: sup-
posing that P (x) is a polynomial in x, whose coef-
ficients ai (i = 0, . . . , n) depend on some indetermi-
nates, and that P (x) = 0 for all x (in a given interval),
this method consists of deducing the system of equa-
tions {ai = 0}i=n
i=0 , from which the indeterminates are
possibly determined. Lagrange extended this method
to sums of polynomials in several (independent) vari-
ables, and (following Euler, d’Alembert, and many oth-
ers) also used it with respect to power series. This pro-
gram was further elaborated in two memoirs on the
motion of the Moon (1764, 1780), and later realized in
the Méchanique Analitique (1788). Here, the principle
