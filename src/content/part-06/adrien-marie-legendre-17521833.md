of the Jupiter–Saturn memoir in an analysis of the
eccentricities and inclinations of orbits, “Recherches
sur le calcul intégral et sur le système du monde”
(1776). Except for that, Laplace’s mathematical original-
ity is less not able in his analysis of planetary motion
than in his development of the theory of probability.
More in evidence in his astronomical work is his moti-
vation al drive and his power and virtuosity in calcu-
lation, which may indeed have been more important
through out his long career. Laplace was masterful in
finding rapidly convergent series, in obtaining mathe-
mat ical expressions incorporating terms to represent
a multitude of physical phenomena, in justifying the
neglect of inconvenient quantities in order to reach
solutions, and in giving the widest possible generality
to his conclusions.
   The attraction exerted by a spheroid on an external
or internal point proved to be mathematically the most
fertile set of problems in Laplacian planetary astron-
omy. In “Théorie des attractions des sphéroïdes et de
la figure des planètes” (1785) Laplace employed legen-
dre polynomials [III.85](/part-03/special-functions) in a form later called Laplace
functions. He also proved a theorem that stated that all
ellipsoids with the same foci for their principal sections
attract a given point with a force proportional to their
masses. Laplace’s angles appear in his development of
the equation for the attraction of a spheroid on a given
point. Laplace used polar coordinates in this analy-
sis. He transformed the equation into one in Cartesian
coordinates in “Mémoire sur la théorie de l’anneau de
Saturne” (1789). In 1828 George Green dubbed Pois-
son’s application of the formula to electrostatic and
magnetic forces the potential function, the term used
there after in classical physics.

than lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) (who was resident there from
1787) and laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827), he did not quite match their
reputation, though the range of his mathematical inter-
ests was comparably wide. His professional ap point-
ments were modest; however, in 1799 he took over
from Laplace as a graduation examiner at the École
Polytechnique and remained there until his retirement
in 1816. Additionally, in 1813 he succeeded Lagrange
at the Bureau des Longitudes.
Legendre’s early research concerned the shape of
Earth and its external attraction to a point. Solutions of
the differential equations involved led him to examine
properties of the functions that are named after him;
he was in rivalry with Laplace, after whom the func-
tions were named during the nineteenth century. His
other main concern in analysis, and the longest lasting,
was with elliptic integrals. He wrote on them at great
length up to a Traité of 1825–28. But in supplements
of 1829–32 he acknowledged that his theory had just
been eclipsed by the inverse elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem)
of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) and abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829). He also studied vari-
ous other (functions defined as) integrals, including the
beta and gamma functions [III.31](/part-03/the-gamma-function); solutions to differ-
ential equations; and optimization in the calculus of
variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods).
Among Legendre’s contributions to numerical math-
ematics was a beautiful theorem (found in 1789) relat-
ing spheroidal triangles (that is, triangles drawn on the
surface of a spheroid) to spherical triangles, which was
used in the 1790 s by J. B. J. Delambre in the triangula-
tion analysis that led to the specification of the meter.
His most famous numerical result is the least-squares
criterion of curve fitting, proposed in 1805 in connec-
tion with determining the orbits of comets. For him
the criterion was simply one of minimization; he did
not make the connections to probability theory that
Legendre’s Essai sur la Théorie des Nombres (1798)
was the first monograph on this subject. After review-
ing continued fractions [III.22] and the theory of
equations, he focused upon the algebraic branch, solv-

erties of integers, he stressed quadratic reciprocity

ing quadratic and some higher forms. Little in the book
was new; while expanded editions appeared in 1808
and 1830, he had been quickly eclipsed on methods of
proof by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) of the
young Gauss.
