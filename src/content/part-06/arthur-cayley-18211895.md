At the beginning of his career in the 1840 s, Cayley
laid down subjects that in formed much of his later
research. The novelties of his very first undergradu-
ate paper, “On a theorem in the geometry of position”
(1841), are the now-standard notation for determi-
nants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) of arrays set between vertical lines and
the introduction of the Cayley–Menger determinant.
Following hamilton’s [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) discovery of the quater-
nions [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena) (1843), Cayley expressed rotations in
three-dimensional space via the succinctly expressed
mapping x → q −1 xq, a result that led him to the
Cayley–Klein parameters. He outlined the nonassocia-
tive system of the octaves (cayley numbers [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena)),
the intersection of curves (the Cayley–Bacharach the-
orem), and a dual curve called the Cayley an. In major
papers, he described a theory of multilinear determi-
nants and elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) as doubly infi-
nite products. In concert with George Salmon he invest i-
gated the famous twenty-seven lines that lie in a cubic
surface. The most important studies among his juve-
nilia, though, were his first steps in invariant theory
(1845, 1846), the field in which his reputation was
made.
   Between 1849 and 1863, years spent as a quali-
fied London barrister, Cayley broadened his range, but
unlike other gentlemen of science who roamed across
a multitude of subjects, he restricted his activity exclu-    connecting syzygies.
sively to mathematics. This was mostly pure mathe-
matics. He generalized permutation groups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups)
using the calculus of operations as a basis, and he
saw that not only were matrices useful as a notational
device, but they also constituted a study in their own
right. Not generally an excitable person, at the point
of discovery he declared the Cayley–Hamilton theorem
as “very remarkable” and generations of mathemat i-
cians have shared his delight. Matrix algebra was used
in his solution of the Cayley–Hermite problem, which
required a description of those linear transformations
that leave a bilinear form invariant. A special case of the   covered in many instances by chemists. In the last
solution gives rise to the Cayley orthogonal transform
(I − T )(I + T )−1 . The links between quaternions, matri-    him an important line of contact with today’s mathe-
ces, and group theory that he observed in the 1850 s
are indicative of his concern for the organization of
mathematics.

VI. Mathematicians
In the 1850 s, Cayley set in motion his famous mem-
Arthur Cayley
now referred to as multilinear homogeneous algebraic
forms. He discovered Cayley’s formula for the general
form of covariants of binary forms and Cayley’s law for
counting them. In the Sixth Memoir (1859), he demon-
strated that euclidean geometry [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) was part
of projective geometry [I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) rather than the con-
verse. The idea of a projective metric (Cayley’s abso-
lute) was seen by klein [VI.57] in the 1870 s as the
unifying conceptual idea for classifying non-Euclidean
geometries.
For twenty-five years, from 1858, he was the editor
of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Soci-
ety. In astronomy he contributed to the theory of ellip-
tic planetary motion, calculatory work that demanded
an assiduous attention to detail. His work on the lunar
theory was noteworthy, and in one long calculation he
helped to settle an Anglo-French controversy by veri-
fying the correct value for the secular acceleration of
the Moon, which had been established by John Couch
Adams in 1853.
Cayley returned to the academic world in 1863 as
the founding Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathemat-
ics at Cambridge. In 1868 Paul Gordan startled invari-
ant theorists by proving that invariants and covariants
of a binary quantic could be expressed in terms of a
finite basis. This contradicted an earlier result of Cay-
ley’s but, undaunted, he completed his series with a list-
ing of the irreducible invariants and covariants of the
binary form of order 5 (the binary quintic), and their
Many developments in pure mathematics can be
traced back to his minor notes of the 1870 s and 1880 s,
including the theory of knots, fractals, dynamic pro-
gramming, and group theory (the well-known Cay-
ley’s theorem). In graph theory, the number of dis-
tinct labeled trees with n nodes being nn−2 is known
as Cayley’s graph theorem. He brought his theoret-
ical knowledge of graphical trees to bear on the prob-
lem of counting isomers in organic chemistry, thus
prompting questions about the actual existence of cer-
tain chemical compounds that have since been dis-
decade of his life, Cayley set about the task that gave
maticians: the publication of his Collected Mathemat-
ical Papers in thirteen large volumes by Cambridge
University Press.
