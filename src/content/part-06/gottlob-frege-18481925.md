that are not members of themselves: is it a member of
itself or not? (See the crisis in the foundations of
mathematics [II.7 §2.1](/part-02/foundations-crisis).) Cantor himself was aware of
the contradictions that arose from considering the col-
lections of all transfinite ordinal or cardinal numbers,
and what their ordinal or cardinal numbers might be.
The solution Cantor adopted was to regard such collec-
tions as too large, and not really sets at all, but “incon-
sistent aggregates” as he called them. Others, like Zer-
melo, began to axiomatize set theory in an effort to
exclude the possibility of contradictions. The two most
powerful results of the twentieth century to comple-
ment Cantor’s work are those of gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) (who
established the consistency of the continuum hypoth-
esis with zermelo–fraenkel set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory))
and Paul Cohen (who determined the independence of
the continuum hypothesis from Zermelo–Fraenkel set
theory), the latter finally establishing the impossibility
of proving the continuum hypothesis.
   Cantor’s legacy for the history of mathematics has
truly been revolutionary. Above all, his transfinite set
theory for the first time gave mathematicians the
means of dealing with concepts of the infinite in a
careful and precise way.

also came second in the more demanding Smith’s prize
examination. In 1868 he became a Fellow of Trinity,
leaving in 1871 to become the professor of applied
mathematics at University College London. He died of
tuberculosis in 1879.
A versatile mathematician, regarded by many as the
best of his generation, Clifford’s favorite field was
geometry, over which he ranged widely, proving new
results in classical Euclidean geometry as well as in
projective and differential geometry. He was the first
English mathematician to appreciate the work of rie-
mann [VI.49] on differential geometry, and published
a translation of Riemann’s paper “On the hypo the-
ses that lie at the foundations of geometry” in 1873.
He endorsed Riemann’s fundamental reformulation of
geometry, and went even further in speculating that the
curvature of physical space might explain the motion
of matter. He also made a significant application of
the riemann–roch theorem [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), and was among
the first to analyze the complicated topological nature
of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) by showing how to dis-
sect any Riemann surface into simple pieces in a stan-
dard way. He was the first to study a geometry locally
equivalent to plane geometry but topologically distinct
(the flat torus, also known today as the Clifford–Klein
space form after klein’s [VI.57] later more detailed
study of it). In algebra, he invented the biquaternions
(these are like quaternions, but have complex numbers
as coefficients).

out side the foundations of mathematics, especially in
the philosophy of language.
  Frege was trained at Jena and Göttingen, receiving
a Ph. D. under Ernst Schering in 1873. His Ph. D. thesis
addressed the spatial representation of imaginary ele-
ments in geometry, and his 1874 Habilitation essay at
Jena worked out some basic details of what we would
now call “iteration theory.” Though his early work gave
no obvious sign of the revolutionary work to come, with
hindsight one can discern a foundational motif run-
ning through even the apparently conventional math-
ematics of the early work: a conviction that arithmetic
was in some way or other logical, and that geometry
was fundamentally different and less general because it
was grounded in spatial intuition. This is an especially
salient concern in some of his areas of early research,
such as Plücker’s line geometry and riemann’s [VI.49]
complex analysis, where the role of visual re pre sen-
tation was a matter of some dispute. Frege sought to
resolve the dispute by deriving arithmetic and analy-
sis rigorously from logical principles. His motivation
was not so much a desire for certainty: rather, he
held that only “gap-free” proofs can reveal a science’s
fundamental principles.
  Among the features of contemporary logic appear-
ing first in Frege’s core logical writings (Begriffsschrift
(1879) and Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (volume 1,
1893; volume 2, 1903)) are the following.
  (i) Inferences are analyzed within a quantified logic

 (ii) Forms from syllogistic logic (such as “All As are

(iii) The syntax of the language is explicitly displayed,

(iv) Rules of inference and axioms are distinguished;

 (v) “Function” is taken as an undefined primitive con-

ematicians of the time, including one of Frege’s
teachers, Alfred Clebsch, held the concept of func-
tion to be too vague to serve as a basic building
block.) A sharp distinction is enforced between
functions and the things (called objects) that can
be arguments of functions.
(vi) Quantifiers can be iterated, making possible the
logical representations of distinctions such as that
between uniform and pointwise convergence.
However, any simple catalogue of novelties under-
states the crystalline sharpness of Frege’s logical writ-
ing when compared with works with similar aims, such
as the later Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and
russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970). It would be several decades before
logicians approached Frege’s standards for exactness
and clarity. The notation, however, seemed unwieldy
to readers at the time (and since). Here, for example,
is the statement “if not q, then every v is F ” (¬q =⇒
(∀v)F (v)) in Frege’s notation:
v       F(v)
q
(Here     represents negation, v     is the universal
quantifier, and the long vertical line represents the
conditional.)
Frege also wrote an in formal treatise, Grundlagen der
Arithmetik (1884), which has had a profound influence
of propositions, which extends to relations as well
as to propositions of subject–predicate form. We
would today describe Frege’s logical system as a
higher-order predicate calculus.
