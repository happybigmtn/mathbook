included important work on the riemann zeta func-
tion [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory). He was busy working on biological
theory and new ideas in physics at the time of his
sudden death.
   Turing’s short life combined the purest mathematics
and the most practical applications. It was also marked
by other contrasts. Although he promoted the theme of
computer-based artificial intelligence, there was noth-
ing mechanical about his thought or life. The wit and
drama of the “Turing test” have made him a lasting fig-
ure in the popularization of mathematical ideas. The
dramatization of his life, drawing on the extraordinary
secrecy of his war work, and his subsequent persecu-
tion as a homosexual, have also attracted great public
interest.

Robinson was educated at a private Rabbinical school
and then at the Jewish High School in Breslau until
1933, when he emigrated with his family to Palestine.
There Robinson finished high school, going on to study
mathematics at the Hebrew University under Abraham
Fraenkel. He spent the spring of 1940 at the Sorbonne,
but when the Germans invaded France Robinson made
his way to England. There he spent the war as a refugee,
in the service of the Free French Forces. Robinson’s
mathematical talents were soon recognized, and he
was assigned to the Royal Aircraft Establishment in
Farnborough, where he was part of a team designing
supersonic delta wings and reconstructing German V-
2 rockets to determine how they worked. After the
war, Robinson received his M.Sc. degree in mathematics
from the Hebrew University, with minors in physics and
philosophy. Several years later, he completed his Ph. D.
in mathematics at Birkbeck College, London. His thesis,
“On the metamathematics of algebra,” was published in
1951.
  Meanwhile, Robinson had been teaching at the Royal
College of Aeronautics since its founding in Cranfield in

October of 1946. Although promoted to Deputy Head of
the Department of Aeronautics in 1950, in the follow-
ing year Robinson accepted a position, at the rank of
associate professor, at the University of Toronto in the
Department of Applied Mathematics. While at Toronto,
most of his publications were devoted to applied math-
ematics, including papers on supersonic airfoil design
and a book he coauthored with his former student from
Cranfield, J. A. Laurmann, on Wing Theory.
His years at Toronto (1951–57) proved to be a tran-
sitional period in Robinson’s career, as his interests
turned increasingly toward mathematical logic, begin-
ning with studies of algebraically closed fields of char-
acteristic zero. In 1955 he published a book in French
summarizing much of his early work in mathematical
logic and model theory [IV.23](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), Théorie Métamathé-
matique des Ideaux. Robinson was a pioneering con-
tributor to model theory, which at its simplest uses
mathematical logic to analyze mathematical structures
(like groups, fields, or even set theory itself). Given
an axiomatic system, a model is a structure that sat-
Andrew Hodges        isfies the axioms. One of his early impressive results
was a model-theoretic proof, which he published in
1955 in Mathematische Annalen, of Hilbert’s seven-

function over the reals can be expressed as a sum of
by another book, Complete Theories (1956), which fur-
ther extended ideas he had explored earlier in his thesis
on model-theoretic algebra. Here Robinson introduced
such important concepts as model completeness,
model completion, and the “prime model test,” along
with proofs of the completeness of real-closed fields
[IV.23 §5](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory) and the uniqueness of the model completion
of a model-complete theory.
In the fall of 1957 Robinson returned to the Hebrew
University, where he assumed the chair formerly held
by his teacher Abraham Fraenkel in the Einstein Insti-
tute of Mathematics. While at the Hebrew University,
Robinson worked on aspects of local differential alge-
bra, differentially closed fields, and in logic on skolem’s
[VI.81](/part-06/thoralf-skolem-18871963) results dealing with nonstandard models of
arithmetic. These provide models of ordinary peano
arithmetic [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms), the usual arithmetic of the inte-
gers (0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ), but ones that include “nonstandard”
elements, “numbers” that extend the scope of the stan-
dard model to models that are larger but nevertheless
satisfy the axioms of the standard structure. A non-
standard model of arithmetic may include, for example,
infinite integers. As Haim Gaifman puts it succinctly, “A
