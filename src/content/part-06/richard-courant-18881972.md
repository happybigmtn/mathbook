Ramanujan conjectured that $|τ(p)| < 2p^{11}/ {}^{2}$ for every prime p. The study of this problem led to deep and extensive work on modular forms by H. Petersson, R. Rankin, and others. Eventually, the conjecture was proved by P. Deligne, who received the Fields Medal for his achievement in 1978 . The full story of Ramanujan’s life makes his achievements all the more amazing. As a child he was mathematically precocious. In high school he won prizes in mathematics. On the basis of his high school record, he won a scholarship to the Government College in Kumbakonam in 1904 .
At about this time, Ramanujan came into contact with the book A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics by G. S. Carr. This rather eccentric book is essentially a huge collection of formulas and theorems compiled for students preparing for the celebrated Mathematical Tripos examination at Cambridge. This book fascinated Ramanujan, who became obsessed with mathematics. In college, he neglected his other subjects and gave his all to mathematics. Consequently, he failed some subjects and lost his scholarship.
By 1913 , Ramanujan seemed destined for obscurity--he was now a mere clerk in the Madras Port Trust. Friends encouraged him to write to English mathematicians about his mathematical discoveries. Eventually he wrote to G. H. Hardy, who was able to discern that Ramanujan was a truly extraordinary mathematician. Hardy arranged for Ramanujan to travel to England, and between 1914$and$1918 the two of them produced the groundbreaking work described above. In 1918 , Ramanujan became ill with a sickness diagnosed as tuberculosis. He convalesced in England for a year.
His health improved a little in 1919 and he was able to return to India. Unfortunately, his health worsened after his return, and he died in 1920 . During this last year in India he penned the pages now known as Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook and therein laid the foundations of the theory of mock theta functions, a class of functions similar to but more general than the classical theta functions.

Richard Courant

b. Lublinitz, Silesia (then part of Germany, now Poland), 1888 ; d. New York, 1972 Mathematical physics; partial differential equations; minimal surfaces; compressible flow; shock waves The long and eventful life of Courant was full of high achievements: in mathematical research, the applications of mathematics, as a teacher of many future mathematicians, as a writer of superb books on mathematics, and as an organizer and administrator of large institutions.
The fact that Courant--an outsider in his native Germany and a refugee in the United States-- could accomplish these things is a testament to his personality as well as to his scientific outlook. Born in Lublinitz, Courant completed his high school training in Breslau, living on his own and supporting himself by tutoring. His older Breslau friends, Hellinger and Toeplitz, went on to Göttingen, then the mecca of mathematics, and in due course Courant followed them.
There he was taken on as an assistant to hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and he began a close friendship with Harald Bohr, which was later extended to Harald’s brother Niels. Under Hilbert’s direction, Courant wrote his dissertation on the use of dirichlet’s principle [IV.12](/part-04/analysis) (on minimizing energy) for constructing conformal maps. Courant also used Dirichlet’s principle in several further mathematical studies. During World War I Courant was drafted into the army as an officer; he fought on the western front and was seriously wounded.
After returning to academic life he turned his energies to mathematics and proved some remarkable results: an isoperimetric inequality for the lowest frequency of a vibrating membrane; and the Courant max-min principle for the eigenvalues [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of a self-adjoint operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), so useful in studying the distribution of eigenvalues of the operators of mathematical physics. In 1920 Courant was named as klein’s [VI.57] successor as professor in Göttingen;
the appointment was pushed through by Klein and Hilbert, who saw, correctly, that he shared their vision of the relationship between mathematics and science, that he would strike a balance between research and education, and that he had the administrative energy and wisdom to push his mission to fruition. Courant became close friends with the publisher Ferdinand Springer. One of the fruits of this relationship was the famous “Grundlehren” series of monographs,
