analysis (until robinson [VI.95](/part-06/abraham-robinson-19181974) some hundred years
later). He also defined the real numbers based on the
rationals (although Dedekind’s and cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918)
approaches proved more accessible). He was there by
largely responsible for the “arithmetization of analy-
sis” (a term coined by klein [VI.57]). Among his remark-
able contributions to real analysis are his introduction    Further Reading
of uniform convergence (introduced independently by
P. L. Seidel) and his example of an every where-contin-
uous and no where-differentiable function (Cauchy and
his contemporaries believed that a continuous function
was differentiable except possibly at isolated points).
   Both riemann [VI.49] and Weierstrass (succeeding
Cauchy) founded complex function theory, but they
had fundamentally different approaches to the subject.
Riemann’s global, geometric conception was based on
the notion of a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and on the
dirichlet principle [IV.12 §3.5](/part-04/analysis), while Weierstrass’s
local algebraic theory was grounded in power series
and analytic continuation [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). “The more I
ponder the principles of function theory—and I do so
incessantly—the more I am convinced that it must be
founded on simple algebraic truths. . . ,” he asserted in   on a deep study of the theory of hinge mechanisms. In
a letter to H. A. Schwartz. He severely criticized the
Dirichlet principle for being mathematically not well-
grounded, and produced a counterexample, after which
his approach to complex analysis became dominant
until the early twentieth century. Klein commented on
Weierstrass’s general approach to mathematics: “[He]
is first of all a logician; he proceeds slowly, system at-    argument. It was in this context, in particular consid-
ically, step-by-step. When he works, he strives for the     ering the approximation of functions by polynomials,
definitive form.”
   Weierstrass’s name is attached to various concepts
and results, among them the Weierstrass approximation
theorem, which says that a continuous function can be
uniformly approximated by polynomials; the Bolzano–
Weierstrass theorem, which states that every infinite,
bounded set of real numbers has a limit point; the
Weierstrass factorization theorem, which gives the rep-     by Tn (cos θ) = cos(nθ), for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . These poly-
resentation of an entire function in terms of an infinite    nomials also satisfy the recurrence relation Tn+1 (x) =
product of “prime functions”; the Casorati–Weierstrass
theorem, which says that in every neighborhood of an
isolated essential singularity an analytic function takes   Un (cos θ) = sin((n + 1)θ)/ sin θ and the recurrence
values arbitrarily close to any assigned complex num-
ber; the Weierstrass M-test, which deals with the com-
paris on of series for convergence; and the Weierstrass
℘-function, an example of an elliptic function [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem)
of order 2.
   Weierstrass was most proud of his work on Abelian
functions, and much of his fame in the nineteenth cen-

771
tury rested on it. His results in this field are, however,
less significant today. For us, his main legacy is his
unrelenting insistence on maintaining high standards
of rigor and seeking the fundamental ideas underlying
mathematical concepts and theories.

b. Okatovo, Russia, 1821; d. Saint Petersburg, Russia, 1894

Scientific Committee of the Ministry of Education (1856)
Fascinated by Watt’s parallelogram (the linkage used in
steam engines) and the problem of converting circular
motion into rectilinear motion, Chebyshev embarked
particular, he sought the linkage that would produce
the minimum deviation from a straight line over a given
range. This corresponds to the mathematical problem
of finding, from among the class of functions cho-
sen to approximate a given function, the one with the
smallest absolute error for all specified values of the
that Chebyshev discovered the polynomials now named
after him (see [III.85](/part-03/special-functions)). These polynomials were first
published in his memoir “Théorie des mécanismes con-
nus sous le nom de parallélogrammes” (1854), and they
marked the beginning of his important contributions to
the theory of orthogonal polynomials.
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined
2 x Tn (2) − Tn−1 (x), where T0 (x) = 1 and T1 (x) =
x. Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind satisfy
relation Un+1 (x) = 2 x Un (x)−Un−1 (x), where U0 (x) =
1 and U1 (x) = 2 x.
Chebyshev also had a significant impact on num-
ber theory, coming close to proving the prime number
theorem [V.26](/part-05/the-prime-number-theorem-and-the-vi34-jnos-bolyai-18021860). In probability he is remembered for
Chebyshev’s inequality, a result that is simple but has
innumerable applications.
