by this calculus. This is closely linked with the modern
notions of geometry and topology.
  Leibniz was one of the pioneers of actuarial theory.
Using mathematical models of human life he calculated
the purchase price of life annuities both for single per-
sons and for groups of men, and he applied such con-
side rations to the liquidation of a state’s indebtedness.
  From the very beginning of his scientific career Leib-
niz was deeply interested in logic. He conceived of a
general science: that is, of an art of inventing and of
judging all sciences by means of sufficient data and a
suitable universal language or writing. Yet, his “char-
acteristica universalis” and the ensuing logical calculi
remained fragmentary projects. His “calculus ratio cin a-
tor” was meant to be a formalized deduction of truth.
Given that Leibniz was interested in formalizing calcu-
la tions, it is not surprising that he also constructed the
first four-function calculating machine. In constructing
this machine he invented a new technical device, which
he developed in two different versions: the so-called
pinwheel (before 1676) and the stepped drum (from
1693 or earlier).

Taylor was not the first to discover the theorem that
bears his name (James Gregory found the theorem in

1671), but he was the first to publish it and the first to
appreciate its significance and applicability. The theo-
rem, which states that any function that satisfies cer-
tain conditions can be expressed as (what is now known
as) a Taylor series, was published in Taylor’s Metho-
dus Incrementorum Direct a et In versa (1715). In the
Methodus Taylor gave the series as

f (x +h) = f (x)+
(as it would appear in modern notation). Although Tay-
lor did not attend to questions of rigor—there is no
consideration of convergence, of the remainder term,
or of the validity of expressing a function by such a
series—his derivation of the series was not out of line

with the standards of its day. Taylor used the theorem
for approximating the roots of equations and for solv-
ing differential equations. Although he was aware of
its use for expanding functions into series, he does not
appear to have fully appreciated its significance in this
respect.
Taylor is also noted for his contribution to the prob-
lem of the vibrating string (discussed in the Methodus
and in earlier papers) and for a book on the theory of
linear perspective (1715).

Goldbach is remembered today for the conjecture that
bears his name: that every even number greater than 2
is a sum of two primes. This was first stated by euler
[VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in 1742 in a letter to Goldbach in response to the
earlier proposal by Goldbach that every number greater
than 2 is a sum of three primes (Goldbach considered
1 as a prime number). Goldbach’s conjecture, together
either prime or the sum of three primes, was first pub-
lished by waring [VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) in 1770 but with out attribu-
