Logic; relativity theory
Born in Brno, Moravia, Gödel did his most important
work at the University of Vienna. In 1940 he emigrated
to the United States, where he accepted an appointment
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
  Considered the greatest mathematical logician of the
twentieth century, Gödel is renowned for his proofs of
three fundamental results: the semantic completeness
of first-order logic [IV.23 §2](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory); the syntactic incom-
pleteness of formal number theory [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem); and
the consistency, relative to the axioms of zermelo–
fraenkel [IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) set theory, of the axiom of
choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) and the generalized continuum hypoth-
esis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory).
  Gödel’s completeness theorem (1930) is concerned
with the following kind of question: how do we know
that a statement in group theory, for example, that is
true in every group is actually provable from the axioms
of group theory? Gödel showed that in any first-order
theory (one in which quantifiers are allowed over ele-
ments but not over subsets), any statement true in all
models is indeed provable. In an equivalent form, this
completeness theorem states that any set of statements
that is consistent (that is, from which no contradiction
may be derived) has a model—a structure in which all
those statements hold.
  Gödel’s incompleteness theorem (1931) sent shock
waves through logic and the philosophy of mathemat-
ics. hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) had set out a program in which all
statements (in number theory, for example) should be
derivable from a fixed set of axioms. It was generally
believed that such a program was in principle possible,
until the incompleteness theorem destroyed that hope.
  Gödel’s idea was to construct a statement S that, in
effect, asserts “S is not provable.” A moment’s thought
shows that such a statement must be both true and
unprovable. Gödel’s remarkable achievement was to
manage to encode such a statement in the language
of number theory. His proof applies to such axioms as
the peano axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms) for number theory, and more

generally, to any reasonable extension of them (such as
the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory).
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem represented
another blow to the Hilbert program. Suppose that
Wolfgang Coy   we have a set of axioms T (for example, the Peano
axioms) that is consistent. Can we prove that it is con-
sistent? Gödel showed that, if T is consistent, then
Kurt Gödel
the statement “T is consistent” (when encoded as a
statement of number theory) cannot be proved from T .
So “T is consistent” is an explicit example of a true
but unprovable statement. Again, this applies when T
is the set of Peano axioms, or any reasonable exten-
sion there of (roughly, any extension that allows one
to encode into arithmetic statements about pro vab il-
ity and the like). As a slogan: “a theory cannot prove its
own consistency.”
The axiom of choice became highly controversial
when Ernst Zermelo used it to prove that every set can
be well-ordered, a task that, together with the proof
of the continuum hypothesis, Hilbert had listed first
among the problems he posed in 1900 to the Inter-
national Congress of Mathematicians. In 1938 Gödel
showed that both the axiom of choice and the gen-
eralized continuum hypothesis are consequences of
another principle (the axiom of construct i bility) that
holds in a submodel of any model of Zermelo–Fraenkel
set theory. Both are consequently consistent with (not
disprovable from) the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Much
later (1963) Paul Cohen showed that both statements
are also independent of (not provable from) those
axioms.
Apart from logic, Gödel also worked in relativity
theory, where he established the existence of models
of einstein’s field equations [IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations) that permit time
travel into the past.

André Weil was one of the most influential mathemat i-

both to his original contributions to a remarkably broad
spectrum of mathematical theories, and to the mark
