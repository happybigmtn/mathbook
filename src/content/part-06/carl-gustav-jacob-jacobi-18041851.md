Non-Euclidean geometry
János Bolyai’s father Farkas Bolyai taught him mathe-
matics at home, using the first six books of euclid’s
[VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) Elements and euler’s [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) Algebra. Between
1818 and 1823 János studied at the Royal Engineer-
ing Academy in Vienna, and then served as an engi-
neer in the Austrian Army for ten years, before retir-
ing on a pension as a semi-in valid. Probably inspired
by his father’s attempts to prove the parallel pos-
tulate, a key assumption in Euclidean geometry, but
very much against the advice of his father, János also
attempted to prove it. But in 1820 he switched direc-
tion and attempted to show that there could be a geom-
etry independent of the parallel postulate. By 1823 he
believed he had succeeded, and after much subsequent
discussion father and son agreed to publish the son’s
ideas as a twenty-eight-page appendix to his father’s
two-volume work on geometry in 1832.
   In this appendix, Bolyai started from a new definition
of parallels, according to which, given a line in a plane
and a point not on the line, there are many lines through
the point that do not meet the given line. Of these
lines, there are two that are asymptotic to the given
line (one in each direction), and Bolyai called these the
parallels to the given line through the given point. He
went on to derive many results that follow from this
assumption in the geometry of two and three dimen-
sions, and gave formulas for the new trigonometry of
triangles. He showed that these formulas reduce to the
familiar formulas of plane Euclidean geometry when

the triangles are very small. He also found a surface in
his three-dimensional geometry in which geometry is
Euclidean. He concluded that there were logically two
geometries and that it remained undecided which one
corresponded to reality. He also showed that in his new
geometry it was possible to construct a square equal in
area to a given circle, thus accomplishing a feat that was
widely (and, as was later shown, correctly) believed to
be impossible in Euclidean geometry.
A copy of the book was sent to gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), who
eventually replied on March 6, 1832, that he could not
praise the work, for “to praise it, would be to praise
myself,” going on to claim that the methods and results
in the appendix agreed with his own work over the pre-
Peter M. Neumann            vious thirty-five years, although he was “very glad that
it was just the son of my old friend, who takes the
precedence of me in such a remarkable manner.” This

endorsement of the validity of János’s ideas pleased
the father but infuriated the son, and soured rela-
tions between father and son for several years. They
did eventually resume an uncomfortable relationship,
which persisted until Farkas’s death in 1856.
János Bolyai published virtually nothing else, and his
discovery was not appreciated in his lifetime. Indeed,
it is unclear that anyone but Gauss ever read it, but
specific comments about it that Gauss left behind led
mathematicians back to it, and it was translated into
French by Hoüel in 1867 and into English in 1896
(reprinted in 1912 and 2004).

Jacobi grew up as Jacques Simon Jacobi in a wealthy
and well-educated Jewish family. He was baptized dur-
ing his first year at the University of Berlin in 1821,
probably in order to make it possible for him to follow
an academic career at a time when Jews were ineligible
for academic positions. Jacobi studied classics under
the famous philologist Boeckh and philosophy under
Hegel. Owing to the mediocrity of the mathematics

staff in Berlin at that time, he was self-taught in the discipline, which soon became his favorite. He read euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827), gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), and, last but not least, Greek mathematicians like Pappus and Diophantus. In 1825 , Jacobi was awarded his doctorate for a thesis, written in Latin, on the theory of functions.
The subsequent disputatio (discussion) included critical comments both on Lagrange’s theory of functions and on his analytical mechanics. The following year Jacobi went to the University of Königsberg, where (in 1829 ) he got a full professorship. In 1834 , he and the physicist F. E.
Neumann founded the “Königsberg mathematical physics seminar,” which, because of the close connection between research and teaching that it fostered, soon led to Königsberg becoming the most successful and influential educational institution for theoretical physics and mathematics in the German-speaking part of the scientific world. By 1844 , when Jacobi left Königsberg because of poor health and in order to become a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, he was recognized as Germany’s most important mathematician after Gauss.
After seven more fruitful years of research in Berlin he died unexpectedly from smallpox. Through out his life Jacobi was an advocate of pure mathematics, conceiving mathematical thinking as a means of developing the human intellect and, indeed, of advancing humanity itself. He published his first paper in 1827 : it was devoted to number theory (cubic residues) and was influenced by Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Further investigations were devoted to higher residues, the division of the circle, quadratic forms, and related subjects.
Many of Jacobi’s results in number theory were published in the book Canon Arithmeticus ( 1839 ) . The extension of the concept of divisibility to algebraic numbers by Jacobi and Gauss paved the way for the later algebraic theory of numbers (by kummer [VI.40] and others). Jacobi’s “most original achievements” (in the words of klein [VI.57]) were his contributions to the theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), which developed in competition with abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) between 1827$and$1829 .
Starting with legendre’s [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833) work, Jacobi’s approach was analytical and focused on the transformation of elliptic functions, their properties (like double periodicity), and the introduction of the inverse function. Jacobi’s research on elliptic functions culminated in the book Fundamenta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ellipticarum ( 1829 ). Together with Abel he should be viewed as one of the founders of the theory of complex func- $763$ tions, which emerged in the second half of the century.
In particular, his application of research on elliptic functions to Diophantine equations became important for the development of analytic number theory. Jacobi’s contributions to algebra include investigations into the theory of determinants (the “Jacobi an” functional determinant) and their relation to inverse functions, into quadratic forms (“ Sylvester ’ s law of inertia ”), and into the transformation of multiple integrals. Even Jacobi’s work in mathematical physics bears the stamp of “pure mathematics”:
following the analytical tradition of Euler and Lagrange, he presented the foundations of mechanics in an abstract and formal manner, paying special attention to the relation between conservation laws [IV.12](/part-04/analysis) and symmetries of space and to the unifying role of variational principles.
Jacobi’s achievements in this area, which he developed in close relation to the theory of differential equations and the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods), include what is now called the “Jacobi-Poisson theorem,” the “principle of the last multiplier,” a theory for integrating hamilton’s [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) canonical equations of motion [IV . 16 § 2 . 1 . 3 ](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) by transformation (“ Hamilton - Jacobi theory ”), and a time-independent formulation of the principle of least action (“ Jacobi ’ s principle ”).
His approach to these areas and the results he obtained are documented in two comprehensive books based on his lectures: Vorlesungen über Dynamik ( 1866 ) and Vorlesungen über Analytische Mechanik (not published until 1996 ) . The former had considerable impact on the development of German mathematical physics in the last third of the nineteenth century.
The latter reveals Jacobi’s criticism of the traditional understanding of mechanical principles (as laws that are firmly based on empirical observation or a priori reasoning) and shows strong parallels with the “conventionalist” viewpoint, which did not become popular in science and philosophy until half a century later, when it numbered H. Hertz and poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) among its adherents. Jacobi not only promoted new mathematical developments, but also studied the history of mathematics:
he worked on ancient number theory, was the advisor for the historical parts of A. von Humboldt’s great Kosmos (1845-62), and developed detailed plans for the publication of Euler’s works.
