wave equation for the vibrations of an elliptical mem-brane. These functions, which are special cases of the hypergeometric function, are particular solutions of Mathieu’s equation: d2$u+ (a + 16q cos 2z)u = 0$,$d$ z2

where physical problem.a and q are constants that depend on the Mathieu is also known for his discovery of the five Mathieu groups. These were the first groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups) (meaning that they did not fit into one sporadic simple of the known infinite families of simple groups) to befound. It is now known that there are twenty-six such groups altogether, although it was almost a century after Mathieu before a sixth one was found. VI.52 Camille Jordan b. Lyon, France, 1838; d. Milan, Italy, 1922 Nominally an engineer until 1885; teacher of mathematics, École Polytechnique and Collège de France (1873–1912) Jordan was the leading group theorist of his genera-tion.

This work later created a deep rift between them. (Friendship turned into aloofness and hostility
