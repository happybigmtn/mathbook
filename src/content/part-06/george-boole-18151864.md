   Sylvester surprised the mathematical world in 1864
and 1865 with the first proof of newton’s [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) rule
(Newton had only stated it) for determining bounds on
the number of positive and negative roots of a polyno-
mial equation. However, he then entered a fallow period
that ended only with his move to Baltimore. While there,
he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the
problem of inductively determining, for binary forms
first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4,
etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generat-
ing set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordan
had proved that this number is always finite and, in
so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley,
who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating
set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, the
binary form of degree 5) was infinite. By 1879, Sylvester
had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of
covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two
through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and
filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had
given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly
independent covariants associated with a binary form
of any given degree.
   Sylvester was the founding editor of the Ameri-
can Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this
invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions
(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80),
and on matrix algebras (1884), appeared there.

Boole, who never attended secondary school, college, or
university, was almost entirely self-taught. His father

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested in
building telescopes and scientific instruments than
making shoes—the result being that his business failed
and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen
and take a job as a junior teacher to support his par-
ents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had
mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of
sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-
ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love
of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and
together they built functioning scientific instruments.
Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age of
twenty he was publishing original research in calcu-
lus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers
on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided
the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to
others such as cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897)
to develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded the
Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on opera-
tors in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-
ics to be presented by the society. The paper was
important not only because it contained (arguably for
the first time) a clear definition of the concept of an
operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence
it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for
Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as dif-
ferentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as an
object in its own right. There was an explicit similar-
ity between the laws he derived for functions of D and
the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss
below.
At one time Boole had hoped to become a clergy-
man but family circumstances prevented this. His rev-
erence for creation made him interested in the work-
ings of the human mind, which he regarded as God’s

leibniz [VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) had before him, to explain how the
brain processes information and to express this infor-
mation in mathematical form. In 1847 he published
a book entitled A Mathematical Analysis of Logic in
which he took the first steps toward achieving his

and so made very little impact on the mathematical
world.
George Boole
In 1849 Boole was appointed Professor of Mathe-
matics at Queen’s College, Cork. It was there that he
rewrote and expanded his ideas in a book entitled An
Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854), in which
he introduced a new type of algebra, an algebra of
logic, which evolved into what we now call Boolean
