   Weyl made his most influential contributions to pure
mathematics around the middle of the 1920 s with
his work on the representation theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) of
semisimple Lie groups. Combining cartan’s [VI.69](/part-06/lie-joseph-cartan-18691951)
insights into the representation theory of lie alge-
bras [III.48 §2](/part-03/lie-theory) with methods developed by Hurwitz
and Schur, Weyl used his knowledge of the topology of
manifolds and developed the core of the general theory
of representations of Lie groups in a blend of geo-
metric, algebraic, and analytic methods. He extended
and refined this work and it formed the core of his
later book The Classical Groups (1939)—a harvest of
his work and lectures on this topic during his Prince-
ton years.
   Along with all this work, Weyl actively followed the
rise of the new quantum mechanics. In 1927–28 he
gave a lecture course at ETH on the topic, which gave
rise to his next book on mathematical physics, Group
Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1928). Weyl empha-
sized the conceptual role of group methods in the sym-
bolic representation of quantum structures, in partic-
ular the intriguing interplay between representations
of the special linear group and permutation groups
[III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups). A second step in his gauge theory of the elec-     Polish mathematician Leopold Löwenheim. His conclu-
tro magnetic field was published separately, which gave
rise to a modified gauge theory of electromagnetism.
This was endorsed by leading theoretical physicists,
including Pauli, Schrödinger, and Fock. It served as a
starting point for the next generation of physicists who     a model is a set of mathematical objects that obeys the
developed gauge field theories in the 1950 s and 1960 s.
   Weyl’s research in mathematics and physics was
shaped by his philosophical out look and he included
his philosophical reflections on scientific activity in
many of his publications. Most influential was his con-
tribution to a philosophical handbook, Philosophy of
Mathematics and Natural Science, originally published
in German in 1927 and translated into English in 1949.
It became a classic in the philosophy of science.

Mathematical logic
Thoralf Skolem was one of the major logicians of the
twentieth century, often a lone voice in his under-
standing of the subtle relationship between abstract
set theory and logic. He also worked on Diophantine
equations and on group theory, but his contributions
to mathematical logic have proved the most lasting. He
taught at Bergen and Oslo, was for a time President of
the Norwegian Mathematical Society and an editor of
its journal, and in 1954 was named a Knight of the
First Class in the Royal Order of St. Olav by the king
of Norway.
In 1915 Skolem extended a result obtained by the
sion (published in 1920 and known as the Löwenheim–
Skolem theorem) says that if a mathematical theory
defined using only the first-order predicate calculus has
a model [IV.23 §1](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), then it has a countable model. Here
axioms of the theory. Now, the real numbers are defin-
able in such a theory (for example, zermelo–fraenkel
set theory [IV.22 §3](/part-04/set-theory), or any other axioms for set
theory). From this we obtain the so-called Skolem para-
dox, that the real numbers can be defined in a theory
with a countable model, even though it had been known
since the time of cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) that the real numbers
are uncountable. How can this paradox be resolved?
The answer is that one has to be very careful about
what we mean by “countable.” In this strange count-
able model of set theory, we can see that the reals are
countable, but to the model the reals may be un count-
able. In other words, the actual enumeration of the reals
reals and the natural numbers) may not belong to the
model: the model can be so “small” that it is missing
some functions. Skolem’s paradox highlights the dif-
ference between the viewpoint from out side the model
Several fundamental aspects of Skolem’s work are
visible in these two results, the Löwenheim–Skolem
