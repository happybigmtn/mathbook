  The years after 1903 brought personal tragedies in
Frege’s life and he ceased serious work for over a
decade. Though he resumed writing in 1918 with a
series of philosophical articles, his only research in
mathematics was a brief jotted effort to found arith-
metic on geometry, rather than logic, indicating his
conclusion that his logical program had failed.

A particularly detailed recent example of “neo-Frege an” re-
constructions of Frege’s foundations of arithmetic appears
in John Burgess’s Fixing Frege (Princeton University Press,
Princeton, NJ, 2005). Many of the classic papers on the
technical details of reconstructing Frege’s philosophy of
logic are reprinted in Frege’s Philosophy of Mathematics
(Harvard University Press, Harvard, MA, 1995) by William

Klein had originally intended to be a physicist but dur-
ing the course of his studies with Julius Plücker in Bonn,
with whom he studied both mathematics and physics,
he turned to mathematics, receiving his doctorate for a
thesis on line geometry in 1868. After Plücker’s death in
1868 he went to Göttingen to study with Alfred Cleb-
sch, where he worked exclusively on mathematics. In
1869–70 he spent some months in Berlin studying with
weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) and kummer [VI.40] before join-
ing lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) for a trip to Paris to see hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901).
After passing his habilitation in Göttingen in 1871,
he took positions successively at Erlangen, Munich,
and Leipzig, returning to Göttingen in 1886, where he
remained until he retired (because of poor health) in
1913. In 1875 he married Anna Hegel, a granddaughter
of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
   In 1872 Klein published his celebrated “Erlanger Pro-
gramm,” a creative and unified conception of geom-
etry. Building on a paper of cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) of 1859
in which Cayley had shown how to deduce euclid-
ean geometry [I.3 §6.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from projective geometry
[I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), Klein applied his knowledge of group theory
(learned from jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) in Paris) to create a hier-
archy of all geometries. He had recognized that each
geometry could be characterized by a group of trans-
formations and classified accordingly (see some fun-
da mental mathematical definitions [I.3 §6.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)). The

classification showed, as Klein had anticipated, that of
all the geometries, projective is the most basic and that
the others, e.g., affine, hyperbolic, Euclidean, etc., are
subsumed at some level beneath it. More over, it was
clear from his construction that a contradiction in non-
euclidean geometry [II.2 §§6–10] would simultane-
ously involve a contradiction in Euclidean geometry.
Klein regarded his work in function theory as his
greatest achievement. As his career progressed, he
moved more and more from Plücker’s and Clebsch’s
strictly geometric viewpoint toward the wider out-
look embraced by riemann [VI.49], who had regarded
analytic functions as given by conformal mappings
between given domains. In his “Riemanns The orie der
algebraischen Funktionen und ihrer Integrale” (1882),
Klein gave a geometric treatment of function theory
Jamie Tappenden          in which he fused Riemann’s ideas with the rigorous
power-series methods of Weierstrass.
In 1882, when he was at the height of his powers,
Christian Felix Klein
with poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in the race to develop the theory
of automorphic functions (which are generalizations
of periodic functions such as trigonometric functions,
elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), etc.), during which he had
proved his famous Grenzkreis (boundary circle) The-
orem, had left him exhausted, and he was never again
able to work with such intensity and at such a high level.
After his breakdown Klein’s interest shifted progres-
sively from research toward pedagogy. In his efforts to
modernize mathematical education he developed out-
standing organizational skills and initiated important
and far-reaching editorial projects ranging from the
preparation of lecture notes to coediting the twenty-
four-volume Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissen-
sch af ten (1896–1935). He was an editor of the Mathem-
atische Annalen for almost fifty years, and was among
the founding members of the Deutsche Mathematiker-
Ver einigung (1890). He also played an active role in
establishing mathematical applications in science and
engineering, as well as promoting the better under-
standing of mathematics by engineers.
Among Klein’s other achievements were important
results in the theory of algebraic equations (through
a consideration of the icosahedron he obtained a com-
plete theory of the general fifth-degree equation (1884))
and in mechanics, in which, jointly with Arnold Som-
merfeld, he developed the theory of the gyroscope
(1897–1910). He also worked on ideas involving the
application of group theory to the theory of relativ-
ity, producing papers on the lorentz group [IV.13 §1](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)
