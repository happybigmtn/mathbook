# Alonzo Church (1903–1995)

816

  Kolmogorov’s Selected Works comprise three vol-
umes: Mathematics and Mechanics, Probability and
Statistics, and Information Theory and Algorithms.
  He was widely honored, both within the Soviet Union
and out side. He was married, with no children.

Logic
Church’s career was spent almost entirely at Prince-
ton. Having studied there, he returned, after spending
time in Harvard, Göttingen, and Amsterdam, to take
up a position as an assistant professor in 1929. He
became Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in
1961, a position he held until his retirement in 1967.
He then moved to the University of California at Los
Angeles, where he was Kent Professor of Philosophy
and Professor of Mathematics until he retired (again)
in 1990.
   Princeton became an important center for logic dur-
ing the 1930 s: von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957) arrived at the
beginning of the decade; gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) visited in 1933
and 1935 before moving there permanently in 1940;
and from September 1936 turing [VI.94](/part-06/alan-turing-19121954) spent two
years there as a graduate student, completing his Ph. D.
with Church.
   In 1936 Church made two profound contributions to
the theory of logic. The first, which appeared in a paper
entitled “An unsolvable problem in elementary number
theory,” is what is now known as Church’s thesis: the
proposal to identify the vague intuitive notion of effec-
tive calculability with the precise notion of a recur-
sive function [II.4 §3.2.1](/part-02/algorithms). It quickly transpired that
Church’s definition of a recursive function was equiva-
lent to Turing’s definition of computable functions. At
the end of 1936, Turing, who had been working with
analogous ideas in an entirely different way, published
his famous paper “On computable numbers,” which

contained the result that every function that is natu-
rally regarded as computable is computable by a tur-
ing machines [IV.20 §1.1](/part-04/computational-complexity). Church’s thesis is therefore
often known as the Church–Turing thesis.
The second of Church’s contributions is what is
now known as Church’s theorem. In a short paper
published in the first issue of The Journal of Sym-
bolic Logic, Church showed that it is impossible to
decide algorithmically whether statements in arith-
metic are true or false. It follows that a general solu-
tion to the Entscheidungspr oblem (decision problem)
does not exist; equivalently, first-order logic is unde-
cid able (see the insolubility of the halting prob-
lem [V.20](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-halting-problem)). This result is also known as the Church–
Turing theorem because Turing independently (and in
Nicholas Bingham           the paper referred to above) proved the same result.
In achieving this result, both Church and Turing were

Algebraic geometry; differential geometry; topology
Hodge is famous for his theory of harmonic integrals
(or forms), which was described by weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) as “one
of the landmarks of twentieth century mathematics.”
He was a Scot who spent his early life in Edinburgh but
lived for most of his life in Cambridge, where he was
Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry (an
archaic title) from 1936 until 1970.
Hodge’s work straddles the area between algebraic
geometry, differential geometry, and complex analysis.
It can be seen as a natural out growth of the theory of
riemann surfaces [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) (or algebraic curves) and the
work of Lefschetz on the topology of algebraic vari-
eties [IV.4 §7](/part-04/algebra) (of higher dimension). It put algebraic
geometry on a modern analytic footing and prepared
the ground for the spectacular breakthroughs of the
postwar period in the 1950 s and 1960 s. It also har-
monized well with the later interaction with theoretical
physics, harking back to the influence of James Clerk
Maxwell.
In Riemann surface theory (with one complex dimen-
sion), complex structures and real metrics are very
closely related and the roots of their relationship
can be traced back to the link between the cauchy–
riemann equations [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and the laplace opera-
tor [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). In higher dimensions this close link dis-
appears and a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) seems
