# Gromov’s Polynomial-Growth Theorem

702

Harrington gave the first example of a mathematically significant statement that is unprovable from Peano’s axioms. Their statement is a variant oforem [IV.19 §2.2](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics). Subsequently, many other “natural ramsey’s the incompleteness es” have been found. Of course, the consistency of Peano’s axioms can be proved in a stronger system, since we could just add the(unprovable) consistency statement.
Less trivially, since a model of the natural numbers can be constructed within set theory, the consistency of Peano arithmetic can be proved from[IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) (known as ZFC) for set theory. Of course, the zermelo–fraenkel axioms ZFC cannot prove its own consistency, but the consistency of ZFC can be deduced from a yet stronger sys-tem (for example, adding an axiom that asserts the existence of a suitably “large” cardinal number such as an inaccessible cardinal [IV.22 §6](/part-04/set-theory)).
times possible to find complete axiom systems (that For small enough parts of mathematics, it is someis, systems that allow one to prove every true state-ment). For instance, this can be done for the theory of the natural numbers with zero, the success or function, and addition alone. Thus, multiplication is essential to Gödel’s argument. not It is more elementary to see that Peano’s axioms are categorical: there are models for the axioms that are not isomorphic to the natural numbers.
such standard models of arithmetic contain infinitely large non numbers (that is, numbers that are larger than all natural numbers). phers arguing about whether the human brain is a Gödel’s theorem has been a battleground for philoso deterministic machine (in which case, presumably, we would not be able to prove any formally unprovable statement). Fortunately, there is not enough space inthis article for more details!

Theorem

Ifing that every element of G is a group and g1, . . . , g Gkcan be expressed as a prod-are generators of G (mean- uct of the$g$ and their inverses), then we can define

It turns out that i(f1()4)2 Gis an infinite group, then the rate of growth of the sizes of the sets tell one a great deal about$G$; this is particularly true$γ^{r} can$ when the growth is less than exponential.

with a bit more effort one can improve this bound).Thus, asrtends to infinity, the growth rate of$γ^{r} is$ bounded above by a polynomial of degree the free group [IV.10 §2](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory) generated byg , . . . , gk in r .

More generally, there will be an expo-nential growth rate whenever G contains a non-Abelian free subgroup. likely to be smaller if Gromov’s theorem is a remarkably precise result along These observations suggest that the growth rate is G is more like an Abelian group. these lines. It states that the growth rate of the setsγr

is bounded above by a polynomial inr if and only if Gtion does indeed say that has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. This condi-G is some what like an Abelian group, since nilpotent groups are “close to Abelian” anda subgroup of finite index is “close to the whole group.” For example, a typical nilpotent group is theberg group, which consists of all 3. imes 3 matrices with Heisen- 0 s below the diagonal, 1 s on the diagonal, and integers above the diagonal.
Given any two such matrices X and Yhand corner, and the “error matrix”, the products XY and Y Xdiffer only in the top right-XY -Y X commutes with everything in the group. In general, a nilpotent group is built out of Abelian groups in a controlled manner in a finite number of steps. A fuller discussion of the theorem, including the exact definition of “nilpotent,” can be found in geometric and combinatorial group theory we highlight the fact that it is a beautiful example of a[IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory).
