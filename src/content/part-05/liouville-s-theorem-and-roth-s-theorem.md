G = Gal(f ) \text{has afixed field H}†, which is defined to be the set of all numbersa \in E \text{such that} φ(a) = \text{a for}$all$ H andφ \in HH†. Galois proved that the association between gives a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of Gand fields which lie between Q and E (the so-called intermediate subfields of E). The con- dition thatleads to certain special kinds of intermediate subfields, f (x) has a radical formula for its roots and hence to certain special subgroups oftually to Galois’s most famous theorem: the polyno-G, and even- mialonly if its Galois group Galf (x) has a radical formula for its roots if and(f ) is a soluble group. (This$\text{means that}1$= G < G G<=· · ·Gal< G(f ) has a sequence of subgroups= G such that for each i, G$\text{is agroupnormal subgroup}0$ G^+ /G^1 is Abelian.)[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of$r (G^{i})^{+1} \text{and the factor}^{i}$ It follows from Galois’s theorem that to demonstrate$(i^{1})^{i}$ the insolubility of the quintic, it is enough to produce aquinticf (x) such that Gal(f ) is not a soluble group. An example of such a quintic is$f (x) = 2x^{5} - 5x^{4} +$5: one can show first that Gal(f ) is isomorphic to the symmet- ric group Here is a brief sketch of how the argument goes. First$S^{5}$; and second that S5 \text{is not a soluble group}. one establishes that(i.e., is not the product of two rational polynomials off (x) is an irreducible polynomial smaller degree) with five distinct complex roots. Thus, as observed above, Gal(f ) can be regarded as a sub- group ofing the graph of S5 that permutes the five roots. By sketch-f (x) one can easily see that three of its roots are real and that the other two, call themandα , are complex conjugates of each other. Sinceα1 the complex conjugation map automorphism in Gal2(f ), it follows that Galz \to  $\bar{z}$ always gives an(f ) is a subgroup of Another basic general fact is that the Galois group of an S5 \text{that contains a} 2 - cycle, namely (α1α2). \text{irreducible polynomial permutes the roots meaning that for any two roots}α , α \text{there exists an transitively}, \text{automorphism in Galgroup Gal}(f ) \text{is a subgroup of}(f ) \text{that sends Sthat permutes the fivei} α\text{i jto} αj. Thus, \text{our roots transitively and contains a} 2 - cycle. \text{At this pointsome fairly elementary group theory shows that Gal}5(f ) \text{must actually be the whole of} S \text{is not a soluble group follows easily from the fact} S5. Finally, \text{the fact that that the alternating group group} (i.e., \text{it has no normal subgroups apart from the}5 A5 \text{is a non} - \text{Abelian simple} \text{identity subgroup and}$A5 itself)$. \text{of any degree These ideas can be extended to produce polynomialsn} ⩾ 5 \text{that have Galois group} Sn, \text{and that are therefore not soluble by radicals}. \text{The reason} V. \text{Theorems and Problems this cannot be done for quartics}, cubics, \text{and quadratics is that} S \text{and all its subgroups are soluble groups}. V.22 Liouville’s \text{Theorem and Roth}’s \text{Theorem One of the most famous theorems in mathematics is the statement that}\sqrt{2} \text{is irrational}. \text{This means that there is no pair of integers equivalently that the equationp and} q \text{psuch that}2 = 2 q2 \text{has no integer}\sqrt{2} = p/q, \text{or solutions apart from the trivial solutionp} = q = 0. \text{The argument that proves this can be considerably generalized}, and, \text{in fact}, \text{if coefficients and leading coefficient} 1, \text{then all its roots} P (x) \text{is any polynomial with integer are either integers or irrational numbers}. \text{For example}, sincex3 + x - 1 \text{is negative when} x = 0 \text{and positive whenx} = 1 \text{it must have a root strictly between} 0 and 1. \text{This root is not an integer}, \text{so it must be irrational}. \text{may seem as though not much more can be said}. How - ever, \text{this is very far from true}: \text{given an irrational num}-\text{Once one has proved that a number is irrational}, \text{it ber}, \text{one can ask fascinating and extremely difficult questions arise ashow close it is to being rational}, \text{and soon as one does so}. means, \text{since every irrational number can be approx}-\text{imated as closely as you like by rational numbers}.\text{It is not immediately obvious what this question For example}, \text{the decimal expansion of}1.414213 . . ., \text{which tells us that} \sqrt{2} \text{is within} 1\sqrt{2} begins/100 000 \text{of the rational number} 141 421/100 000. \text{More gener} - ally, \text{for any positive integer integer such thatp}/q < \sqrt{2}, \text{and thenq we can letp}/\text{qp be the largest will be within} 1 to/q\sqrt{of2} \text{with accuracy} 1\sqrt{2}. In other words, if we want an approximation/q, we can obtain it if we use a denominator of However, we can now ask the following question: areq. there denominators accuracy much better than 1 q for which one can one obtain an/q? The answer turns out to be yes. To see this, letsider the numbers 0$,\sqrt{2N}$,2 be a positive integer and con-\sqrt{2}, $. . . , N \sqrt{2}$. Each of these can be written in the formm+α, where m \text{is an integer} andthere areα, the fractional part, lies between 0 and 1. Since N +1 numbers, at least two of their fractional parts must be within 1 can find integersr < s between 0 and/N of each other. That is, we N such that if we write Thus, if we setr \sqrt{2} = n+γα=andα-sβ\sqrt, we have2 = m+β(s, then-r )\sqrt|2α-=βn|-⩽m1/N+γ. andthen|γ\sqrt|2⩽=1/Np/q. If we now let+ γ/q, so |\sqrt{q2}=-sp/q- r|and⩽ 1 p/q N= n. Since- m, N ⩾ q, 1/q N ⩽ 1/q2, so for at least some positive
