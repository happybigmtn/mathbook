# Fermat’s Last Theorem

V.10. Fermat’s Last Theorem

X. Then one can check that f , Unf  = μ(A ∩ T-n A).

It follows that

N-1 f, AN$, M (f ) = N - 1 Mn = M \mu(A ∩ T - n A)$. If we let N - Mtend to infinity, then$A^{N}$, Mf tends to af , g = U-invariant function Unf , g for everygn. Since, and thereforeg is U-invariant, f , g =Ag, g N, M. By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, this is at least(f ), g for every N and M, and finally$f$, g =( g(x) dμ)2 = ( f (x) dμ)2 = μ(A)2. Therefore, \text{we deduce that} (N - 1 N)- \li(m M)→$\i\text{nf ty}$ N - 1 Mn = M μ(A ∩ T - n A) ⩾ (μ(A))2. If you choose two “random sets” of measure then their intersection will typically be$(\mu(A))^{2}$, so theμ(A), inequality above is saying that the average intersection of$A with T^{-n} A$is at least as big as the “expected” intersection. This result, due to Khinchin, gives more precise information about the nature of Poincaré recurrence. measure-preserving transformation as above, it is nat-When a unitary operator is defined in terms of a ural to ask whether the averages converge not just inthe sense of the L2-norm but also in the more clas- sical sense of convergence almost every where. (For arelated thought in a different context, see carleson’s theorem shown by [V.5](/part-05/carlesons-theorem).) \text{The answer is that they do}, \text{as was birkhoff} [VI.78](/part - 06/george - birkho - 18841944) \text{soon after he learned of von Neumann}’s theorem. \text{He proved that for each inte}-\text{grable function fone could find a functionf}* \text{such thatf}*(T x) = f*(x) \text{for almost every} x, \text{and such that} N - 1 N \lim→\i\text{nf ty} N1 n = 0 f (Tnx) = f*(x)\text{for almost everyis ergodic}, let A ⊂x. \text{Suppose that the} \text{transformation} X \text{be a set of positive measure}, and T \text{letfrom Birkhoff}’s \text{theorem that for almost everyf} (x) \text{be the} \text{characteristic} \text{function of} A. \text{It followsx} \in X \text{one has} N \lim→\infty N(1 N)n=-0 1 f (Tnx) = \mu(X)f d\mu = \mu(X)\mu(A).

Or rather, Fermat famously claimed that it was not possible, and that he had a proof that space did not permit him to write down. Over the nextthree and a half centuries, this problem became the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics. Giventhe amount of effort that went into it, one can be virtually certain that Fermat did not in fact have a proof: the problem appears to be irreducibly difficult, and solvable only by techniques that were developed much laterthan Fermat.
