# Fermat’s Last Theorem

V.10. Fermat’s Last Theorem

X. Then one can check that f , Unf  = μ(A ∩ T-n A).

It follows that

N-1 f, AN$, M (f ) = N - 1 Mn = M \mu(A ∩ T - n A)$. If we let N - Mtend to infinity, then$A^{N}$, Mf tends to af , g = U-invariant function Unf , g for ever ygn. Since, and thereforeg is U-invariant, f , g =Ag, g N, M. By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, this is at least(f ), g for every N and M, and finally$f$, g =( g(x) dμ)2 = ( f (x) dμ)2 = μ(A)2. Therefore, we deduce that (N - 1 N)- \li(m M)→$\infty$ N - 1 Mn = M μ(A ∩ T - n A) ⩾ (μ(A))2.
If you choose two “random sets” of measure then their intersection will typically be(\mu(A))2, so theμ(A), inequality above is saying that the average intersection of$A with T^{-n} A$is at least as big as the “expected” intersection. This result, due to Khinchin, gives more precise information about the nature of Poincaré recurrence. measure-preserving transformation as above, it is nat-When a unitary operator is defined in terms of a ural to ask whether the averages converge not just inthe sense of the L2-norm but also in the more clas- sical sense of convergence almost every where.
(For a related thought in a different context, see carleson’s theorem shown by [V.5](/part-05/carlesons-theorem).) The answer is that they do, as was birkhoff [VI.78](/part - 06/george - birkho - 18841944) soon after he learned of von Neumann’s theorem. He proved that for each inte-grable function fone could find a functionf* such thatf*(T x) = f*(x) for almost every x, and such that N - 1 N . im→. nf ty N1 n = 0 f (Tnx) = f*(x)for almost every is ergodic, let A ⊂x.
Suppose that the transformation X be a set of positive measure, and T let from Birkhoff’s theorem that for almost everyf (x) be the characteristic function of A. It follow sx \in X one has N . im→. nfty N(1 N)n=-0 1 f (Tnx) = \mu(X)f d\mu = \mu(X)\mu(A).

Since the expression

$N^{-1N} \lim^{→}$. nfty N1 n=0 f (Tnx)

describes the frequency of visits ofsee that in an ergodic system the images Tnx to the setx, T x, T2 Ax, . . ., we of a typical pointx \in  A visit A with a frequency that equals the proportion of the space occupied by A.

The Fermat–Euler Theorem See modular arithmetic [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic) V.10 Fermat’s Last Theorem Many people, even if they are not mathematicians, are aware of the existence of triples of positive integers(x, y, z)Pythagorean triples such that x: that is$,2 + y2 = z2$.
These give us examples of right-angled triangles with integer side lengths, of which the best known is the “we have that(3, 4, 5) (mtr i angle.” For any two integers2-n2)2+(2 mn)2 = (m2 + n2 m)2, which and n, gives us an infinite supply of Pythagorean triples, andin fact every Pythagorean triple is a multiple of a triple of this form.fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665) asked the very natural question of whether similar triples existed for higher powers: thatis, could there be a solution in positive integers of the equationxn + yn = zn for some power n ⩾3?
For instance, is it possible to express a cube as a sum of two other cubes? Or rather, Fermat famously claimed that it was not possible, and that he had a proof that space did not permit him to write down. Over the next three and a half centuries, this problem became the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics. Given the amount of effort that went into it, one can be virtually certain that Fermat did not in fact have a proof: the problem appears to be irreducibly difficult, and solvable only by techniques that were developed much later than Fermat.
