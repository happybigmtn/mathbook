Together with his friend jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851), he ushered in a new epoch of mathematical teaching at german universities by introducing lectures and seminars on the most recent research, and with him began the golden age of mathematics in Berlin.
Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school, his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind, Eisen-stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891), and riemann [VI.49], among others.

Shortly before graduating in 1827, he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ire-land, a post which he held for the remainder of his life. (1828), was written while he was still an under grad-uate. In it he developed new methods for the study His first paper, “Theory of systems of rays: part first” of foci and caustics produced by the reflection of light from curved surfaces. Hamilton developed his approach to optics over the following five years, pub-li shing three substantial supplements to his original paper.
He showed that the properties of an optical sys-tem are completely determined by a certain “characteristic function” that is a function of the initial and final coordinates of a ray of light and which measures the time of passage of light through the system. In 1832 he predicted that light falling at a certain angle on a biax-ial crystal would be refracted to form a hollow cone of emergent rays. This prediction was verified by his friend and colleague Humphrey Lloyd.

dynamics. In a paper “On a general method in dynam-ics” (1834), he showed that the dynamics of a system Hamilton adapted his optical methods to the study of of attracting and repelling point particles is completely determined by a certain characteristic function, which satisfies a differential equation, today referred to asthe hamilton–jacobi equation [IV.12 §2.1](/part-04/analysis).
In a subsequent paper, “Second essay on a general method in dynamics” (1835), he introduced the tion of a dynamical system, presented the equations principal funcof motion of such a system in[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part-04/mirror-symmetry), and adapted methods of perturbation hamiltonian form theory to this setting.

The fundamental equations of this sys-tem occurred to him in a flash of insight as he was walk-Hamilton discovered the system of quaternions ing along the bank of the Royal Canal, near Dublin, on October 16 of that year. Most of his subsequent math-ematical work involved quaternions. It is not difficult to translate much of this work into the language of modern vector analysis, and indeed many of the basic concepts and results of vector algebra and analysis emerged from Hamilton’s work on quaternions.
Hamil-ton applied quaternion methods to the study of dynamics in a series of short papers published in the three years immediately following his discovery of quaternions. He also investigated a number of algebraic sys-tems related to quaternions. However, most of his work with quaternions was concerned with their application to the study of geometrical problems, and, in particular, to the study of surfaces of the second order and (especially in the final years of his life) to the study of the differential geometry of curves and surfaces.
Much of this research is to be found in his two books Quaternions (1853) and Elements of Quaternions Lectures on(1866, published posthumously).
