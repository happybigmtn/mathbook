# Gromov’s Polynomial-Growth Theorem

702

Harrington gave the first example of a mathematically
significant statement that is unprovable from Peano’s
axioms. Their statement is a variant of ramsey’s the-
orem [IV.19 §2.2](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics). Subsequently, many other “natural
incompleteness es” have been found.
   Of course, the consistency of Peano’s axioms can be
proved in a stronger system, since we could just add the
(unprovable) consistency statement. Less trivially, since
a model of the natural numbers can be constructed
within set theory, the consistency of Peano arithmetic
can be proved from the zermelo–fraenkel axioms
[IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) (known as ZFC) for set theory. Of course,
ZFC cannot prove its own consistency, but the consis-
tency of ZFC can be deduced from a yet stronger sys-
tem (for example, adding an axiom that asserts the exis-
tence of a suitably “large” cardinal number such as an
inaccessible cardinal [IV.22 §6](/part-04/set-theory)).
   For small enough parts of mathematics, it is some-
times possible to find complete axiom systems (that
is, systems that allow one to prove every true state-
ment). For instance, this can be done for the theory of
the natural numbers with zero, the success or function,
and addition alone. Thus, multiplication is essential to
Gödel’s argument.
  It is more elementary to see that Peano’s axioms are
not categorical: there are models for the axioms that
are not isomorphic to the natural numbers. Such non-
standard models of arithmetic contain infinitely large
numbers (that is, numbers that are larger than all
natural numbers).
  Gödel’s theorem has been a battleground for philoso-
phers arguing about whether the human brain is a
deterministic machine (in which case, presumably, we
would not be able to prove any formally unprovable
statement). Fortunately, there is not enough space in
this article for more details!

V.16     Gromov’s Polynomial-Growth

If G is a group and g1 , . . . , gk are generators of G (mean-
ing that every element of G can be expressed as a prod-
uct of the gi and their inverses), then we can define
a Cayley graph by taking the elements of G as vertices

and joining g to h if there is some i such that h is equal
either to ggi or to ggi−1 .
For each r , let γr be the number of elements that are
at a distance of at most r from the identity: that is, the
number of elements that can be written as a “word” of
length at most r in the generators and their inverses.
(For instance, if g = g1 g4 g2−3 , then we know that g
belongs to γ5 .) It turns out that if G is an infinite group,
then the rate of growth of the sizes of the sets γr can
tell one a great deal about G; this is particularly true
when the growth is less than exponential. (The growth
is always bounded above by an exponential function,
since there are at most exponentially many words of a
given length in the generators g1 , . . . , gr .)
If G is an Abelian group generated by g1 , . . . , gk , then

every element of γr is of the form ki=1 ai gi , where
k
a1 , . . . , ak are integers such that i=1 |ai | ⩽ r . It fol-
lows easily that the size of γr is at most (2 r + 1)k (and
with a bit more effort one can improve this bound).
Thus, as r tends to infinity, the growth rate of γr is
bounded above by a polynomial of degree k in r . If G is
the free group [IV.10 §2](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory) generated by g1 , . . . , gk , then
all words of length r in the elements gi (but not their
inverses) give rise to distinct elements of G, so the size
of γr is at least kr . Thus, in this case the growth rate
is exponential. More generally, there will be an expo-
nential growth rate whenever G contains a non-Abelian
free subgroup.
These observations suggest that the growth rate is
likely to be smaller if G is more like an Abelian group.
Gromov’s theorem is a remarkably precise result along
these lines. It states that the growth rate of the sets γr
is bounded above by a polynomial in r if and only if
G has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. This condi-
tion does indeed say that G is some what like an Abelian
group, since nilpotent groups are “close to Abelian” and
a subgroup of finite index is “close to the whole group.”
For example, a typical nilpotent group is the Heisen-
berg group, which consists of all 3 . imes 3 matrices with
0 s below the diagonal, 1 s on the diagonal, and integers

A fuller discussion of the theorem, including the
exact definition of “nilpotent,” can be found in geomet-
ric and combinatorial group theory [IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory). Here
we highlight the fact that it is a beautiful example of a
