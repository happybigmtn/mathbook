   Such a list was found by Kenneth Appel and Wolf-

Others were uneasy about having to trust that the rele-
vant computer program had been written correctly and
that the computer had operated as it should. And in
fact the proof turned out to have several flaws, though
all those that were discovered were subsequently cor-
rected by Appel and Haken in their monograph of
1989. Any doubts there may have been of this kind
were removed once and for all in 1997, when Robert-
son, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas developed another
proof based on similar principles. The part of the proof
that was checkable by humans was made more trans-
parent, and the computer-verified part was supported
by a well-structured collection of data that enabled the
proofs to be checked independently. One could still
question whether the compilers used were correct and
whether the hardware was stable, but the proof has
been checked on different platforms, using different
programming languages and operating systems, so this
proof is much less likely to be in correct than a typical   what you obtain from the real numbers [I.3 §1.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) when

   The result is that very few mathematicians are now
worried about whether the proof is correct. However,
there are many who object to it for a different rea-
son. Even if we can now be certain that the theorem
is true, we can still ask why it is true, and not every-   other polynomial—but that is a judgment with which

Algebra
The complex numbers [I.3 §1.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) can be thought of as
you introduce a new number, denoted i, and stipulate
that it is a solution of the equation x 2 = −1, or equiv-
alently a root of the polynomial x 2 + 1. At first, this
may seem an artificial thing to do—it is not obvious
what is so important about x 2 + 1 as opposed to any

da mental theorem of algebra is one of the best pieces
