Non-Euclidean geometry
János Bolyai’s father Farkas Bolyai taught him mathe-
matics at home, using the first six books of euclid’s
[VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) Elements and euler’s [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) Algebra. Between
1818 and 1823 János studied at the Royal Engineer-
ing Academy in Vienna, and then served as an engi-
neer in the Austrian Army for ten years, before retir-
ing on a pension as a semi-in valid. Probably inspired
by his father’s attempts to prove the parallel pos-
tulate, a key assumption in Euclidean geometry, but
very much against the advice of his father, János also
attempted to prove it. But in 1820 he switched direc-
tion and attempted to show that there could be a geom-
etry independent of the parallel postulate. By 1823 he
believed he had succeeded, and after much subsequent
discussion father and son agreed to publish the son’s
ideas as a twenty-eight-page appendix to his father’s
two-volume work on geometry in 1832.
   In this appendix, Bolyai started from a new definition
of parallels, according to which, given a line in a plane
and a point not on the line, there are many lines through
the point that do not meet the given line. Of these
lines, there are two that are asymptotic to the given
line (one in each direction), and Bolyai called these the
parallels to the given line through the given point. He
went on to derive many results that follow from this
assumption in the geometry of two and three dimen-
sions, and gave formulas for the new trigonometry of
triangles. He showed that these formulas reduce to the
familiar formulas of plane Euclidean geometry when

the triangles are very small. He also found a surface in
his three-dimensional geometry in which geometry is
Euclidean. He concluded that there were logically two
geometries and that it remained undecided which one
corresponded to reality. He also showed that in his new
geometry it was possible to construct a square equal in
area to a given circle, thus accomplishing a feat that was
widely (and, as was later shown, correctly) believed to
be impossible in Euclidean geometry.
A copy of the book was sent to gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), who
eventually replied on March 6, 1832, that he could not
praise the work, for “to praise it, would be to praise
myself,” going on to claim that the methods and results
in the appendix agreed with his own work over the pre-
Peter M. Neumann            vious thirty-five years, although he was “very glad that
it was just the son of my old friend, who takes the
precedence of me in such a remarkable manner.” This

endorsement of the validity of János’s ideas pleased
the father but infuriated the son, and soured rela-
tions between father and son for several years. They
did eventually resume an uncomfortable relationship,
which persisted until Farkas’s death in 1856.
János Bolyai published virtually nothing else, and his
discovery was not appreciated in his lifetime. Indeed,
it is unclear that anyone but Gauss ever read it, but
specific comments about it that Gauss left behind led
mathematicians back to it, and it was translated into
French by Hoüel in 1867 and into English in 1896
(reprinted in 1912 and 2004).

Jacobi grew up as Jacques Simon Jacobi in a wealthy
and well-educated Jewish family. He was baptized dur-
ing his first year at the University of Berlin in 1821,
probably in order to make it possible for him to follow
an academic career at a time when Jews were ineligible
for academic positions. Jacobi studied classics under
the famous philologist Boeckh and philosophy under
Hegel. Owing to the mediocrity of the mathematics
