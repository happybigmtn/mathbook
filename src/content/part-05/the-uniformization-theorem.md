with exciting results continuing to appear. One recent
example is a convergent power-series solution for the
general n-body problem, which was discovered by Don
Wang in 1991.
   Since the three-body problem itself proved so in-
tractable, simplified versions were developed, of which
the most famous is the one now known as the restricted
three-body problem (the name is due to Poincaré),
which was first investigated by Euler. In this case, two     Thurston’s Geometrization Conjecture
of the bodies (the primaries) revolve around their joint
center of mass in circular orbits under the influence
of their mutual gravitational attraction, while the third
body (the planetoid), which is assumed to have such
small mass that the force it exerts on the other two bod-
ies can be neglected, moves in the plane defined by the
primaries. The advantage of this formulation is that the    cation of riemann surfaces [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces). Two surfaces are
motion of the primaries can be treated as a two-body
problem and is hence known; it remains only to inves-
tigate the motion of the planetoid, which can be done
using perturbation theory. Although the restricted for-     ply connected [III.93](/part-03/universal-covers), then the uniformization theo-
mulation might appear artificial, it provides a good
approximation to real physical situations, such as, for     sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane
example, the problem of determining the motion of
the Moon around Earth given the presence of the Sun.
Poincaré wrote extensively on the restricted problem,
and the techniques he developed to tackle it led to his     and negative, respectively); more generally, given any
discovery of mathematical chaos, as well as laying the
foundations for modern dynamical systems [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics)
theory.
   Apart from its intrinsic appeal as a problem that
is simple to state, the three-body problem has a fur-
ther attribute that has contributed to its attraction for
potential solvers: its intimate link with the fund a men-     the whole of C cannot be bi holomorphically equivalent

always keep the same form as it has now, or whether,
eventually, one of the planets will escape or, perhaps
worse, experience a collision. Since bodies in the solar    set, no matter how irregular its boundary might be,
system are approximately spherical and their dimen-
sions extremely small when compared with the dis-
tances between them, they can be considered as point
masses. Ignoring all other forces, such as solar winds or   one set meet at an angle θ, then the angle between

   Over the years, attempts to find a solution to the
three-body problem (and the related n-body prob-
lem), have spawned a wealth of research. As a result,
the importance of the problem is as much in the

mathematical advances it has generated as in the prob-
lem itself. A not able example of this is the develop-
ment of KAM theory, which provides methods for inte-
grating perturbed Hamiltonian systems and obtaining
results that are valid for infinite periods of time. This
was developed in the 1950 s and 1960 s by kolmogorov
[VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987), Arnold, and Moser.

V.34    The Uniformization Theorem
The uniformization theorem is a remarkable classifi-
bi holomorphically equivalent if there is a holomor-
phic function [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from one to the other that
has a holomorphic inverse. If a Riemann surface is sim-
rem states that it is bi holomorphically equivalent to the
[I.3 §6.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). These three spaces can all be viewed as Rie-
mann surfaces, and they are all particularly symmetric:
they have constant curvature [III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) (positive, zero,
two points x and y in such a space, one can find a
symmetry of the space that takes x to y, and one can
ensure that a little arrow at x ends up pointing in any
desired direction at y. Loosely speaking, these spaces
“look the same from every point.”
It can be shown that an open subset of C that is not
theorem, a simply connected open subset of C that is
not the whole of C must be bi holomorphically equiva-
lent to the hyperbolic plane. This proves that any such
can be mapped bi holomorphically to any other. This
result is called the Riemann mapping theorem. Biholo-
morphic maps are conformal: that is, if two curves in
any simple closed curve can be mapped in an angle-
preserving way to the open unit disk. Recall that one of
the main models of the hyperbolic plane is Poincaré’s
disk model. Thus, the hyperbolic metric on the disk
together with the biholomorphic map that is given
by the uniformization theorem can be used to define
