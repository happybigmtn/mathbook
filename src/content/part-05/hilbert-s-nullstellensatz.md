V.17 Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz Letplex variablesf^1, . . . , f^n be a collection of polynomials inz , . . . , z . Suppose that it is possible tod com- find another collection of polynomials1 d g1, . . . , gn such that $f^{1}(z)g^{1}(z) + f^{2}(z)g^{2}(z) + · · · + f^{n}(z)g^{n}(z) = 1$ for every complexlows immediately that no such$d - tuple z = (zd^{1}$, . . . , z-tuple can be a rootd ).
Then it fol- of every single would equal 0. Remarkably, the converse also holds: fi, since otherwise the left-hand side that is, if there is nofall vanish simultaneously, then it is possible to findd-tuple for which the polynomials i

result is known as the A short (but clever) argument can be used to deduce weak Nullstellensatz. Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz This again is a statement where a condition that is obvi-from the weak Nullstellensatz. ously necessary turns out to be sufficient. Suppose thath is another polynomial in d complex variables, that r is a positive integer, and that the polynomial$h^{r} \text{can be}$ written in the form collection of polynomials$f^{1}g^{1} + gf^{2}$, . . . , gg2 + · · · +. It follows imme-fngn for some diately thath(z) = 0 whenever1 f (z)n = 0 for every i.i

Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz states that if$h(z) = 0 when-$ everf (z) = 0 for every i, then there must be somei

positive integerg , . . . , g such thatr and some collection of polynomials hr = f g + f g + · · · + f g . 1 Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz is discussed further in(n1()1()2()2)nalge - n braic geometry [[IV.4 §§5, 12]](/part-04/algebraic-geometry). V.18 The Independence of the

Continuum Hypothesis

The real numbers are uncountable [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets), but do they form the “smallest” uncountable set? Equivalently, isit the case that if A is any set of real numbers, then eitherand the set of all real numbers? The A is countable or there is a bijection between continuum hypoth-A esis (or CH) is the assertion that this is indeed true. The notions of countability and uncountability were invented by cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), who was also the first to

formulate CH. He tried hard to prove or disprove it, asdid many others after him, but nobody succeeded. Gradually, mathematicians came to entertain the idea that CH might be “independent” of normal mathe-matics: that is, independent of the usual zfc axioms [IV.22 §3.1](/part-04/set-theory) of set theory. This would mean that it couldbe neither proved nor disproved from the ZFC axioms. The first result in this direction was due to gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978), who showed that CH could not befrom the usual axioms.
In other words, one could not disproved reach a contradiction by assuming CH. To do this, he showed that inside every model of set theory [IV.22 §3.2](/part-04/set-theory) there is a model in which CH holds. This model is called the “constructible universe.” roughly speaking, it consists just of those sets that “have to exist” if the axioms are true. So, in this model, the setof reals is as small as it could possibly be. The “smallest uncountable size” is usually denoted construction the reals appear inא אstages, with only1, and in Gödel’s countably many reals appearing at each stage.
Fromthis one can deduce that the number of reals is1א , which is precisely the assertion of CH.The other direction had to wait thirty years, until Paul Cohen invented the method ofmake CH false? Starting from some model of set theory forcing. How would we (in which CH might well hold), we would like to “add”some reals to it. Indeed, we would like to add enough that there are now more thanא1 of them. But how do we “add” a real?
We need to ensure that what we end upwith is still a model of set theory, which is hard enough, but also that when we add new reals we do not alter thevalue ofא(since otherwise the statement “the number of reals is1א1” may still be true in the new model). This is an extremely complicated task, both conceptu-ally and technically. See set theory [IV.22](/part - 04/set - theory) for more details about how it is carried out.
