# The Banach–Tarski Paradox

$684$

simplest example involves the elliptic equation dω  +  d ∗ $ω = 0$ , concerning differential forms on a manifold M. The Fredholm index may be identified with the Euler characteristic of M, which is the alternating sum of the numbers of rdimensional cells in a cell decomposition of M. For two-dimensional manifolds, the Euler characteristic is the familiar quantity $V - E + F$ . In the two-dimensional case, the index theorem reproduces the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which asserts that the Euler characteristic is a multiple of the total Gaussian curvature. Even in this simple case, the index theorem can be used to produce topological restrictions on the ways a manifold can curve. Many important applications of the index theorem proceed in the same direction. For example, Hitchin used a more refined application of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem to show that there is a nine-dimensional manifold that is homeomorphic to the sphere despite not being positively curved in even the weakest sense. (By contrast, the usual sphere is positively curved in the strongest possible sense .)

Körner The Banach-Tarski paradox states that there is a way of decomposing a three-dimensional ball of unit radius into a finite number of disjoint pieces, then reassembling the pieces to form two balls of unit radius, where “reassembling” means that the pieces are translated and rotated and that they end up still disjoint. Such a result seems impossible at first sight, and indeed it contradicts the naive assumption that one can consistently assign a finite volume to every bounded set. In other words, it shows that one cannot assign volumes to all bounded sets in such a way that these volumes are unaffected by translation and rotation, that the volume of a union of two disjoint sets is the sum of the volumes of the two sets, and that the volume

of the unit ball is greater than zero. However, if we drop this naive assumption, then the paradox disappears. Since there is no genuine paradox, we shall refer to the Banach-Tarski construction. The Banach-Tarski construction is a descendant of an older construction due to Vitali, which concerns area rather than volume. Let us write l $\theta$ for the line segment in $R^{2}$ that is given in polar coordinates by $l\theta = {(r}$ , $\theta)$ : $0 < r \le 1$ . Note that the union of all such segments is the punctured unit disk D ∗ (that is to say, the unit disk with the origin removed). We say that l $\theta$ and l φ belong to the same equivalence class if $\theta - φ$ is a rational multiple of $\pi$ , and we consider a set E that is the union of a set of l $\theta$ containing exactly one representative from each equivalence class. The rationals are countable [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets), so we can enumerate the rationals $x$ with $0 \le x < 1$ as $a$ sequence $x^{1}$ , $x^{2}$ , . . . . If we write $E^{n} =$ {l $\theta + {}^{2}\p(i^{x})^{n}$ : $l\theta \in$ E}, then each E n is obtained from E by a rotation about the origin (through an angle $2\pi$ x n), the E n are disjoint (as E contains only one representative from each equivalence class), and the union of the E n is D ∗ (as E contains a representative from each equivalence class). Now take D ∗ and split it into the set F consisting of the union of the sets $E^{2n}$ and the set G consisting of the union of the sets $E^{2n} + {}^{1}$ . Each $E^{2n}$ can be rotated to E n , and the union of the E n gives us D ∗ . Similarly, each

$E^{2n} + {}^{1}$ can be rotated to $E^{n}$ , and the union of the $E^{n}$ gives us D ∗ again. Thus the punctured unit disk can be split into a countable set of disjoint pieces (all obtained by rotation of one particular set) which can be rotated and translated to form disjoint sets whose union is two copies of D ∗ . Vitali’s construction makes use of the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) (because we chose one representative from each equivalence class), and the same is true for the Banach-Tarski construction. Solovay showed that if we reject the axiom of choice, then there are models of set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) in which it is possible to assign a volume to all bounded sets in $R^{3}$ in a consistent way. However, most mathematicians would agree that the natural moral to draw from our discussion is that when we define volume we should consider only a restricted collection of sets. The Banach-Tarski construction is also closely related to our final example, which requires a little group
