Let$X1$, X2, . . . be independent and suppose 687 that they are identically distributed. Suppose also that they have mean 0 and variance 1. Then$X + · · · + X$has mean 0 and variance the X are independent.) Therefore, n.

The central limi(tn)1 theorem states that, regard less of the distribution ofthe$Xi$, the random variable Yn converges to a standard normal distribution. It is easy to deduce from this a sim-ilar result for random variables with any finite mean and variance. Details may be found in distributions [III.71 §5](/part - 03/probability - distributions). probability V.7 The Classification of Finite Simple Groups Martin W.
Liebeck A finite group subgroups are the identity subgroup and G is said to be simple if its only normal G itself. To some extent, simple groups play an analogous role infinite group theory to that of prime numbers in number theory: just as the only factors of a prime itself, so the only factor groups of a simple groupp are 1 and G arep the identity group 1 and deeper: just as every positive integer (greater than 1)G itself. The analogy runs a bit is a product of a collection of primes, so every finite group is “built” from a collection of simple groups, in the following sense.

This classification was eventually achieved by the combined efforts of more than one hundred mathematicians in many published research articles and books written over along period, the most intensive being 1955–80. It was a truly monumental feat of prolonged collaboration, and
