1 What Are Rigidity Theorems?

A typicalof objects is much smaller than one might expect. Torigidity theorem is a statement that some class make this notion clear, let us look at some examples ofmoduli spaces [IV.8](/part-04/moduli-spaces) that might lead us to expect that spaces of a certain type would in general be large. 2 Some Moduli Spaces Ais aflat metric metric [III.56](/part-03/metric-spaces) that is locally isometric to the usualon ann-dimensional manifold[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) metric on the Euclidean space Rn.
In other words, every point Nx such that there is a distance-preserving bijectionx in the manifold is contained in a neighborhood fromshall consider flat metrics on a torus. We shall consider Nx to a subset of Rn. For our first example, we just the two-dimensional torus, but the phenomena weshall discuss occur in higher dimensions as well. dimensional torus[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of The simplest way of putting a flat metric on the two-R2 by a discrete subgroup, or T2 is to view it as the lattice quotient, that is isomorphic to Z2.
In fact, it is not too hard to see that everyever, there is a choice involved: the choice of which lat-flat metric arises in essentially this way. Howtice to take. An obvious choice is Z2 itself. But one can also take any invertible linear transformation it to Z2, and then define the torus as R2$/A(Z^{2}A)$, which, apply gives rise to another metric. A natural question to ask is, when do two choices ofric? Usually, one studies only the cases when the A give rise to the same met-deter- minantthese what happens in general.
The group of all such[III.15](/part-03/determinants) of A is 1, since it is easy to deduce from linear maps is called SLIf A is orthogonal, then it just rotates the lattice2(R)$. Z2$ and therefore Z2. What is slightly less obvious is that there are other A(Z2) gives rise to the same metric as maps A that give rise to this metric as well, namely all maps of determinant 1 whose matrices with respect tothe standard basis of R2 have integer entries. The group of all these maps is called SLthen the reason that A(Z^2) gives rise to the same metric^2(Z). If A belongs to SL2(Z), as Z2 is simple:
A(Z2) is actually equal to Z2. tify the space of flat metrics on Loosely speaking, what we have just done is iden-T2 with the set
