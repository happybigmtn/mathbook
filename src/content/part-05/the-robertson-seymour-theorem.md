Aa set graph V (G)G is a mathematical structure that consists ofof vertices and a set E(G) of edges, where each edge links a pair of vertices. Graphs can be used torepresent many different networks in an abstract way. For example, the vertices might represent cities, and the edges might represent highways linking the cities; sim-ilarly, we could use a graph to represent which is lands of an archipelago are linked by bridges, or to repre-sent the wires of a telephone network. Among graphs there are certain families of “nice” graphs. One such family is the family of cycles:
ak-cycle is a set of k ver- tices arranged around a circle with each point joined by an edge to the points immediately before and after it. Another family is that of complete graphs: the complete graph of order of which are joined.k consists of k vertices, all pairs when families of graphs are involved, is that of a Given a graph An important concept in graph theory, particularly G, a minor of G is any graph you can minor. obtain by applying a sequence of operations of two kinds, known as contractions and deletions, applied to edges.
Toand$y$, one “fuses”contract the edge that joins two ver tice sx and y into a single vertex, join-x ing it to all the vertices that were previously joined to either a 9-cycle, you will obtain an 8-cycle.x or y. For example, if you contract an edge of Deleting an edge means what one would guess: for example, if you delete an edge from a 9-cycle you will get a path with nine vertices and eight edges. It is not hard to check that a graph H is a minor of Gsets ofif and only if we can find a collection of disjoint sub-G, one for each vertex of H, with the follow- ing properties:
they should be connected, which means that any two vertices in one of the subsets are joined to each other by a path in that subset, and for any pair of vertices in H that are linked by an edge in H the

two corresponding subsets ofedge. For example, a graph has a 3-cycle (or G should be linked by antriangle) as a minor if and only if it contains a cycle. note that if a graph is planar (meaning that it can be drawn in the plane in such a way that edges do not For an example of how minors can arise naturally, cross), then so is any minor of it. This is expressed by saying that the class of planar graphs is minor closed. Now, there is a theorem of Kuratowski that tells us which graphs are planar. One form that this theorem takes is the following statement:
a graph is planar if and only if it does not have either where K denotes the complete graph of order 5, and K5 or (K3(),){3} as a minor, Kof two sets of three vertices, with every vertex in one se(t3(),){3} denotes the5 complete bipartite graph that consists joined to every vertex in the other set. Thus, the class of planar graphs is characterized by two forbidden minors. Kuratowski’s theorem tells us which graphs can be embedded into the plane. What happens for other sur - faces?
For example, it is easy to see that for anyd the set of graphs that can be drawn on a closed, but is there a finite set of forbidden minors ind-holed torus is minor this case? To put it another way, is the set of obstructions to being embeddable into the finite?d-holed torus only states that the answer to this question is yes for any surface. But the theorem itself is much more general. It A special case of the Robertson–Seymour theorem states that foris a finite set of forbidden minors.
In other words, forany minor-closed class of graphs, there any minor-closed class such that a graph G belongs to the family G there exist graphs G if and only G1, . . . , Gk if G does not have any G as a minor. There is also ai pleasant form of the theorem (which is easily seen to be equivalent) that says that the class of all graphs is “wellquasi - ordered” by the minor relation: this means that given any sequence G , G , . . .

Interestingly, it turns out that the case of graphs embeddable into a given surface plays a key role, as we now explain. 726 above involving a sequence of graphs. So let us suppose We will consider the form of the theorem mentioned for a contradiction that we have a “bad” sequence: thatis, a sequence G , G , . . . for which no G is a minor of any later graph G be Gkj.

This means that in a cer- too far from a graph that is embeddable into the surface.
By some very deep arguments, they were able toshow that the family of all such graphs (the graphs that can be built up from nearly embeddable graphs, for agiven surface) has a finite number of forbidden minors, there by proving the theorem. V.33 The Three-Body Problem The three-body problem can be simply stated: three point masses move in space under their mutual gravita-tional attraction; given their initial positions and velocities, determine their subsequent motion.
Initially, itmay come as a surprise that this is a difficult problem, since the analogous two-body problem can be solved fairly simply: more precisely, given any set of initial conditions, we can write down a formula, in terms of elementary functions (these are functions that can be built up using the basic operations of arith - metic, together with a few standard functions such as the exponential [III.25](/part - 03/the - exponential - and - logarithmic - functions) and trigonometric [III.92](/part - 03/trigonometric - functions) functions), that tells us the subsequent positions and
velocities of the bodies. However, the three-body problem is a complicated nonlinear problem and it can-not be solved in this way, even if we are prepared to enlarge our stock of “standard functions” some what.newton [VI.14](/part - 06/isaac - newton - 16421727) himself speculated that an exact solution “exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind,” while hilbert [VI.63](/part - 06/david - hilbert - 18621943), in his celebrated Paris address of 1900, put the problem in a category similar to fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part - 05/fermats - last - theorem).
The problem can be extended to any number of bodies and inthe general case it is known as then-body problem. V.

The direction of this force on P2 is toward1 in the direction of Pforce equals mass times acceleration. From these two2). Recall also Newton’s second law:
laws we can easily derive the equations of motion forthe three-body problem. Let the particles be P , P , and P3. Write mi for the mass of Pi, rij for the distanc(e1)2 between Pposition of Pi and Pi. Then the equations of motion arej, and qij for the jth coordinate of the d2$(q2()1)i = k2 m2 (q2)i - 3 (q1)i + k2 m3 (q3)i - 3 (q1)i,\}||||||$ d$t r12 r13 ||||\}$ dd2$q(t2)2 i = k2 m1 (q1)ir - 3 (q2)i + k2 m3 (q3)ir - 3 (q2)i,|| (1)$ d2$(q2()3)i = k2 m1 (q1)i - 123 (q3)i + k2 m2 (q2)i - 233 (q3)i.||||||||\}$ d t r13 r23 Here, all derived from the simple laws above.
For instance, the iruns from 1 to 3; thus, there are nine equations, left-hand side of the first equation is the component ofthe acceleration of P in theith direction, and the right- hand side is the component of the force acting on Pthis direction, divided by1 m.1 in If the units are chosen so that1 k2 = 1, then the potential energy Vmof the system is given by2 m3 m3 m1 m1 m2 V = − r23 - r31 - r12 .
Setting pij = mi ddqtij and H = i, j3 = 1 2 p(m2)iji + V , we can rewrite the equations in the[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part - 04/mirror - symmetry) hamiltonian form d qij = . artial H, dpij = − . artial H , (2) dt . artial pij dt . artial qij which is a set of eighteen first-order differential equa - tions. Since this set is easier to use, it is now generally preferred to (1).A standard way of decreasing the complexity of a system of differential equations is to find anintegral for it:
that is, a quantity that will remain con-algebraic stant for any given solution and that can be expressedas an integral that gives rise to an algebraic dependence between the variables. This allows us to reduce the number of variables by expressing some of them in terms of others. The three-body problem has ten independent algebraic integrals: six of them tell us about V.33.
The Three-Body Problem the motion of the center of mass (three for the posi-tion variables and three for the momentum variables), three integrals express the conservation of angular momentum, and one expresses conservation of energy. These ten independent integrals were known to euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783) andteenth century, and in 1887 Heinrich Bruns, professor lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) in the middle of the eighof astronomy at Leipzig, proved that there are no others, a result sharpened by later.
By the use of these ten integrals, together with poincaré [VI.61](/part - 06/jules - henri - poincar - 18541912) two years the “elimination of the time” and the “elimination ofthe nodes” (a procedure first made explicit by jacobi [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851)), the original system of order eighteen can be reduced to one of order six, but it can be reduced no further. Hence, any general solution of (2) cannot be given by a simple formula: the best we can hope foris a solution in the form of an infinite series.
It is not difficult to find series that work well enough for a limited time span: the problem is to find series that work for any initial configuration and for any time span, no matter how long. There is also the question of colli-sions. A complete solution to the problem has to take account of all possible motions of the bodies, including determining which initial conditions lead to binary and triple collisions. Since collisions are described by sin-gularities in the differential equations, this means that to find a complete solution the singularities have to be understood. one might think.
It is obvious from the equations thata collision gives rise to a singularity, but it is less clear This turns out to be a more interesting problem than whether there can be any other kind of singular behav-ior. In the case of the three-body problem, the answer was supplied by Painlevé in 1897: the collisions are the only singularities. However, for more than three bodies the answer turned out to be different. In 1908 a swedish astronomer, Hugo von Zeipel, showed that noncollision singularities becomes unbounded in a finite amount of time.
A good can occur only if the system of particles example of such a singularity was found by Zhihong Xiafor the five-body problem in 1992. In this case there are two pairs of bodies, the bodies in each pair having equal mass, and a fifth body with very small mass. The bodies in a pair move in very eccentric orbits parallel to the xyplane and rotating in opposite directions. A fifth parti--plane, with the two pairs on opposite sides of this cle is then added to the system. Its motion is confinedto thez-axis and oscillates between the two pairs.
Xia showed that the motion of the fifth particle forced the two pairs to move away from thexy-plane, but that it

727

also came closer and closer to colliding with the pairs, giving it larger and larger bursts of acceleration, and that as this happened the two pairs were forced out toinfinity in finite time. one can look for interesting particular solutions. Atral configuration As well as trying to solve the problem in general, is defined to be a solution in which cen the geometric configuration remains constant. The first examples were discovered by Euler in 1767:
they were solutions in which the bodies always lie on a straight line and revolve with uniform angular velocity in circles or ellipses about their common center of mass. In1772 Lagrange discovered solutions in which the bodies are always at the vertices of an equilateral triangle that rotates uniformly about the center of mass.
For almost all sets of initial conditions for these solutions, the size of the triangle changes as it rotates so that each body describes an ellipse. However, despite the discovery of the particular solutions and a century of unrelenting work on the prob-lem, the mathematicians of the nineteenth century were unable to find a general solution. Indeed, the problem was considered so hard that in 1890 Poincaré was led to declare that he thought it impossible with out the discovery of some significant new mathematics.
But, contrary to Poincaré’s expectation, less than twenty years later a young Finnish mathematical astronomer, Karl Sundman, using only existing mathematical techniques, astonished the mathematical world by obtain-ing uniformly convergent infinite series that mathematically “solved” the problem. Sundman’s series, which are in powers oft1/3, are convergent for all real t, except for the negligible set of initial conditions for which the angular momentum is zero.
To deal with binary collisions, Sundman used the technique of regularization the collision, but he was unable to deal with triple colli-, or analytically extending a solution beyond sions because in order for such a collision to occur the angular momentum must be zero. Although it was a remarkable mathematical achievement, Sundman’s solution leaves many questions unan-swered. It provides no qualitative information about the behavior of the system and, worse, because the series converges so slowly it is of no practical use.
Todetermine the motion of the bodies for any reasonable period of time would require the summation of some-thing of the order of 108000000 terms, a calculation that is patently unrealistic. Thus, Sundman left plenty still to do, and work on the problem (and the relate dn- body problem) has continued up to the present day,

728

with exciting results continuing to appear. One recent example is a convergent power-series solution for the generaln-body problem, which was discovered by Don Wang in 1991.Since the three-body problem itself proved so intractable, simplified versions were developed, of which the most famous is the one now known as the restricted three-body problem (the name is due to Poincaré), which was first investigated by Euler.
In this case, twoof the bodies (the primaries) revolve around their joint center of mass in circular orbits under the influenceof their mutual gravitational attraction, while the third body (the planetoid), which is assumed to have such small mass that the force it exerts on the other two bod-ies can be neglected, moves in the plane defined by the primaries. The advantage of this formulation is that the motion of the primaries can be treated as a two-body problem and is hence known; it remains only to investigate the motion of the planetoid, which can be done using perturbation theory.
Although the restricted formulation might appear artificial, it provides a good approximation to real physical situations, such as, for example, the problem of determining the motion of the Moon around Earth given the presence of the Sun. Poincaré wrote extensively on the restricted problem, and the techniques he developed to tackle it led to his discovery of mathematical chaos, as well as laying the foundations for modern dynamical systems [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics) theory. Apart from its intrinsic appeal as a problem that is simple to state, the three-body problem has a fur-ther attribute
that has contributed to its attraction for potential solvers: its intimate link with the fundamental question of the stability of the solar system. Thatis the question of whether the planetary system will always keep the same form as it has now, or whether, eventually, one of the planets will escape or, perhaps worse, experience a collision. Since bodies in the solar system are approximately spherical and their dimen-sions extremely small when compared with the distances between them, they can be considered as point masses.
Ignoring all other forces, such as solar winds or relativistic effects, and taking only gravitational forces into account, the solar system can be modeled as a ten-body problem with one large mass and nine small ones, and it can be investigated accordingly. Over the years, attempts to find a solution to the three-body problem (and the relate dn-body prob- lem), have spawned a wealth of research. As a result, the importance of the problem is as much in the

mathematical advances it has generated as in the prob-lem itself. A not able example of this is the development of KAM theory, which provides methods for integrating perturbed Hamiltonian systems and obtaining results that are valid for infinite periods of time. This was developed in the 1950 s and 1960 s by[VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987), Arnold, and Moser.

Thus, the hyperbolic metric on the disk together with the biholomorphic map that is given by the uniformization theorem can be used to define

a hyperbolic metric on any simply connected proper open subset of C. If a Riemann surface is not simply connected, it is at least aface, namely its quotient universal cover[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of a simply connected sur-[III.93](/part-03/universal-covers). For example, a torus is a quotient of the complex plane (in many possible ways that are topologically but not bi holomorphically equivalent). Thus, the uniformization theorem tells us that a general Riemann surface is a quotient of the sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane.

The Weil conjectures constitute one of the central landmarks of twentieth-century algebraic geometry [IV.4](/part-04/algebra): not only was their proof a dramatic triumph, but they were the driving force behind a striking number of fundamental advances in the field. The conjec-tures treat a very elementary problem: how to count the number of solutions to systems of polynomial equa-tions over finite fields [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).
While one might ultimately be more interested in solutions over, say, the field of rational numbers, the problem is far more tractable over finite fields, andciples [III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory) such as the birch–swinnerton-dyer local–global pr in conjecture tion ships between the two cases.[V.4](/part-05/the-birchswinnerton-dyer-conjecture) establish strong, albeit subtle, rel an on obvious connections to the Weil conjectures.

$ζ(s) =n n1s$.

euler ofs, but Riemann, in his remarkable eight-page paper[VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) had studied this function for real values of 1859, went much further. He looked at complex val-ues as well, and therefore had at his disposal the considerable resources of complex analysis. In particular, although the above sum forζ(s) converges only for complex num be rss that have real part Re(s) strictly greater than 1, Riemann showed that the function itself can be extended to an analytic function defined on the entire complex plane, except at the point$s = 1$, at which it tends to infinity.
He showed, more over, that satisfies a certain functional equation relatingζ(s)ζ(s)toζ(metry around the line Re1 - s), which introduced an important kind of sym-(s) =1. Most famously (or infamously), he conjectured what is now known as the riemann hypothesis [I.4 §3](/part-01/general-goals): that, aside from easily2 analyzed “trivial zeros” on the negative real axis, every zero ofζ(s) occurs on the line Re(s) =1. Riemann’s motivation for studying tr i but i on of prime numbers, but it fell to later authorsζ(s) was to analyze the dis-2 (Van Koch) to bring this vision to fruition.
They used hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), de la vallée poussin [VI.67](/part-06/charles-jean-de-la-valle-poussin-18661962), and the zeta function to prove the[I.4 §3](/part-01/general-goals), which determined the asymptotic distribution prime number theorem of prime numbers, and also showed that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to a particularly strong upper bound for the error term in the prime number theorem.

However, it was not long before At first glance, the Riemann hypothesis might appear dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) generalized the Riemann hypothesis to a whole family ofzeta functions, and in doing so opened the door to further generalization.

For each number field K we have the ring of integers O , which enjoys many of the same properties as the classi-cal integers Z. Starting from this observation, Dedekind$K$ defined a more general class of zeta functions, one for each such ring, which now bear his name.

However, it was not at all straight for-was the Dedekind zeta function in ward to establish the existence of a functional equation for Dedekind zeta functions: this was an open problem$K$ until 1917, when it was settled by Hecke, who showed at the same time that Dedekind zeta functions could be extended to the complex plane, there by ensuring that the Riemann hypothesis makes sense for them as well.
geometry entered the picture.duced zeta functions and the Riemann hypothesis for With such ideas in the air, it was not long before artin [VI.86](/part-06/emil-artin-18981962) first intro certain curves over finite fields in his 1923 thesis, not-ing that the ring of polynomial functions on such a curve shares precisely the properties of rings of inte-gers that Dedekind used to define his zeta functions. Artin quickly observed first that his new zeta func-tions were strongly analogous to Dedekind zeta functions, and second that they were often more tractable:
evidence for both observations is provided by the fact that he was able to check explicitly that the Rie-mann hypothesis was satisfied for a number of specific curves. The difference between the two situations is encapsulated as follows: while in the number field case one can think of the zeta function as counting primes, in the case of a function field the zeta function may be expressed in terms of the more geometric data ofcounting points on the given curve. In a 1931 paper F. K.
Schmidt generalized Artin’s work, and exploited this geometry to prove a strong form of the functional equation for such zeta functions. And then, in 1933, Hasse proved the Riemann hypothesis in the special case of elliptic curves [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) over finite fields. 2 Zeta Functions of Curves We now discuss in more detail the definition and prop-erties of zeta functions associated with curves over finite fields, as well as the theorems of Schmidt and Hasse.

Further more, he proved a functional equa-P (t) is a polynomial of degree 2 g with integer tion in terms of the substitutiont = q-s, this gives a functional equation for the substi-t \to  1/qt. If we set tution s \to 1 - s, as in Riemann’s original work. The Riemann hypothesis for roots of Z (q - s) all have Re C is then the statement that the(s) =1, or, equivalently, that the roots of C P (t) all have norm equal to2 (q - 1()/){2}. It is an elementary observation that this is equivalent tothe assertion that$|N (C) - qm + 1| ⩽ 2g qm$, for allmm ⩾ 1.

This follows because in any field, and in, the polynomial qm (tq)m - t can have at mostqm roots, which must then be precisely the elements of Ffixed point of$q^{m}$.

More- over, we will see that this perspective is woven through-out the fabric of the rest of our story, not only inspiring Weil to make his conjectures, but also suggesting the techniques that ultimately led to their proof.

3 Enter Weil

In 1940 and 1941, Weil gave two proofs of the riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. Or, to be more accurate, he described two proofs: they both relied on fundamental facts in algebraic geometry which had been proved by analytic methods for varieties over the complex numbers, but which had not been proved rig-orously in the case of arbitrary base fields. It was largely in order to address this deficiency that Weil wrote his Foundations of Algebraic Geometry , which appeared in 1948 and allowed both of his earlier proofs to be made rigorous.
geometry, as it introduced for the first time the notionof an Weil’s book constituted a watershed in algebraic abstract algebraic variety. Previously, a variety was always a global object, in that it was defined by a single collection of polynomial equations, in either affine or projective space.
Weil realized that it would be helpful to have a corresponding locally defined concept, so he introduced abstract algebraic varieties, which are obtained by gluing together affine algebraic varieties in much the same way that manifolds in topology are obtained by gluing together open subsets of affine space. The notion of an abstract variety played a fundamental role in formalizing Weil’s proofs, and was also an important precursor to Grothendieck’simmensely successful theory of schemes [IV.5 §3](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry).
letin of the American Mathematical Society The following year, in a remarkable paper in the, Weil went Bul further, studying zeta functions higher-dimensional varieties Vover finite fields, and$Z^{V} (t) \text{associated with}$ taking as his definition the formula (1). While the situ-ation is more complicated in this context, the behavior conjectured by Weil was nonetheless strikingly similar, an utterly natural extension of the case of curves: (ii) more explicitly, if(i)ZV (t) is a rational function of Pn(t)P= . im (t)V· · ·, we can writet;

Betti numbers are a well- known invariant fromwe return to Schmidt’s theorem (2) in the case of curves, algebraic topology [IV.6](/part-04/algebraic-topology): if the degrees 1, 2$g$, 1 of 1 - t, P (t), 1 - qt are precisely the Betti numbers of a complex curve of genusg. 4 The Proof Weil’s conjectures were inspired by a very intuitive topological picture, derived from considering V (F ) as the set of fixed points of moment thatΦmmakes sense only over finite fields,Φq m.

there could be a cohomology theory for algebraic varieties over finite fields that would mimic the properties of the classical topological theory and would allow one to prove the Weil conjectures. Such a cohomology theory is now known as a Serre was the first to seriously attempt to develop such Weil cohomology. a theory, but he had only limited success. In 1960, Dwork provided a brief detour by usingp-adic analy - sistures: that is, the rationality and the functional equa-[III.51](/part - 03/local - and - global - in - number - theory) to prove parts (i) and (iii) of the conjection.
Shortly there after, building on comments of Serre and in collaboration with Artin, Grothendieck proposed V. Theorems and Problems and developed a candidate for a Weil cohomology, theétale cohomology. Indeed, he noted that one could in fact extend the list of desired properties of a weil cohomology in such a way that the Weil conjectures would follow almost immediately.
These properties were known but extremely difficult in the classical case, and included the “hard Lefschetz theorem.” In a burst of optimism, Grothendieck referred to them as the “standard conjectures,” and envisioned that the weil conjectures would ultimately be proved through them. entirely according to Grothendieck’s plan. His stu-dent Deligne set about working on the problem, and However, the final chapter of the story did not go was ultimately able to complete an exceedingly sub-tle and intricate proof using induction on the dimension of the variety.
The étale cohomology played an absolutely fundamental role in Deligne’s proof, but he also introduced other ideas into the picture, most notably a classical geometric construction of Lefschetz, as well as some work of Rankin on the Ramanu-jan conjecture. In the end, he was able to conclude the hard Lefschetz theorem from his work, but the rest of the standard conjectures remain unsolved to this day. Acknowledgments.

incommensurabil ity; theorem of Pythagoras One of the most elusive figures of antiquity, Pythagoras is famous not just for his alleged mathematical achievements: it has been claimed that he had a golden thigh and that he issued a prescription against broadbeans. Few things about him can be taken as historical facts, but we can be reasonably confident that he lived in around the sixth century b.c.e. in Greek southern Italy and that he established a group of follow - ers, the Pythagoreans, who shared not just beliefs, but also dietary habits and a code of behavior.
The exis-tence of anecdotes about splinter Pythagoreans who revealed secrets to outsiders and were accordingly pun-ished suggests that they were far from constituting a completely homogeneous group. After a peak period in the late fifth century b.c.e., the Pythagoreans dispersed, probably as a result of their involvement in the public life of various city - states. The impact of their theories about the universe and the soul was very long - lived, though, and can be felt in Plato, Aristotle, and later authors. From the third century was produced that purported to be by Pythagoras orb.c.e.
until well into late antiquity, a stream of texts his immediate successors. Indeed, historians talk of a neo-Pythagorean philosophical movement, some times associated with neo - Platonism. commonly linked to the theorem establishing that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle The name of Pythagoras and his school is most is equivalent to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. In fact, there is some evidence that the mathematical property expressed by the theorem was known in Mesopotamia long before Pythagoras’s time;
the ancient sources attributing the result to him are late and not entirely reliable, and no actual proof of Part VI the theorem is found before Euclid’sthe proof itself may predate euclid [VI.2](/part - 06/euclid - ca), there is no Elements. While solid reason to connect it to Pythagoras. Similarly, the discovery of the incommensurabil ity of the side and the diagonal of a square, often attributed to Pythagoreans, may have been made earlier in Mesopotamia, and the earliest full proof in a Greek context belongs to a later period. Pythagoras’s real contribution to mathematics lies elsewhere.
The Pythagoreans are credited by Aristo-tle with the theory that “things themselves are numbers.” One interpretation is that they believed that mathematics offered a key to understanding reality, whether this reality was conceived to have an underlying geometrical structure (as in Plato’swh et her it was simply seen as ordered and “in propor - Timaeus), or tion.” Indeed, Pythagoreans are plausibly credited witha strong interest in formulating the numerical ratios of musical concords and harmony.
They connected the harmonious sound produced by, say, the plucking ofa string with the fact that the musician plucked it at specific, mathematically expressible points. Breaking the mathematical proportion between the points on the string unsettled the sound produced. The heavenly bodies themselves, according to the Pythagoreans, pro-duced music, thanks to their mathematical, and therefore orderly, arrangement. Understand the mathemat - ics, and you will grasp the structure of reality: this insight is perhaps Pythagoras’s true legacy. Further Reading Burkert, W. 1972.anism. Cambridge, MA:

In fact, his major work, the collection, with no strong authorial voice and no clear Elements, is now seen as a rather loose way of determining what, if any, Euclid’s original contri-but i ons were. Born in the cultural climate of Ptolemaic Alexandria, the text probably aimed at systematizing the current knowledge in some mathematical areas.
squaring of any rectilinear figure, the bisection of anarc, the inscription and circumscription of polygons The Elements covers plane geometry (including the in circles, the finding of a mean proportional), solid geometry (e.g., the ratio of spheres to one another, the five regular solids), and arithmetic, from relatively simple (the properties of odd and even numbers, prime number theory) to more complex (commensurable and incommensurable lines, binomials and apotomes).The title hints at the foundational character of the text, which starts with definitions of mathematical objects (e.g.,
point, straight line, scalene triangle), postulates (e.g., all right angles are equal to one another)and common notions (e.g., the whole is greater than the part). These initial premises are not demonstrated—whether some postulates are demonstrable spawned debate in antiquity, and later led to non-euclidean geometries. In a style which has been termed axiomatic deductive, proofs tend to be general rather than spe - cific;
they use a restricted set of formulaic expressions, refer to a lettered diagram, and each of their steps is justified by appeal to undemonstrated premises, to previous proofs, or to very simple notions, such asthe principle of the excluded middle. Some proofs use reductio ad absurdum something is the case, they proceed to show that any: instead of directly showing that alternative is impossible. There are parts of the book that reveal the presence of different, less abstract, demonstrative procedures.
For instance, one of the theorems establishing crite-ria for two triangles to have the same area refers to one triangle being “superimposed” on the other, with the reader effectively invited to verify that their areas are indeed equal. The appeal is to a mental opera - tion, which is quite different from the logical step-bystep method found elsewhere. Again, book IX contains propositions on odd and even numbers, which are often seen as vestiges of Pythagorean mathematics, to be VI. Mathematicians demonstrated with the help of pebbles.
The coexistence itself of arithmetic and geometry has been puzzling for some historians, who have proposed a notion of“geometric algebra,” so that book II, ostensibly about squares and rectangles built on segments of straight lines, would in fact foreshadow modern equations. As well as works on astronomy, optics, and music, the lems on the basis of some elements that are already Data, which is about solving geometrical prob given, is also attributed to Euclid. His fame is, however, inextricably linked to the Elements.
The very absence of a strong authorial voice has perhaps facilitated other mathematicians’ interaction with the text, which has been appropriated, added to, interfered with, and commented upon since antiquity. This very plasticity helped to make it possibly the most popular mathe-mat ical book of all time.

Siracusa, Magna Graecia (now Syracuse, Italy), ca. 287 d. Siracusa, 212 b.c.e. b.c.e.; Area of the circle; centers of gravity; method of exhaustion; volume of the sphere Archimedes’ life was as spectacular as his scientific achievements: various sources attest that he built a ship, a cosmological model, and magnificent catapults with which he defended his native Syracuse during the Second Punic War.
The Roman besiegers eventually took the city by deceit, and Archimedes was killed in the ensuing pillage. According to legend, his tomb was engraved with a sphere inscribed in a cylinder, to mark one of his most famous discoveries. Indeed, the first part of his Sphere and Cylinder reaches a climax with a proof that the volume of every sphere is two thirds of that of the cylinder circumscribing it. Archimedes’interest in establishing the volume or area of curved figures is also attested by his discovery of the area of the VI.4.
Apollonius circle and of a sphere, and by treatises on spiral curves, conoids, and paraboloids, and on the Quadrature of the Parabola. Archimedes’ style is distinctive. Many of his theorems about curved figures use the so-called While following an axiomatic-deductive framework, method of exhaustion Take the problem of determining the area of a circle.[II.6 §2](/part - 02/idea - of - proof). Archimedes accomplished this by showing that it hadthe same area as that of a certain right-angled triangle.
Since it was known how to calculate the area of a triangle, he was “reducing” a problem whose solution was unknown to one whose solution was known. Rather than establishing this directly, he proves that the areaof the circle can be neither larger than nor smaller than the area of the triangle, so that only one possi-bility remains: that they are equal. This is achieved, here and in general, by inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures to the curvilinear figure under inves - ti gation, thus getting closer and closer to it.
The leap from closer and closer approximation to equivalence of a rectilinear and curvilinear figure, however, can be accomplished only indirectly, by excluding the other possibilities. Such arguments usually employ a lemma, already found in Euclid, to the effect that if we start with a quantity and replace it by a quantity at most half as large, and then repeat this, then what remains can be made as small as we please.
onerthe centers of gravity of plane figures and on bodies Archimedes’ output also includes, about astronomy and arithmetic, and works on The Sand-Re ck immersed in a fluid. Above all, Archimedes provides unique insights into the processes of ancient Greek mathematics. The sec-ond part of Sphere and Cylinder contains problems about constructing given solid bodies. Several of the proofs are in two parts: analysis and synthesis.
In the analysis, the result one wants to establish is taken as proved, and consequences are drawn from it, until one hits upon a result that is already proved elsewhere, and the process is then reconstituted in reverse (the “syn - thesis”). The recently rediscovered Method (addressed to Eratosthenes) reveals that Archimedes arrived at some of his most famous results, e.g., the area of a segment of a parabola, by imagining the two objects involved (say, a segment of a parabola and a triangle)as divided up into an infinite number of slices and lines, then placed at the two ends of a balance and
set in equilibrium with each other. Archimedes underlined that this heuristic procedure was not a strict proof, but that 735 only makes the into the mind of a great mathematician.

The letters prefac-ing six of the surviving books indicate that he was a highly esteemed member of a network of mathemat i - cians, to whom he sent his results. He refers to the fact that various versions of his Conics were circulated, the latest probably incorporating his correspondents’ feed - back.
Knowledge of the parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse predates Apollonius (we find conics in Archimedes), but his is the first known systematic account of these curves, which were of interest both in themselves and because they could be used as auxiliary lines for the solution of problems such as the trisection of an angle or the duplication of the cube. Apollonius himself declares that the first four books of the indeed he starts with definitions of the cone and its Conics are an introduction to the subject, and various parts.
The parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse arenot introduced until later, so that their origin (from a plane cutting a cone or a conic surface at differ-ent angles) is already accompanied by a statement of their properties, which are further and fully exploredin the next three books. These include theorems on tangents, asymptotes, and axes; constructions of conic sections on the basis of certain data; and an account of the conditions under which conics can intersect in the same plane.
contain treatments of maximum and minimum lines The nonelementary books, which exist only in Arabic, 736 within the sections, the construction of conic sections equal or similar to a given conic section (including the theorem that all parabolas are similar), and “diorismic theorems.” These are propositions that set the limits of possibility of a construction, or the limits of valid-ity of some property of a geometrical configuration, given a certain number of known positions or known objects at the outset.
Indeed, several of the propositions in the fig ur at i ons consisting of all the points sharing a certain Conics are about loci, i.e., geometrical con family of properties. Apollonius criticizes for not having provided an exhaustive solution to the euclid [VI.2](/part - 06/euclid - ca) construction of the three-line and four-line locus (con-figurations of three or four lines, arranged so that they have specific properties).In terms of demonstrative methods, Apollonius is in the axiomatic-deductive mold:
general enunciations, lettered diagrams, each step justified by appeal to undemonstrated premises or previous proofs. Instead of in direct methods, we find a real mastery of the intri-cacies (and power) of proportion theory. At the same time, his propositions easily lend themselves to the consider at i on of different subcases: when, for instance, a certain line falls inside, out side, or on the vertex of a conical surface.
Apollonius, in other words, combines a systematic approach with an almost playful fascination with exploring the possibilities of mathematical objects and their properties under varying circumstances.

It con-tained many new ideas, including methods (not all Cardano’s own) for solving cubic and quartic equations, all written with out mathematical notation. Cardano’s own great insight was to recognize the existence ofrelations between the roots and the coefficients of an equation; in this he was unprecedented.
He also showed a greater readiness than most of his contemporaries to contemplate the square roots of negative numbers. He is remembered today for “Cardano’s rule” for solving cubic equations of the form$x3 + cx = d$, where

Above all, the Algebra was renowned for solving certain special cases of the so-called casus irreducibilis of the cubic, those in which Cardano’s rule appears to give rise to a complex or “impossible” solution.
Cardano was aware that what we today call complex numbers (num-bers of the forma + b. qrt{-1}) could arise in the solution of quadratic equations. Bombelli made the important discovery that what at first sight appears to be a complex root of a cubic equation may in fact be a real root, because the imaginary parts cancel each other out.

geometry with algebraic methods that had originated from Islamic sources, and in doing so laid the foundations for the algebraic approach to geometry. Viète saw that the symbols in equations (traditionally variants of R, Q, and C, for the unknown, its square, and its cube) could represent either numbers or geometric quanti-ties, and that this was potentially a powerful tool for analyzing and solving geometric problems.
reading of the fourth century Viète’s understanding of analysis was based on his Synagogec.e.), where analysis was described as(“Collection”) of Pappus (early a method of investigating a problem by assuming that the solution is in some sense known, as we would do now by representing the solution by a symbol and car-rying out mathematical manipulations involving that symbol. Algebra achieves this by regarding all quan-tities, known or unknown, as of equal status;
equations are then formed from prestated conditions (a process Viète called unknown quantity in terms of those given (zetetics), and solved to produce the exegetics). For Viète the final step in geometric problems was to provide a specific construction for the solution: this was the geometric synthesis arising from the preceding algebraic In several further treatises, mostly written or pub-analysis.

For most of the seventeenth century, algebra continued tobe known as the “analytic art,” or simply “analysis.” algebraically, Viète also put forward a method ofnumerical solution based on successive approxima-Recognizing that not all equations could be solved tions. This was the first appearance of such techniques in Europe, and was important not only for practical purposes, but also because it rapidly led to a deeper understanding of the relationships between roots and coefficients of equations.

It remained his only mathematical public a-Discours de la tion. No single early modern text shaped the devel-opment of mathematics between 1650 and 1700 as strongly asanalytic geometry and it paved the way for the merging La Géométrie.
It was the founding text of of algebra and geometry that made possible the devel-opment of the integral and differential calculus about fifty years later. Descartes was educated at the Jesuit College at La Flèche. He spent his life mostly out side France, travel-ing through Europe in his early twenties and living in the Netherlands from 1628 until 1649; he then left for Sweden, invited by Queen Christina to her court. From an early age his interest in mathematics was tightly linked to his primary philosophical preoccupation: the certainty of knowledge.
In a letter of 1619 he sketched a method, clearly inspired by arithmetic and geometry, for solving all problems in natural philosophy. shortly afterward, his ideas grew into a passionate conviction that he could and should develop a philosophy along these problem-solving and mathematics-inspired lines.

Descartes offered little in the way of general principles, explaining his ideas by means of examples. Descartes used a classical problem, Pappus’s problem, in order to explain coordinates and equations of curves, and showed that the defining property of a curve could be written as an equation. He introduced coordinate sx and y, using oblique as well as rectan- gular coordinate axes, which he always adjusted to the problem at hand. He also introduced the now very common usage of employinga, b, and cfor indeterminate fixed quantities.x, y , and z for unknowns and metrical answer.
The equation was at best an algebraic reformulation of the problem; the answer had to be a For Descartes, a geometrical problem required a geo construction of the curve or of individual points. If, asin the particular case of Pappus’s problem in four lines, the equation was quadratic, then for any fixed value of y Earlier in the book Descartes had shown how such athe x-coordinate was a root of a quadratic equation.

Rather, its aim was to problems, and to do so Descartes had to answer two urgent methodological questions.
The first was how to solve geometrical problems not constructible by ruler and compass, and the second was how to use algebra as an analytic, i.e., solution-finding, tool in geometry. For the first of these, Descartes allowed successively more complicated curves as means of construction.
Itwas Descartes’s conviction that algebra, through the equations of these curves, could guide him to choose, among all such construction curves, the most appropriate for the problem, in particular the simplest, i.e., that of lowest degree. The second question addressed serious conceptual difficulties that were felt at the time about using alge-bra in geometry. The transfer of algebraic operations to geometry was indeed problematic because multiplication in geometry was generally interpreted dimen-sion ally:
for example, a product of two lengths had to represent an area, and a product of three a volume. But until then algebra had dealt mostly with numbers and had routinely used products of more than three factors. Thus, a consistent and unrestricted geomet-rical interpretation of the operations of algebra was needed. Descartes did indeed provide such a re inter-pretation. He introduced a unit line segment in such a way that multiplication no longer raised the dimension and in homogeneous terms could be allowed inequations. link philosophy and mathematics.

with sufficient clarity to be acceptable in geometry. His answer was that all algebraic curves were acceptable (he called these “geometrical curves”) and all others were not (these he called “mechanical”). Few seventeenth century mathematicians followed Descartes in this strict demarcation of geometry. This is typical of the reception of Descartes’s La Géométrie: the philosophical and methodological aspects of the book were largely ignored by his mathematical readers, but the technical mathematical aspects were eagerly accepted and used.

Viète and other algebraists before him had used equations in a single unknown A crucial early-modern topic was the use of algebra to to rewrite and solve “determinate” problems (prob-lems admitting a finite number of solutions).
In his manuscript circulated in Paris in 1637 (the same year as Descartes’s Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge, which La Géométriedling and solving indeterminate problems associated), Fermat presented a general way of han with constructions of loci: that is, of sets of points (usu-ally curves) defined by some constraints. He identified

VI.13. Blaise Pascal

the points of such loci by two coordinates linked by anequation (although he chose a different way of taking coordinates from the usual modernx and y coordin- ates). More over, Fermat gave the standard forms of the corresponding equation when the locus to be found was a line, a parabola, an ellipse, etc. Fermat also used algebraic analysis to solve problems of extrema, including finding the tangent or the normal to a curve at a given point, and determining centers of gravity.
His method relies on the principle that a certain algebraic expression takes on the same values twice near the extremum.
Although the procedure is purely algebraic, his successors tended to interpret it from a differential perspective, there by making his work an apparent precursor of the calculus. Fermat applied the method to a variety of problems, includ-ing (within the framework of a controversy with Descartes’s followers around 1660) a proof of the law of refraction in optics. Basing his analysis on the principle that “nature acts in the shortest time,” Fermat was able to express the problem as one of extrema and to solve itwith his method.
The problem of refraction was one of the first complex physical problems to be treated in a thoroughly mathematical way, and Fermat’s approach later led to variational methods [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). more classical, for instance Archimedean, techniques, which he used when dealing with other types of geo - However, Fermat also showed a perfect mastery of metrical questions such as quadrature. Such versatility also appears in Fermat’s work on numbers.
On the one hand, he was happy to apply his algebraic approach to Diophantine analysis in order to obtain solutions for cases previously thought to be in soluble, or to derive new solutions from ones already known. On the other hand, he advocated a theoretical study of the integers, for which the currently available algebraic theory of equations was not sufficient. For example, he gave general properties of the divisors of numbers of the forman ± 1 (among them his now cel- ebr at ed various Nlittle theorem.
He invented the method of infinite descent[III.58](/part - 03/modular - arithmetic)) and of x2 + Ny2 for specifically to deal with problems concerning integers. He used this method, which relies on the impossibility of constructing an infinite strictly decreasing sequenceof integers, to prove that$a^{4} - b^{4} = c^{2} \text{has no nontrivial}$ integer solutions.
This is a particular case of his famous last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem), which Fermat only stated in the margins of one of his books:$a^{n} + b^{n} = c^{n} \text{has no non}-$ trivial integer solutions for general case was given by Andrew Wiles in 1995. n >2.

From Descartes, Newton learned how useful it could be to relate algebra to geom-etry, since plane curves could be represented by algebraic equations in two unknowns.
Descartes had, however, imposed strict limitations on the class of curves allowed in La Géométrie: “geometrical” (i.e., algebraic) curves were admitted but “mechanical” (i.e., transcendental) ones were not. In common with many of his con-temporaries, Newton felt that such limitations ought to be over come and that a “new analysis” capable of dealing with mechanical curves ought to be possible.

A few months later, Newton, with extraordinary inproblems in which one is required to find the tangent to a curve, and problems in which one is required to find the area subtended by a curve. He conceived geometrical magnitudes as being generated by continuous motion.
For example, the motion of a point generates a line and the motion of a line generates a surface. These he called “fluents,” while the instantaneous rate of flow he called the “fluxion.” Basing his intuitions on kinematical models, he formulated a version of what is known today asculus [I.3 §5.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). Namely, he proved that tangent andthe fundamental theorem of calarea problems are inverses of each other.
In modern terms, Newton was able to reduce quadrature problems (i.e., calculating curvilinear areas) to the search for primitive functions (indefinite integrals). He built “catalogues of curves” (tables of integrals), deploying tech-niques equivalent to substitution of variables and integration by parts. He developed an efficient algorithm that allowed him to tackle both the direct (differential) and inverse (integral) methods of fluxions.
He was able to calculate the tangent to and curvature of any known curve, and perform integrations of many classes of (what we now call) ordinary differential equations. Such VI.15.

His Arithmetica Universalis, the text in which he collected together his lectures on algebra, appeared in 1707.Before 1704, Newton, displaying his characteristic reluctance to publish, had divulged his discoveries onthe fluxional method through letters and manuscripts rather than in printed form. In the meantime leibniz also discovered the differential and integral calculus,[VI.15](/part - 06/gottfried - wilhelm - leibniz - 16461716), later than Newton but independently, had and had printed it as early as 1684–86.
Newton was convinced that Leibniz had stolen the idea from him, and from 1699 onward he engaged Leibniz in a bitter quarrel over priority. In the early 1670 s Newton began distancing himself from the modern symbolic style that had characterized his youthful researches. He turned to geometry in the hope of restoring a hidden geometric method of discovery: the “method of analysis,” known to the ancient Greeks. In fact, geometry dominates Newton’s masterpiece, theica. In this work, which appeared in 1687, Newton pre-Philosophiae Natural is Principia Mathemat sent ed his theory of gravitation.
Newton was convinced that the ancient method was superior to the modern symbolic one that he identified with Cartesian analysis. In his attempts to rediscover the method, he developed elements of projective geometry.

In1676 he became counselor and librarian in Hanover for the Duke Johann Friedrich of Braunschweig–Lüneburg, holding this position until the end of his life. Be sides mathematics he occupied himself with technical, his-tor io graphical, political, religious, and philosophical questions.
His philosophy distinguished between two are as of reality: the world of appearances and the world of substances. It was in developing his philosophy thathe was led to declare that the real world is “the best of all possible worlds.” In 1700 he was appointed first president of the newly founded Brandenburg Society of Sciences established in Berlin.

Most of his mathematical ideas and writings were About a fifth of his mathematical papers have now been published. He was always more interested in general or even universal methods than in technical details, using analogy and inductive reasoning to develop the art ofinvention. For the same reason he became a key creator of mathematical notation: he knew how much a suitable notation could facilitate mathematical discoveries.
treatise on infinitesimal geometry (written in 1675–76 but not published until 1993). In it he used his “quanta”One of Leibniz’s earliest mathematical works was a concept of the infinite. In Leibniz’s eyes the actual infi-nite as well as indivisibles, in the strictest sense of the word, were not quantities and therefore not mathemat i-cal entities: hence, he used the notions “infinitely small” and “infinitely large.” These denoted, it is true, variable quantities, but nevertheless they were quantities of a sort, so they could be handled by mathematics.
Among the results in this treatise is a rigorous proof, in the style of archimedes [VI.3](/part-06/archimedes-ca), of the existence of (what is today known as) the continuous functions, which is based on intermediary riemann integral [I.3 §5.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) of values of the function within subintervals. Only a fewof these results were actually published by Leibniz, and even these mainly with out proof: in 1682 the alternat-ing series for$π/$4; in 1691 some further results.
In 1713 he communicated his alternating series test in a private letter to johann bernoulli [VI.18](/part - 06/the - bernoullis-). VI. Mathematicians invented his version of the differential and integral cal-The year 1675 was also the year in which Leibniz culus, although its publication did not begin until 1684.His calculus was based on the key concept of a variable (quantity) ranging over a sequence of values infinitely close to each other, with the differential, the difference between two successive values in the sequence, being itself a variable that could be manipulated in the usual
manner. Differentiation was represented by the opera - tor “d”, which assigned variables to variables. For example, if short line, also of variable length. Integration meantx is a line of variable length, then dx is a very summation. His notation (d and deduced the standard differentiation rules (the chain) is still used today. He rule, the product rule, etc.) and successfully applied his calculus to the differentiation of families of curves, to differentiation under the integral sign, and to various types of differential equations.
Leibniz considered “combinatorial art” as a general qualitative science, which did not coincide with mod-ern combinatorial analysis but included combinatorics and algebra: Leibniz considered it as “the inventive partof logic.” Here he found the Girard formula for the representation of sums of powers of roots of equations by means of elementary symmetric functions, and the so called Waring formulas by which polynomial symmet-ric functions are reduced to power sums (these were rediscovered by double and multiple indices in order to solve systems waring [VI.21](/part - 06/edward - waring - ca) in
1762). He invented of linear equations and problems of elimination theory. Between 1678 and 1713 he laid the foundations for the theory of known as Cramer’s rule, for solving simultaneous equa - determinants [III.15](/part - 03/determinants). The method now tions, which in modern terms is based on determi - nants, and which Cramer published in 1750, was in fact found in 1684 by Leibniz (but again not published byhim).
He also stated (with out proof) several theorems in the theory of linear equations and elimination theory now attributed to euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783), laplace [VI.23](/part - 06/pierre - simon - laplace - 17491827), and sylvester [VI.42](/part - 06/james - joseph - sylvester - 18141897). Among Leibniz’s other mathematical interests was additive number theory. In 1673 he found a recursion formula for the number of tripartitions of a natural number (published in 1976) and discovered further rules of recurrence now attributed to Euler.
He also developed a formalism for a positional calculus (culus situs) in order to express positions in space: if cal the definitions of figures are completely expressed bythis calculus, all of their properties can then be found VI.18.

He conceived of a general science: that is, of an art of inventing and of judging all sciences by means of sufficient data and a suitable universal language or writing. Yet, his “characteristic a universalis” and the ensuing logical calculi remained fragmentary projects.
His “calculus ratiocinator” was meant to be a formalized deduction of truth. Given that Leibniz was interested in formalizing calculations, it is not surprising that he also constructed the first four-function calculating machine. In constructing this machine he invented a new technical device, which he developed in two different versions: the so-called pinwheel (before 1676) and the stepped drum (from1693 or earlier).

London, 1731 Secretary of the Royal Society (1714–18) Taylor was not the first to discover the theorem that bears his name (James Gregory found the theorem in 1671), but he was the first to publish it and the first to appreciate its significance and applicability. The theorem, which states that any function that satisfies cer-tain conditions can be expressed as (what is now known as) a Taylor series, was published in Taylor’sdus Incrementorum Direct a et In versa (1715).
In the Metho Methodus Taylor gave the series as$f (x) f (x) f \sum (x)f (x + h) = f (x)+$1!$h+$2!$h^{2}+$3! h3+· · · (as it would appear in modern notation). Although Tay-lor did not attend to questions of rigor—there is no consider at i on of convergence, of the remainder term, or of the validity of expressing a function by such a series—his derivation of the series was not out of line

with the standards of its day. Taylor used the theorem for approximating the roots of equations and for solving differential equations. Although he was aware of its use for expanding functions into series, he does not appear to have fully appreciated its significance in this respect. lem of the vibrating string (discussed in theand in earlier papers) and for a book on the theory of Taylor is also noted for his contribution to the prob-Methodus linear perspective (1715).

This was first stated by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in 1742 in a letter to Goldbach in response to the earlier proposal by Goldbach that every number greater than 2 is a sum of three primes (Goldbach considered1 as a prime number). Goldbach’s conjecture, together with the weaker conjecture that every odd number is either prime or the sum of three primes, was first published bytion. Both conjectures remain unsolved.

The Bernoullis played a remarkable role in the develop-ment of mathematics during the Enlightenment. Indeed

such was the family’s importance that in 1715[VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) coined the term “bernoullizare” to describe the leibniz activity of doing mathematics. Altogether eight members of the family devoted themselves to the mathe-mat ical sciences (including physics, especially mechanics and fluid mechanics), and from 1687 to 1790 the mathematics chair of the university of Basel was occupied by successive members of the family: first Jacob (1687–1705), then his brother Johann (1705–48), and finally Johann’s son, Johann II (1748–90).
Through out the eighteenth century Bernoullis were members of the Paris Academy of Sciences and individually they won prestigious prizes on many occasions. The same was true of the academies in Berlin, Saint Petersburg, and several others. who fled the Spanish Netherlands. The first Bernoullito settle in Basel was Jacob, a druggist, who became The family goes back to a line of Calvinist merchants a citizen in 1622. His grandson, Jacob I, studied phi-losophy and theology in Basel before turning to mathematics, against the will of his father. This was to bea typical pattern in the family:
many of the Bernoullis studied mathematics despite pressure from the family to make a career in other areas (such as medicineor law). Having received a licentiate in theology in 1676, Jacob under took an educational journey which took him first to France, then to the Netherlands, and finally to England. And it was through his encounters with Nicolas Malebranche, Jan Hudde, and others that he became acquainted with Cartesianism and its most eminent representatives. In 1677 he started his diary, Meditationes, in which he wrote down many of his mathematical insights and thoughts.
Jacob studied Leibniz’s early memoirs on differential calculus, whose power he was the first, together with Having obtained the chair of mathematics in Basel, his younger brother Johann I, to recognize. In a paper on the curve of constant descent, published in the Leipzig to use the term “integral” in its present mathemat-Acta Eruditorum in 1690, Jacob was the first ical sense.
From then on he showed his mastery of Leibnizian methods in his study of curves, including, among others, the catenary, the form of a bent elastic beam, the form of a sail inflated by the wind, and the parabolic and logarithmic spirals. He also solved the differential equation$y = p(x)y + q(x)yn$, which is now named after him. However he is best remembered for his Ars Conjectandi (1713), which was published posthumously with a short foreword by his nephew, Nicolaus I. It contains an attempt to give a sound math - VI.
Mathematicians ematical treatment of a commonsense principle already appealed to by cardano [VI.7](/part - 06/girolamo - cardano - 15011576) and Halley: if an experiment is repeated a large number of times, then the rela-tive frequency with which an event occurs will roughly equal the probability of the event.

Jacob computed these numbers up to B10. Johann, who had to study medicine before he could devote himself to mathematics, got his first mathe-mat ical training from his brother Jacob, with whom he developed numerous applications of the new Leib-nizian calculus to mechanics.
An academic peregrination brought him to Paris in 1691–92, where he gave private lessons to Guillaume de l’Hôpital. These lessons are the basis of l’Hôpital’s famous Analyse des Infiniment Petits lus, contains l’Hôpital’s rule, which Johann had com-(1696).

They engaged in heated struggles concerning the solution of the brachistochrone (curve of fastest descent)problem, and a complicated isoperimetric problem that involved minimizing the area enclosed by a curve of fixed length. Eventually, these bitter quarrels led to an interesting mathematical out come: the creation of the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods).
After Jacob’s death, Johann took over the mathematics chair in Basel, where he taught until the end of his life, attracting students from all over Europe, including euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783). Johann’s most important achievement in mathematics is the development of the integral calculus. He devel-oped a general theory for the integration of rational functions and new methods for the solution of dif-ferential equations. He also extended the infinitesimal calculus to handle exponential functions [III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions).

With each camp defying the other with difficult problems, Johann had the opportunity to create, with his son Nicolaus II, the theory of orthogonal trajectories of fami-lies of curves.
Johann was also a towering figure in the origins of analytical mechanics and in mathematical physics, where, among other things, he made not able contributions to the study of central forces, to navigational theories, and to the question of the principles of statics. Basel with his uncle Jacob before taking a degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence (1709). He was the professor Nicolaus I studied mathematics at the university of of mathematics in Padua, occupying the chair once heldby Galileo, and he later held the professorship of logic in Basel.
His main interests in mathematics were infi-nite series and the applications of probability theory to questions of law. He formulated, in 1713, the notorious Saint Petersburg paradox, which originated witha gambling game. Suppose that Peter is tossing a fair coin, and he will give Paul one ducat if the coin turns up heads on the first toss, two ducats if it shows heads for the first time on the second toss, and in general 2 n - 1 ducats if the coin turns up heads for the first time onthenth toss.
The standard calculation shows that the value of Paul’s expectation (1 2 n - 1 +· · ·) is infinitely great. Nevertheless no “fairly E =1 21 +1 42 +1 84 + · · · +reasonable man” would be willing to pay even a moder-2 n ately high price to purchase Paul’s prospects. The result of the mathematical analysis clearly affronted common sense; this was the paradox. Nicolaus’s cousin, Daniel, discussed the problem while he was staying in Saint Petersburg (hence the name given to the paradox). His strategy was to distinguish two senses of expectation, one mathematical and the other moral.
The latter was to take into account the individual characteristics ofthe risk taker (his wealth, for instance).

Much of Euler’s best work involved series.
His first widely acclaimed result was when he solved one of the best-known problems of his age, the seventy - year - old “Basel problem.” The problem was to evaluate the sumof the reciprocals of the square integers$, orζ(2)$. Euler showed that

He became well-known as the scientific editor of the celebrated French eight-volume work on which he collaborated with Denis Encyclopédie, the twenty Diderot, and for which he wrote most of the mathemat-ical and many of the scientific articles.

Disgusted with the permanent climate of controversy and the end less metaphysical discussions among his Jansenist teach - ers, d’Alembert decided, after attaining his diploma 750 in law, to devote himself to his personal passion,“géométrie” (that is, mathematics).
D’Alembert’s first communications to the French Académie were concerned with the analytic geometryof curves, the integral calculus, and fluid resistance, notably the problem of the deceleration and deflec-tion of a disk entering a fluid, which was linked to the Cartesian explanation of refraction of light. He made a close reading of ment ary on passages of the first book showing his clear newton’s [VI.14](/part - 06/isaac - newton - 16421727) Principia, his com preference for analytical methods over the synthetic geometry of Newton.
D’Alembert’s Traité de Dynamique (1743) made him famous in learned circles. He built up a systematic and rigorous theory of mechanics founded upon a short list of well-chosen principles—inertia, composition of motions (i.e., the addition of the effects of two forces or powers), and equilibrium—while at the same time trying to avoid metaphysical arguments.
Most notably heproposed an important general principle, known today as “d’Alembert’s principle,” to simplify the investiga-tion of constrained systems, such as the compound pendulum, vibrating rods, strings, rotating bodies, and even fluids, which he considered to be aggregates ofparallel slices. The essential idea behind the principle was to reduce a problem in dynamics to one in statics, roughly speaking by introducing a fictitious force, the “kinetic reaction,” which was minus the mass times the acceleration.
This allowed techniques from statics to be brought to bear on problems in dynamics.

He proved that, for a real polynomial, imaginary roots always occur in conjugate pairs, and that even if a real polynomial has no real root, there is still always a complex root.

In 1747 d’Alembert dis-cussed various possibilities for solving the problem— an additional force, or a very irregular shape for the Moon, or some vortices between Earth and Moon—and produced a long study on celestial mechanics and planetary perturbations that has only recently been redis-covered and published (see d’Alembert 2002).
By 1749 an improved mathematical analysis of the problem had shown that Newton’s theory was correct. The rest of d’Alembert’s extensive work on celestial mechanics was published in hisÉquinoxes (1749), Recherches sur Différents Points du Recherches sur la Précession des Système du Monde volumes of his Opuscules(1754–56), and in some of the eight(1761–83). problem of vibrating strings, que Forme une Corde Tendue Mise en Vibration In 1747 d’Alembert presented a paper on the famous Recherches sur la Courbe(1749).

This is a typical example of Lagrange’s reductionist style. Through out his career he sought suitable for-malisms with which to express and solve the key problems of mathematical analysis. Lagrange publicly presented hisδ-formalism in a memoir published in the second volume (1760–61) of Miscellanea Taurinensia, a review he had helped to found. He coupled this memoir with another in which he used the same formalism to formulate a generalized version of the principle of least action (previously intro-duced by Maupertuis and Euler).
As a result, he was able to derive the equations of motion of any system of dis-tinct bodies attracted by central forces depending on the distances from their centers. ne ns i a sent ing a new approach to the problem of the vibrating Meanwhile, in the first volume of(1759), Lagrange had published a memoir pre-Miscellanea Tauristring, where the string is first represented as a dis-crete system ofn particles, and n is then allowed to tend to infinity.
Using this method Lagrange argued that Euler was right to allow a large class of “func-tions,” both “continuous” and “discontinuous,” as solutions of this problem, where as maintained that only “continuous functions” (that is, d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) had curves expressed by a single equation) could count assolutions.

It was based on the interpretation of a continuous Lagrange established a very general program in the system as a limiting case of a discrete one and theuse of the method of indeterminate coefficients: supposing that fic i en ts a (i P (x)= 0, . . . , nis a polynomial in) depend on some indetermi-x, whose coef-i

nates, and that P (x) = 0 for all x (in a given interval), this method consists of deducing the system of equa-tions${a = 0}^{i} = n$, from which the indeterminates are possibly determined. Lagrange extended this method to sums of polynomials in several (independent) vari-$i^{i} = 0$ ables, and (following Euler, d’Alembert, and many oth-ers) also used it with respect to power series. This program was further elaborated in two memoirs on the motion of the Moon (1764, 1780), and later realized in the Méchanique Analitique (1788). Here, the principle

of least action was replaced by a generalization of the Bernoullian principle of “virtual velocities,” which were expressed by variations. Using what are now known as generalized coordinates,φ (that is, mutually indepen-i

His methods were further developed by laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) in his Mécanique Céleste and formed the basis for subsequent mathematical work in physical astronomy. The method of indeterminate coefficients, or rather its extension to power series, is also the crucial tech-nique underlying Lagrange’s approach to the calculus.
In a memoir which appeared in the Berlin Academy (1768) he used it to prove an important Proceedings of the result connecting the calculus to the theory of algebraic equations, the so-called Lagrange in version theorem, which states that a functionψ(p) of a root p of an equationt - x + φ(x) = 0, where φ(x) is an arbitrary function of Taylor expansions ofx, can be expanded in a series based on theφ(t) and ψ(t) (the precise con- ditions to be satisfied byclarified by cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and Roché).x, φ(x), and ψ(t) were later series and proved that if a

In tions Analytiques (1797) he then showed (or, rather, Théorie des Fonc claimed to have shown), with out making an appeal tothe differential calculus, that any function$f (x + h) can$ be expanded in a power series, and suggested inter-preting the differential formalism as a formalism that applies to the coefficients of$h^{i}/i$! in such an expansion.
In other words, he suggested defining the differential ratios of any order (that is, the ratios d$iy/dx^{i}$, wherey = f (x)) as derivative functions supplying these coef- ficients, where as previously these had been thought ofas genuine ratios of differentials. He also proved that the remainder of a Taylor series could be written in the form now known as the Lagrange remainder.

least-squares rule of error by means of a linear regres-sion, and the laplacian [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or potential function. Laplace developed the fields of celestial mechanics (the phrase was his coinage) and probability, and along theway the mathematics to service and advance them. For Laplace, celestial mechanics and probability were com-ple ment ary instruments that implemented a unified vision of a fully determined universe. Celestial mechanics vindicated the Newtonian system of the world.
Prob-ability was the measure, not of the operations of chance in nature, for there are none, but of human ignoranceof causes, which was to be reduced to virtual certainty by calculation. The third reason for Laplace’s importance to the history of science was the mathematiza-tion of physics in the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Apart from a few formulations—speed of sound, capillary action, refractive indices of gases— his role there was that of instigator and patron rather than of major contributor.
Laplace came up with the majority of the above concepts in a probabilistic context.
 The earliest hints ofthe method of solving difference, differential, and integral equations, later known as the Laplace transform, appeared in “Mémoire sur les suites” (1782 a), where Laplace introduced generating functions. Laplace considered generating functions to be the approach of choice in solving problems that involved the development of functions in series and evaluation of the sums.
Years later, in composingabilités (1812), he subordinated all the analytical part Théorie Analytique des Probto the theory of generating functions and treated the entire subject as their field of application. In the early memoir, however, he emphasized what he expected to be their applicability to problems of nature. In an even earlier paper, “Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements” (1774), laplace stated the theorem permitting the analysis later termed bayesian [III.3](/part-03/bayesian-analysis).
Unknown to Laplace, Thomas Bayes had arrived at the same theorem eleven years earlier but had not developed it. Laplace for his part proceeded, in further investigations over some thirty years, to develop inverse probability into the basis for statistical inference, philosophical causality, estimation of scientific error, quantification of the credibility of evi-dence, and optimal voting rules in the proceedings of legislative bodies and judicial panels. His initial attrac-tion to the approach was its applicability to human concerns.
It was in the course of these papers, most notably “Mémoire sur les probabilités” (1780), that the word probability came to connote not merely the basic

753

quantity in the theory of games and chance but a subject in itself. paper on causality. The problem was to estimate the Laplace first addressed error theory in the above most appropriate mean value to be taken in a series of astronomical observations of the same phenomenon. He also determined how the limits of the error were related to the number of observations (“Mémoire sur les probabilités” above). In “Essai pour connaître la population du Royaume” (1783–91) Laplace turned to demo-graphic applications.
In the absence of census data, one needed to determine the multiplier to be applied to the number of births at any one time in order to estimate the approximate size of a population. The specific problem Laplace solved was the size of the sample required for the probability of error to fall within given limits. Only twenty-five years later did he return to the subject, in the course of preparing the comprehensive Laplace then put probabilistic investigation aside. Théorie Analytique des Probabilitésproblem of determining the mean value from a large.
In 1810 he returned to the number of observations, which he interpreted as the problem of the probability that the mean value falls within certain limits. He proved a law of large numbers, stating that if positive and negative errors in an indefi-nitely large number of observations are assumed to be equally possible, then their mean result converges to alimit in a precise way. From this analysis followed the least-squares law of error.
A priority dispute over the discovery of that law was even then simmering between gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833). Traité de Mécanique Célestethe two part “Mémoire sur la Théorie de Jupiter et de In a long series of investigations brought together in(1799–1825, five volumes), Saturne” (1788) demonstrates the most famous of his findings in planetary astronomy.
He established that the current acceleration in orbital motion of Jupiter andthe deceleration of Saturn are the reciprocal effects of their mutual gravitation, which are cyclical over many hundreds of years and not cumulative. From this and analysis of other phenomena that Laplace explored, it followed that the so-called secular inequalities of plan-etary motions are periodic over many centuries.
Thus, they are not derogations from the law of gravity but evidence that its validity extended beyond the Sun–planet attractions that had been studied by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727). He was never able to prove, however, that lunar acceleration is self-correcting over time. The expansion known by Laplace’s name in the theory of determinants first appears in the background

754

of the Jupiter–Saturn memoir in an analysis of the eccentricities and inclinations of orbits, “Recherches sur le calcul intégral et sur le système du monde” (1776). Except for that, Laplace’s mathematical original-ity is less not able in his analysis of planetary motion than in his development of the theory of probability. More in evidence in his astronomical work is his motivational drive and his power and virtuosity in calculation, which may indeed have been more important through out his long career.
Laplace was masterful in finding rapidly convergent series, in obtaining mathe-mat ical expressions incorporating terms to represent a multitude of physical phenomena, in justifying the neglect of in convenient quantities in order to reach solutions, and in giving the widest possible generality to his conclusions. The attraction exerted by a spheroid on an external or internal point proved to be mathematically the most fertile set of problems in Laplacian planetary astron-omy.
In “Théorie des attractions des sphéroïdes et de la figure des planètes” (1785) Laplace employed dre polynomials [III.85](/part-03/special-functions) in a form later called laplace le gen functions. He also proved a theorem that stated that all ellipsoids with the same foci for their principal sections attract a given point with a force proportional to their masses. Laplace’s angles appear in his development ofthe equation for the attraction of a spheroid on a given point. Laplace used polar coordinates in this analy-sis.
He transformed the equation into one in Cartesian coordinates in “Mémoire sur la théorie de l’anneau de Saturne” (1789). In 1828 George Green dubbed Poisson’s application of the formula to electrostatic and magnetic forces the potential function, the term used there after in classical physics.

Solutions ofthe differential equations involved led him to examine Legendre’s early research concerned the shape of properties of the functions that are named after him; he was in rivalry with Laplace, after whom the func-tions were named during the nineteenth century. His other main concern in analysis, and the longest lasting, was with elliptic integrals. He wrote on them at great length up to a Traité of 1825–28.
But in supplements of 1829–32 he acknowledged that his theory had just been eclipsed by the inverse elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem) ofous other (functions defined as) integrals, including the jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851) and abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829).

Among many properties of integers, he stressed quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), and proved various partition theorems concern-ing quadratic and some higher forms. Little in the book was new; while expanded editions appeared in 1808 and 1830, he had been quickly eclipsed on methods of proof by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) of the young Gauss.

Paris, 1830 Analysis; equations; heat theory Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt (1798–1801), important enough for the First Consul to make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s.
There after, Fourier moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himself to the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.The prefectureship involved heavy commitments, and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless, between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid bodies;
his “diffusion equation” for this purpose wasnot only novel in itself but also marked the first largescale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These series were already known but had a low status. Fourier (re)found many properties: not only the formulas for their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how a periodic series could represent a general function.

But Laplace also gave him a clue about solutions of the diffusion equation for1811, his integral solution (including in version) for infinite bodies, which led Fourier to find, by them.

(He used aninductive proof that has now become standard.) He also found an upper bound on the number of roots within agiven interval, which J. C. F. Sturm improved to an exact evaluation in 1829. At that time Fourier was trying to finish a book on equations, which appeared posthumously in 1831 thanks to Navier.
The main novelty wasthe basic theory of linear programming [III.84](/part-03/the-simplex-algorithm), as we now call it. Despite his prestige and advocacy, he gained few followers (Navier was one), and the theory lay dormant for over a century.

For the rest of his life Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun. Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the original observations, using the method of least squares, which he had invented but not published, to predict where Ceres would reappear.

In 1801 he published his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss, the book that created modern algebraic number theory. In it he gave the first rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), going on to find seven more proofs over the years.
Later he extended the theorem to higher powers, introducing the Gaussian integers for the purpose in 1831 (Gaussian integers are numbers of the formm + ni, where m and n are integers and i = . qrt{-1}). He did major work on differential equations, chiefly the hypergeometric equation, which is a second-order linear differential equation depending on three parameters and having two singular points, with the prop-erty that many of the familiar functions of analysis are related to its solutions.
He showed that this equation played a significant role in the new theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), but because most of this work was unpublished it had no influence on the dramatic and rapidly advancing publications of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and jacobi was the first mathematician to see the need to create[VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). This unpublished work showed that he a theory of complex functions of a complex variable.
He also gave four proofs oforem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra).

Credit for the first detailed, mathe-mat ical descriptions of a non-Euclidean space therefore rightly attaches to Bolyai and Lobachevskii (for further discussion of this, see1827 Gauss wrote his Disquisitiones Generales circa geometry [II.2 §7](/part-02/geometry-origins)). In

b. Pithiviers, France, 1781; d. Paris, 1840 Analysis; mechanics; mathematical physics; probability A brilliant graduate of the École Polytechnique in 1800, Poisson was quickly appointed to the staff, and became professor and graduation examiner there until his death. He was also founder professor of mechanics at the new Paris Faculté des Sciences of the Universitéde France;
from 1830 he was also a member of the governing Council of the Université.Poisson’s research output was dominated by his adherence to the traditions established by[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827).

From the mid 1810 s he challenged the new theories of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (especially the solving of differential equationsby trigonometric series and the Fourier integral) and ofanalysis using limits, and his innovation of complex-cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) (the new approach to real-variable variable analysis). His over all achievements were much less significant than theirs: the main novelties were the “Poisson integral,” which embedded Fourier series within a power series; and a summation formula.
He also studied the general and singular solutions of differential, difference, and mixed equations. that all physical phenomena were molecular, and that the cumulative action upon a molecule of all its com-In physics Poisson tried to justify Laplace’s claim panions should be expressed mathematically in terms of an integral. He applied this approach to heat diffusion and to elasticity theory by the mid 1820 s, but then decided that integrals should be replaced by sums; he elaborated this alternative especially in capillary theory (1831).
Curiously, molecularism did not dominate his most important contributions to physics: to electrostatics (1812–14) and to magnetic bodies and the process of magnetization (1824–27). His mathemat-ical contributions to these topics included modifying Laplace’s equation to what we now call Poisson’s equa-tion, which deals with the potential at points inside a charged body or region of charge (1814); and also adivergence theorem (1826).

Poisson’s motivation was to extend, to second-order terms in masses of the planets, Lagrange’s superb attempt to prove that the planetary system was sta-ble; in later work he examined this (first-order) problem specifically, as well as other aspects of perturbation theory.
He also analyzed rotating bodies by using moving frames of reference (1839), in an analysis that was to inspire Léon Foucault to propose his famous long pendulum in 1851. His best-known publications include a substantial and wide-ranging two-volume Traité de Mécanique (editions in 1811 and 1833), which did not, however, have room for Louis Poinsot’s beau-tiful recent theory (1803) of the couple in statics. In the mid 1810 s, he studied deep-body fluid dynamics, in rivalry with Cauchy.
Poisson was one of the few contemporaries to take up Laplace’s work in probability theory and mathe-mat ical statistics. He studied various probability distributions(1837, rather in passing) but also the so-called Cauchy[III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions): not only the one named after him (1824) and Rayleigh (1830) distributions. He also examined proofs of theand formulated the law of large numbers central limit theorem [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions),[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) (his term).
One of his main applications was to the old problem of determining the probability that a triad of judges would come to the correct decision in court cases (1837).

The value(nonempty) set of numbers with the property not-u in this formulation is a lower bound for the M. Bolzano’s lemma is therefore equivalent to what nowadays might be called the “greatest lower bound” axiom(or, more commonly and equivalently, the “least upper bound” axiom).
It is also equivalent to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (that every bounded infinite set in R, or more generally Rn, has an accumulation point). It is likely that covered the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, but it is also weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) independently redislikely that he knew, and was influenced by, Bolzano’sproof technique of iterated bisection (used by Bolzano in 1817). In the early 1830 s it was widely believed that a continuous function must be differentiable except at some isolated points.

Another major innovation of Cauchy dates from 1814, when he began to create complex-variable analysis. Initially the integrand was a complex function butthe limits of integration were real; however, from 1825 on they too became complex, and in this form he found many theorems on the residues of functions over closed domains of various shapes. Unusually for him, his progress was fitful, and he cast the theory in terms of the complex plane only in the mid 1840 s.

He showed in this way how points can be described by a homogeneous triple of coordin-ates, lines can be described by linear equations, the concept of cross-ratio can be introduced, and the duality of points and lines in the plane can be handled algebraically. He also introduced a Möbius net, which is the projective equivalent of squared paper in cartesian geometry.
His work is all the more remarkable because Möbius knew very little of Poncelet’s radical reinven-tion of projective geometry only a few years before. In its turn his work was for a time overshadowed by Jakob Steiner’s synthetic treatment of projective geometry of 1832, and then Plücker’s two books on algebraic curves in the 1830 s, but the simplicity and generality of Möbius’s methods were important in establishing projective geometry as a rigorous mainstream subject.
In the 1830 s Möbius developed a geometrical theory of statics and the composition of forces, and it was inthis connection that he showed that where as duality in plane geometry necessarily gives rise to a conic, duality in space need not. Möbius’s study of duality in space, which pairs points with planes, led him to consider the set of all lines in space, which is a four-dimensional space.
It pleased the educator Rudolf Steiner very much that the ordinary three-dimensional space may also be thought of as a four-dimensional space, because Steiner’s philosophy was directed against breaking what he saw as a stranglehold of orthodox teaching.

The university had just appointed Martin Bartels as Professor of Mathematics, and Bar-tels not only trained Lobachevskii well, but protected him from trouble with the authorities when Lo bac hev-skii was suspected of atheism.
Eventually, Lobachevskii graduated not with the ordinary degree but with a Master’s qualification, and his career as a professional mathematician began. In 1826, after a reform of the university, Lobachevskii gave a public lecture: “On the principles of geom-etry, with a rigorous demonstration of the theory of parallels.” The manuscript of this talk is now lost, butit probably marked the start of Lobachevskii’s awareness of a non-Euclidean geometry.

Loba-che vskii called these the parallels to the given line through the given point. Starting from this definition, he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles, and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the triangles are very small.
He extended his results todescribe a geometry of three dimensions, thus making it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to measure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account of space than Euclidean geometry. He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-grad ski i, a much better known mathematician in Saint Petersburg.

In this work, “potential function” (a term that he himself coined), he proved the three-dimensional version of the theorem now named after him, and introduced the concept that riemann [VI.49] later called Green’s function (1860).

His father—a minister of the church in Norway, but also at one timea government minister—over reached himself and when VI.33. Niels Henrik Abel he died he left the family in straitened circumstances. Abel’s exceptional intellectual talents were recognized at school, and funds were raised to enable him to complete his education and, in particular, to study mathe - matics.
At age twenty - two, he was awarded a scholarship to make a two-year tour of Europe, during which he studied in Berlin and Paris. In Berlin he met and was befriended by Auguste Crelle, the engineer who had just founded thewandte Mathematik (otherwise known as Journal für die reine und ange - Crelle’s Journal li shed in the first four volumes of the journal. From). Almost all of Abel’s mathematical work was pub1826 until his death in 1829 Abel eked out a poor existence, earning a little by teaching, but using what few resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother.
He died of consumption at the ageof twenty-seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin. Abel’s main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas. The first of these was the theory of equa - tions. Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) in 1770 and cauchy [VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) in 1815 about the form of functions of the roots of an equa - tion, and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted.
Lagrange had hinted at the possi-bility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between 1799 and 1814 trying to prove this, though he had not managed to persuade his contemporaries. Abel’s first success was to give an accept-able proof of the fact that, for polynomial equations of degree 5, there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution.
This first appeared in 1824 in a short pamphlet written in French and published privately in Christiania (Oslo). Once Abel reached Berlin, however, Crelle translated itinto German and published it in the first volume of his journal; he also published a fuller, more detailed account, covering polynomials of any degree greater than 4, in 1826.Abel returned to equations a few years later, publishing a long paper in 1829 about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions.
His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as a function of every other root, the second that these functions commute (in modern terms, the[V.21](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - quintic) of the equation is commutative). He proved var-galois group ious theorems about such equations, the most striking 761 being that they are soluble by radicals.
This represented an extensive generalization of the ideas described by gauss met ic ae[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) in the seventh part of, where the special case of cyclotomic equations Disquisitiones Arith(which satisfy both of these conditions) is treated sys - tematically. It was in honour of this work that, later, the adjective “Abelian” was applied to groups that are commutative. It is important to appreciate, however, that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations with out any appeal to groups, which at that time were not yet known. convergence.
Although there had been over a century of critical thinking devoted to foundations of the cal-He also made major contributions to the theory of culus, modern ideas of rigour were only just emerg-ing in the writings of bolzano [VI.28](/part - 06/bernard - bolzano - 17811848), Cauchy, and others. Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy’s lectures of 1820–21, but series in general, and power series in particular, were still far from well understood.
Among other contributions, Abel offered a proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers, and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel’s limit theorem. Perhaps his greatest discoveries, however, were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together. To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words:
first, a new and productive approach to the theory ofa vast generalization of elliptic functions to what are elliptic functions [V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem); and, second, now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals. Inthis area Abel competed for priority with jacobi [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851). Most (though by no means all) of his work was written in two memoirs.
One was published in two parts,“Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques” and “Précis d’une théorie des fonctions elliptiques,” coming to well over two hundred pages in Crelle’s Journal in 1828 and 1829. The other, entitled “Mémoire sur une propriété générale d’une classe très étendue de fonctions tran - scendantes,” was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October 1826. There it lay on Cauchy’s desk, unread until after Abel’s death. It was published by the Paris Academy in 1841. The manuscript itself, however, was stolen by G.

Probably inspiredby his father’s attempts to prove the parallel postulate, a key assumption in Euclidean geometry, but very much against the advice of his father, János also attempted to prove it.

He also showed that in his new geometry it was possible to construct a square equal inarea to a given circle, thus accomplishing a feat that was widely (and, as was later shown, correctly) believed to be impossible in Euclidean geometry.

He was baptized dur-ing his first year at the University of Berlin in 1821, probably in order to make it possible for him to follow an academic career at a time when Jews were ineligible for academic positions. Jacobi studied classics under the famous philologist Boeckh and philosophy under Hegel. Owing to the mediocrity of the mathematics VI.35.
Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi staff in Berlin at that time, he was self-taught inthe discipline, which soon became his favorite. He read euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783), lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813), laplace [VI.23](/part - 06/pierre - simon - laplace - 17491827), gausscians like Pappus and Diophantus. In 1825, Jacobi was[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), and, last but not least, Greek mathemat i awarded his doctorate for a thesis, written in Latin, on the theory of functions.
The subsequent disputatio (discussion) included critical comments both on Lagrange’s theory of functions and on his analytical mechanics. The following year Jacobi went to the University of Königsberg, where (in 1829) he got a full pro - fessorship. In 1834, he and the physicist F. E.
Neumann founded the “Königsberg mathematical physics seminar,” which, because of the close connection between research and teaching that it fostered, soon led to Königsberg becoming the most successful and influ-ential educational institution for theoretical physics and mathematics in the German-speaking part of the scientific world. By 1844, when Jacobi left Königsberg because of poor health and in order to become a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, he was rec-ognized as Germany’s most important mathematician after Gauss.
After seven more fruitful years of researchin Berlin he died unexpectedly from smallpox. mathematics, conceiving mathematical thinking as ameans of developing the human intellect and, indeed, Through out his life Jacobi was an advocate of pure of advancing humanity itself. He published his first paper in 1827: it was devoted to number theory (cubic residues) and was influenced by Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae higher residues, the division of the circle, quadratic. Further investigations were devoted to forms, and related subjects.
Many of Jacobi’s results in number theory were published in the book Canon arithmeticus divisibility to algebraic numbers by Jacobi and Gauss(1839). The extension of the concept of paved the way for the later algebraic theory of numbers(by kummer [VI.40] and others). ofelliptic functions Jacobi’s “most original achievements” (in the words klein [VI.57]) were his contributions to the theory of[V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem), which developed in competition with ing with legendre abel [VI.33](/part - 06/niels - henrik - abel - 18021829) between 1827 and 1829.
Start-’s [VI.24](/part - 06/adrien - marie - legendre - 17521833) work, Jacobi’s approach was analytical and focused on the transformation ofelliptic functions, their properties (like double periodicity), and the introduction of the inverse function. Jacobi’s research on elliptic functions culminated in the book ca rum Fundamenta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ellipti-(1829).
Together with Abel he should be viewed as one of the founders of the theory of complex func - 763 tions, which emerged in the second half of the century. In particular, his application of research on elliptic functions to Diophantine equations became important for the development of analytic number theory.
Jacobi’s contributions to algebra include investigations into the theory of determinants (the “Jacobi an” functional determinant) and their relation to inverse functions, into quadratic forms (“Sylvester’s law of inertia”), and into the transformation of multiple integrals. Even Jacobi’s work in mathematical physics bears the stamp of “pure mathematics”:
following the analytical tradition of Euler and Lagrange, he presented the foundations of mechanics in an abstract and formal man - ner, paying special attention to the relation between conservation laws space and to the unifying role of variational princi-[IV.12 §4.1](/part - 04/analysis) and symmetries of ples.
Jacobi’s achievements in this area, which he devel-oped in close relation to the theory of differential equations and the what is now called the “Jacobi–Poisson theorem,” the calculus of variations [III.94](/part - 03/variational - methods), include “principle of the last multiplier,” a theory for inte-grating hamilton’s [VI.37](/part - 06/william - rowan - hamilton - 18051865) canonical equations of motion Jacobi theory”), and a time-independent formulation of[IV.16 §2.1.3](/part - 04/mirror - symmetry) by transformation (“Hamilton the principle of least action (“Jacobi’s principle”).
His approach to these areas and the results he obtained are documented in two comprehensive books based on his lectures: Vorlesungen über Dynamik (1866) and Vorlesungen über Analytische Mechanik until 1996). The former had considerable impact on the(not published development of German mathematical physics in the last third of the nineteenth century.
The latter reveals Jacobi’s criticism of the traditional understanding of mechanical principles (as laws that are firmly based on empirical observation or a priori reasoning) and shows strong parallels with the “conventionalist” viewpoint, which did not become popular in science and philos-ophy until half a century later, when it numbered H.

In 1831 he was made a professor at the university and from then on held positionsat both institutions until 1855, when he was appointed as the success or to Göttingen. gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) at the University of His guiding star was Gauss’s pioneering Dirichlet’s primary interest was in number theory. Disquisitiones arithmetic aeber theory into a mathematical discipline—which he(1801)—the work that made num studied through out his career.
Dirichlet was not only the first mathematician to completely understand this work but he also became its interpreter, picking upits problems and improving its proofs, as well as developing its ideas. 1825, Dirichlet came to international prominence.
The paper, which dealt with Diophantine equations of the With his very first publication, which appeared in formx5 + y5 = Az5, yielded substantial results for the verification ofcasen = 5 (these results were used by fermat’s last theorem legendre[V.10](/part - 05/fermats - last - theorem) for the[VI.24](/part - 06/adrien - marie - legendre - 17521833) for a complete proof for that case some weeks later). Ina paper published in 1837 Dirichlet came up with the new and revolutionary idea of applying analytical meth-ods to number theory.
He introduced expressions that are now known as series of the form Dirichlet L-series. These are infinite

many prime numbers. In two subsequent papers, pub-lished in 1838 and 1839, he used his new methods, among other things, to determine the formula of the class number of binary quadratic forms: that is, the number of proper classes of forms of given determinant. It is often said that these three papers mark the start of analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Dirichlet also made important contributions to algebraic number theory, culminating in hisrem [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) for the Abelian group of units in an alge-unit theobraic number field.
These contributions, together with numerous others due to him (e.g., his Sc hu bf a ch pr inz ip, or box principle; work on the law of biquadratic reciprocity; and results concerning Gaussian sums), were brought together in his influential Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie by his former student(lectures on number theory), published dedekind [VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in 1863.
Inspired by his close contact with fourier [VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) during his student days in Paris, Dirichlet’s other main interests were in analysis and mathematical physics, and in the connections between them. In a ground-breaking paper of 1829, Dirichlet not only gave the first strict proof of the convergence of a Fourier series under given conditions, but he also used new methods and concepts (e.g., his insight into the importance of conditional convergence of series;
his Dirichlet function influencing the development of the concept of a function) that became classic and that served as a basis for count less nineteenth - century investigations on analy - sis. He also occupied himself with the determination of multiple integrals as well as with the expansion ofa function into spherical functions (Kugelfunktionen) and applied these results to problems in mathematical physics.
His main contributions to mathematical physics include papers on the theory of heat, hydrodynamics, the gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid, the$n$-body problem, and potential theory. The first boundary-value problem (the “Dirichlet problem” of finding the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region) had already been handled by Fourier and others, but Dirichlet proved the uniqueness of the solution, while the dirichlet principle ing boundary problems for[IV.12 §3.5](/part - 04/analysis)

Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school, his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind, Eisen - stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), and riemann [VI.49], among others.

Hamilton developed his approach to optics over the following five years, pub-li shing three substantial supplements to his original paper. He showed that the properties of an optical sys-tem are completely determined by a certain “characteristic function” that is a function of the initial and final coordinates of a ray of light and which measures the time of passage of light through the system.
In 1832 he predicted that light falling at a certain angle on a biax-ial crystal would be refracted to form a hollow cone of emergent rays. This prediction was verified by his friend and colleague Humphrey Lloyd. 765 dynamics. In a paper “On a general method in dynam - ics” (1834), he showed that the dynamics of a system Hamilton adapted his optical methods to the study of of attracting and repelling point particles is completely determined by a certain characteristic function, which satisfies a differential equation, today referred to asthe hamilton–jacobi equation [IV.12 §2.1](/part -

Most of his subsequent math-ematical work involved quaternions. It is not difficult to translate much of this work into the language of modern vector analysis, and indeed many of the basic concepts and results of vector algebra and analysis emerged from Hamilton’s work on quaternions.
Hamil-ton applied quaternion methods to the study of dynamics in a series of short papers published in the three years immediately following his discovery of quaternions. He also investigated a number of algebraic sys-tems related to quaternions. However, most of his work with quaternions was concerned with their application to the study of geometrical problems, and, in particular, to the study of surfaces of the second order and (especially in the final years of his life) to the study of the differential geometry of curves and surfaces.
Much of this research is to be found in his two books Quaternions (1853) and Elements of Quaternions Lectures on(1866, published posthumously). Further Reading Hankins, T.

He taught analysis and mechanics at his alma mater, the École Polytechnique, until 1851, when he became professor at the Collège de France. More over, he was professor at the Sorbonne from 1857 and member of the Paris Academy of Sciences and the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1836 he founded the Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquéesthis day.
, which exists to His wide-ranging research was often inspired by physics. For example, his early theory of differential operators of the form(d/dx)k, where k is an arbitrary complex number, had its origin in Ampère’s electro - dynamics. Similarly, Sturm–Liouville theory, which he developed in around 1836 with his friend C. F. Sturm, was inspired by the theory of heat conduction.
Sturm Liouville theory deals with a linear self-adjoint second-order differential equation involving a parameter that must be chosen so that there exist nontrivial solutions(eigenfunctions) that satisfy given boundary-value conditions. Liouville’s main contribution to this theory wasa proof that an “arbitrary” function has a convergent “Fourier expansion” in terms of eigenfunctions. Sturm Liouville theory was a major step toward a more qual-it ative theory of differential equations, and the first work on spectral theory of a general class of differential operators.

Liouville showed that Jacobi was right, and more over proved the surprising result that only the latter fig-ure is in stable equilibrium.

In July 1829, after his father’s sui-cide, Galois was again rejected by the École Polytechnique. He entered the École Préparatoire (later known asthe École Normale Supérieure) in October 1829 but was expelled in December 1830 for unacceptable behaviour arising from political disagreements with the author i-ties.
Arrested on Bastille Day (14 July) 1831, he spent the next eight months in prison for flouting authority again. He emerged at the end of April 1832 but some how got himself challenged to a duel. On 29 May he edited his manuscripts and wrote a summary of his dis-coveries in a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The duel took place the next morning and he died on 31 May1832. Much has been written about him.

The first to be published was “Sur la théorie des nombres,” which appeared in April 1830 and contains the theory of Galois fields.
These are analogues of the complex numbers obtained by adjoining to the integers modulo a prime numberp a root of an irreducible poly- nomial congruence modulo of the basic features of what later became the theory ofp. The paper contains most finite fields. In the letter to Chevalier written on the eve of the duel, Galois mentions three memoirs.
The first, now known as thet led “Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations Premier Mémoire, is a manuscript entipar radicaux.” Galois submitted work on the theory ofequations to the Paris Academy on 25 May and 1 June 1829, but this is now lost and it seems quite possible that Galois with drew it on the advice of Cauchy (towhom it had been given to referee) in January 1830.
In February 1830 he resubmitted his work in compe-tition for the Grand Prix de Mathématiques, but his manuscript was unfortunately and mysteriously loston the death of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (and the prize was awarded jointly to jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851)).

when the abstract notion of field developed later in the nineteenth century, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fields had already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois theory developed directly out of the material in the Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed from the ideas in the Mémoire together with a series of papers published by Premier Mémoire and the Second Cauchy in 1845.

compete for positions at England’s Anglican universi-ties. This effectively forced him down a convoluted path toward his personal goal of a career as a research mathematician. He worked as an actuary in London in the1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by passing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some six years in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-ics, in England and in the United States.
Most notably, Sylvester served as the first Professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold professorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health forced his retirement in 1894.
The program sylvester set up at Johns Hopkins established his pivotal place in the history of American research-level mathematics, while his mathematical accomplishments had garnered him an international reputation as early as the 1860 s. with work on the problem of determining when two polynomial equations have a common root.

Sylvester followed this up with what he called the dialytic method of elimination:
a new criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detecting whether two polynomial equations have a common root (1841).His next major research push came in the 1850 s when, together with theory of invariants. This involved an associated and cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More concretely, given a binary form of a particular degree, Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for explicitly finding invariants and covariants of that form and for determining algebraic relations, or
“syzygies,” between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two important papers: “On the principles of the calculus of forms” (1852) and “On a theory of the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions” (1853). In the latter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law of inertia: if$Q(x^{1}$, . . . , xn) is a real quadratic form [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rankr , then there exists a (real) nonsingular

However, he then entered a fallow period that ended only with his move to Baltimore.
While there, he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the problem of inductively determining, for binary forms first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4, etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generating set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordan had proved that this number is always finite and, in so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley, who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, the binary form of degree 5) was infinite.
By 1879, Sylvester had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly independent covariants associated with a binary form of any given degree. Sylvester was the founding editor of the American Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80), and on matrix algebras
(1884), appeared there.

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested inbuilding telescopes and scientific instruments than making shoes—the result being that his business failed and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen and take a job as a junior teacher to support his parents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and together they built functioning scientific instruments.
Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age of twenty he was publishing original research in calculus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to others such asto develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded the cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on operators in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-ics to be presented by the society.
The paper was important not only because it contained (arguably forthe first time) a clear definition of the concept of an operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as differentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as an object in its own right. There was an explicit similarity between the laws he derived for functions of D and the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss below.
