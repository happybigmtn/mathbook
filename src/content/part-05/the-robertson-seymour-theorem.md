Aa setgraph V (G)G is a mathematical structure that consists ofof vertices and a set E(G) of edges, where each edge links a pair of vertices. Graphs can be used torepresent many different networks in an abstract way. For example, the vertices might represent cities, and the edges might represent highways linking the cities; sim-ilarly, we could use a graph to represent which islands of an archipelago are linked by bridges, or to repre-sent the wires of a telephone network. Among graphs there are certain families of “nice” graphs. One such family is the family of cycles: ak-cycle is a set of k ver- tices arranged around a circle with each point joinedby an edge to the points immediately before and after it. Another family is that of complete graphs: the complete graph of orderof which are joined.k consists of k vertices, all pairs when families of graphs are involved, is that of a Given a graph An important concept in graph theory, particularly G, a minor of G is any graph you canminor. obtain by applying a sequence of operations of twokinds, known as contractions and deletions, applied to edges.

For example, if you contract an edge of Deleting an edge means what one would guess: for example, if you deletean edge from a 9-cycle you will get a path with nine vertices and eight edges.It is not hard to check that a graph H is a minor of Gsets ofif and only if we can find a collection of disjoint sub-G, one for each vertex of H, with the follow- ing properties: they should be connected, which means that any two vertices in one of the subsets are joinedto each other by a path in that subset, and for any pair of vertices in H that are linked by an edge in H the

two corresponding subsets ofedge. For example, a graph has a 3-cycle (or G should be linked by antriangle) as a minor if and only if it contains a cycle. note that if a graph is planar (meaning that it can bedrawn in the plane in such a way that edges do not For an example of how minors can arise naturally, cross), then so is any minor of it. This is expressed bysaying that the class of planar graphs is minor closed. Now, there is a theorem of Kuratowski that tells us which graphs are planar. One form that this theorem takes is the following statement: a graph is planar if and only if it does not have either where K denotes the complete graph of order 5, and K5 or (K3(),){3} as a minor, Kof two sets of three vertices, with every vertex in one se(t3(),){3} \text{denotes the}5 \text{complete bipartite graph that consists joined to every vertex in the other set}.

Hence, any general solution of (2) cannot be given by a simple formula: the best we can hope foris a solution in the form of an infinite series. It is not difficult to find series that work well enough for a limited time span: the problem is to find series that workfor any initial configuration and for any time span, no matter how long. There is also the question of colli-sions. A complete solution to the problem has to take account of all possible motions of the bodies, including determining which initial conditions lead to binary and triple collisions. Since collisions are described by sin-gularities in the differential equations, this means that to find a complete solution the singularities have to be understood. one might think. It is obvious from the equations thata collision gives rise to a singularity, but it is less clear This turns out to be a more interesting problem than whether there can be any other kind of singular behav-ior. In the case of the three-body problem, the answer was supplied by Painlevé in 1897: the collisions are theonly singularities. However, for more than three bodies the answer turned out to be different. In 1908 a swedish astronomer, Hugo von Zeipel, showed that noncollision singularities becomes unbounded in a finite amount of time. A goodcan occur only if the system of particles example of such a singularity was found by Zhihong Xiafor the five-body problem in 1992. In this case there are two pairs of bodies, the bodies in each pair having equalmass, and a fifth body with very small mass. The bodies in a pair move in very eccentric orbits parallel to the xyplane and rotating in opposite directions. A fifth parti--plane, with the two pairs on opposite sides of this cle is then added to the system. Its motion is confinedto thez-axis and oscillates between the two pairs. Xia showed that the motion of the fifth particle forced the two pairs to move away from thexy-plane, but that it

also came closer and closer to colliding with the pairs, giving it larger and larger bursts of acceleration, and that as this happened the two pairs were forced out toinfinity in finite time. one can look for interesting particular solutions. Atral configuration As well as trying to solve the problem in general, is defined to be a solution in which cen the geometric configuration remains constant. The first examples were discovered by Euler in 1767: they were solutions in which the bodies always lie on a straight line and revolve with uniform angular velocity in circles or ellipses about their common center of mass. In1772 Lagrange discovered solutions in which the bodies are always at the vertices of an equilateral triangle that rotates uniformly about the center of mass. For almost all sets of initial conditions for these solutions, the size of the triangle changes as it rotates so that each body describes an ellipse.However, despite the discovery of the particular solutions and a century of unrelenting work on the prob-lem, the mathematicians of the nineteenth century were unable to find a general solution. Indeed, the problem was considered so hard that in 1890 Poincaré was led to declare that he thought it impossible without the discovery of some significant new mathematics. But, contrary to Poincaré’s expectation, less than twenty years later a young Finnish mathematical astronomer, Karl Sundman, using only existing mathematical techniques, astonished the mathematical world by obtain-ing uniformly convergent infinite series that mathematically “solved” the problem. Sundman’s series, whichare in powers of$t1^{/}3$, are convergent for all real t, except for the negligible set of initial conditions for which the angular momentum is zero. To deal with binary collisions, Sundman used the technique of regularization the collision, but he was unable to deal with triple colli-, or analytically extending a solution beyond sions because in order for such a collision to occur the angular momentum must be zero.Although it was a remarkable mathematical achievement, Sundman’s solution leaves many questions unan-swered. It provides no qualitative information about the behavior of the system and, worse, because the series converges so slowly it is of no practical use. Todetermine the motion of the bodies for any reasonable period of time would require the summation of some-thing of the order of 108000000 terms, a calculation that is patently unrealistic. Thus, Sundman left plenty stillto do, and work on the problem (and the relatedn- body problem) has continued up to the present day,

728

with exciting results continuing to appear. One recent example is a convergent power-series solution for the generaln-body problem, which was discovered by Don Wang in 1991.Since the three-body problem itself proved so intractable, simplified versions were developed, of whichthe most famous is the one now known as the restricted three-body problem (the name is due to Poincaré), which was first investigated by Euler. In this case, twoof the bodies (the primaries) revolve around their joint center of mass in circular orbits under the influenceof their mutual gravitational attraction, while the third body (the planetoid), which is assumed to have such small mass that the force it exerts on the other two bod-ies can be neglected, moves in the plane defined by the primaries. The advantage of this formulation is that themotion of the primaries can be treated as a two-body problem and is hence known; it remains only to investigate the motion of the planetoid, which can be doneusing perturbation theory. Although the restricted formulation might appear artificial, it provides a good approximation to real physical situations, such as, for example, the problem of determining the motion of the Moon around Earth given the presence of the Sun.Poincaré wrote extensively on the restricted problem, and the techniques he developed to tackle it led to his discovery of mathematical chaos, as well as laying the foundations for modern dynamical systems [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics) theory.Apart from its intrinsic appeal as a problem that is simple to state, the three-body problem has a fur-ther attribute that has contributed to its attraction for potential solvers: its intimate link with the fundamental question of the stability of the solar system. Thatis the question of whether the planetary system will always keep the same form as it has now, or whether, eventually, one of the planets will escape or, perhaps worse, experience a collision. Since bodies in the solar system are approximately spherical and their dimen-sions extremely small when compared with the distances between them, they can be considered as point masses. Ignoring all other forces, such as solar winds or relativistic effects, and taking only gravitational forces into account, the solar system can be modeled as a ten-body problem with one large mass and nine small ones, and it can be investigated accordingly.Over the years, attempts to find a solution to the three-body problem (and the relatedn-body prob- lem), have spawned a wealth of research. As a result, the importance of the problem is as much in the

mathematical advances it has generated as in the prob-lem itself. A notable example of this is the development of KAM theory, which provides methods for integrating perturbed Hamiltonian systems and obtaining results that are valid for infinite periods of time. This was developed in the 1950 s and 1960 s by[VI.88](/part-06/andrei-nikolaevich-kolmogorov-19031987), Arnold, and Moser. kolmogorov Thurston’s Geometrization Conjecture See the poincaré conjecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture) V.34 The Uniformization Theorem The uniformization theorem is a remarkable classifi-cation of riemann surfaces [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces).

Loosely speaking, these spaces the whole ofto the sphere or to It can be shown that an open subset of C cannot be bi holomorphically equivalent C. Therefore, by the uniformization C that is not theorem, a simply connected open subset ofnot the whole of C must be bi holomorphically equiva-C that is lent to the hyperbolic plane.

So the Rie- mann mapping theorem implies that the interior ofany simple closed curve can be mapped in an anglepreserving way to the open unit disk. Recall that one ofthe main models of the hyperbolic plane is Poincaré’s disk model. Thus, the hyperbolic metric on the disk together with the biholomorphic map that is givenby the uniformization theorem can be used to define

If a Riemann surface is not simply connected, it is at least aface, namely its quotient universal cover[I.3 §3.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of a simply connected sur-[III.93](/part-03/universal-covers). For example, a torus is a quotient of the complex plane (in many possible ways that are topologically but not bi holomorphically equivalent). Thus, the uniformization theorem tells us that a general Riemann surface is a quotient of the sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane.

Brian Osserman

The Weil conjectures constitute one of the central landmarks of twentieth-century algebraic geometry [IV.4](/part-04/algebra): not only was their proof a dramatic triumph, but they were the driving force behind a striking number of fundamental advances in the field. The conjec-tures treat a very elementary problem: how to count the number of solutions to systems of polynomial equa-tions over finite fields [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). While one might ultimately be more interested in solutions over, say, thefield of rational numbers, the problem is far more tractable over finite fields, andciples [III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory) such as the birch–swinnerton-dyerlocal–global pr in conjecture tion ships between the two cases.[V.4](/part-05/the-birchswinnerton-dyer-conjecture) establish strong, albeit subtle, rel an on obvious connections to the Weil conjectures.

Kuga, Ihara, and Deligne showed that in fact Ramanu-jan’s conjecture is a consequence of the Weil conjectures, so that Deligne’s proof of the latter in 1974 also resolved the former.We begin with a brief historical summary of developments prior toprecise description of the statement of his conjectures.weil [VI.93](/part-06/andr-weil-19061998) and follow this with a more Finally, we sketch the ideas behind their proof. 1 An Auspicious Prologue Our story begins with the seminal work of riemann [VI.49] on the classicalwe recall is defined by the sumzeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), which

eulerofs, but Riemann, in his remarkable eight-page paper[VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) had studied this function for real values of 1859, went much further. He looked at complex val-ues as well, and therefore had at his disposal the considerable resources of complex analysis. In particular, although the above sum forζ(s) converges only for complex numberss that have real part Re(s) strictly greater than 1, Riemann showed that the function itselfcan be extended to an analytic function defined on the entire complex plane, except at the point$s = 1$, \text{at which} it tends to infinity. He showed, moreover, that satisfies a certain functional equation relatingζ(s)ζ(s)toζ(metry around the line Re1 - s), which introduced an important kind of sym-(s) =1. Most famously (or infamously), he conjectured what is now known as the riemann hypothesis [I.4 §3](/part-01/general-goals): that, aside from easily2 analyzed “trivial zeros” on the negative real axis, everyzero ofζ(s) occurs on the line Re(s) =1. Riemann’s motivation for studying tr i but i on of prime numbers, but it fell to later authorsζ(s) was to analyze the dis-2 (Van Koch) to bring this vision to fruition. They used hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), de la vallée poussin [VI.67](/part-06/charles-jean-de-la-valle-poussin-18661962), and the zeta function to prove the[I.4 §3](/part-01/general-goals), which determined the asymptotic distribution prime number theorem of prime numbers, and also showed that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to a particularly strong upper bound for the error term in the prime number theorem. to be completely special, a one-of-a-kind conjecture.However, it was not long before At first glance, the Riemann hypothesis might appear dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) generalized the Riemann hypothesis to a whole family ofzeta functions, and in doing so opened the door to further generalization.

Starting from this observation, Dedekind$K$ defined a more general class of zeta functions, one foreach such ring, which now bear his name. The classical zeta function the case O =ζ(s)Z. However, it was not at all straight for-was the Dedekind zeta function in ward to establish the existence of a functional equation for Dedekind zeta functions: this was an open problem$K$ until 1917, when it was settled by Hecke, who showedat the same time that Dedekind zeta functions could be extended to the complex plane, thereby ensuring thatthe Riemann hypothesis makes sense for them as well. geometry entered the picture.duced zeta functions and the Riemann hypothesis for With such ideas in the air, it was not long before artin [VI.86](/part-06/emil-artin-18981962) first intro certain curves over finite fields in his 1923 thesis, not-ing that the ring of polynomial functions on such a curve shares precisely the properties of rings of inte-gers that Dedekind used to define his zeta functions. Artin quickly observed first that his new zeta func-tions were strongly analogous to Dedekind zeta functions, and second that they were often more tractable: evidence for both observations is provided by the fact that he was able to check explicitly that the Rie-mann hypothesis was satisfied for a number of specific curves. The difference between the two situations is encapsulated as follows: while in the number field case one can think of the zeta function as counting primes, in the case of a function field the zeta function may be expressed in terms of the more geometric data ofcounting points on the given curve. In a 1931 paper F. K. Schmidt generalized Artin’s work, and exploited this geometry to prove a strong form of the functional equation for such zeta functions. And then, in 1933, Hasse proved the Riemann hypothesis in the special case of elliptic curves [III.21](/part-03/elliptic-curves) over finite fields. 2 Zeta Functions of Curves We now discuss in more detail the definition and prop-erties of zeta functions associated with curves over finite fields, as well as the theorems of Schmidt and Hasse.

The nicest form of Schmidt’s theorem applies to curves that satisfy two additional conditions.

Sec-$ond$, we will want to impose a technical condition of smoothness on C, which is analogous to asking that C be a In order to state Schmidt’s result, recall that there ismanifold [I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). a notion of the genus [IV.4 §10](/part-04/algebra) of a smooth projective

3 Enter Weil

In 1940 and 1941, Weil gave two proofs of the riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. Or, to be more accurate, he described two proofs: they both relied on fundamental facts in algebraic geometry which hadbeen proved by analytic methods for varieties over the complex numbers, but which had not been proved rig-orously in the case of arbitrary base fields. It was largely in order to address this deficiency that Weil wrote his Foundations of Algebraic Geometry , which appeared in 1948 and allowed both of his earlier proofs to be made rigorous. geometry, as it introduced for the first time the notionof an Weil’s book constituted a watershed in algebraic abstract algebraic variety. Previously, a variety was always a global object, in that it was defined by a single collection of polynomial equations, in either affine or projective space. Weil realized that it would be helpful to have a corresponding locally defined concept, so he introduced abstract algebraic varieties, which are obtained by gluing together affine algebraic varieties in much the same way that manifolds in topology are obtained by gluing together open subsets of affine space. The notion of an abstract variety playeda fundamental role in formalizing Weil’s proofs, and was also an important precursor to Grothendieck’simmensely successful theory of schemes [IV.5 §3](/part-04/arithmetic-geometry). letin of the American Mathematical Society The following year, in a remarkable paper in the, Weil went Bul further, studying zeta functions higher-dimensional varieties Vover finite fields, and$Z^{V} (t) \text{associated with}$ taking as his definition the formula (1). While the situ-ation is more complicated in this context, the behavior conjectured by Weil was nonetheless strikingly similar, an utterly natural extension of the case of curves: (ii) more explicitly, if(i)ZV (t) is a rational function of Pn(t)P= \dim (t)V· · ·, we can writet; P (t)ZV (t) = (P1)0(t)(P3)2(t) · · · (P2()n()2()n)-1(t), where each root of eachof norm$q^{-i}/^{2}$;$P^{i}(t) \text{is a complex number}$ (iii) the roots of P (t) are interchanged with the rootsi

Instead of indirect methods, we find a real mastery of the intri-cacies (and power) of proportion theory. At the same time, his propositions easily lend themselves to the consider at i on of different subcases: when, for instance, a certain line falls inside, outside, or on the vertex of aconical surface. Apollonius, in other words, combines a systematic approach with an almost playful fascination with exploring the possibilities of mathematical objects and their properties under varying circumstances.

Cardano’s own great insight was to recognize the existence ofrelations between the roots and the coefficients of an equation; in this he was unprecedented. He also showeda greater readiness than most of his contemporaries to contemplate the square roots of negative numbers.He is remembered today for “Cardano’s rule” for solving cubic equations of the form$x3 + cx = d$, where

Cardano was aware that what we today call complex numbers (num-bers of the forma + b\sqrt{-1}) could arise in the solution of quadratic equations. Bombelli made the important discovery that what at first sight appears to be a complex root of a cubic equation may in fact be a real root, because the imaginary parts cancel each other out.

His earliest scientific writings were his lectures to Catherine. He spent the remainder of his life in high public office, apart from a period between 1584 and 1589 when he was banished from the court in Paris for political and religious reasons. He died in Paris in 1603.Through out his life, it was only during the time he had free from official duties that he was able to devote himself to mathematics. during the 1590 s, beginning with The work for which Viète is best known appeared In Artem Analyticem Isagoge In the Isagoge(“Introduction to the analytic art”) in 1591.Viète began to combine classical Greek

geometry with algebraic methods that had originated from Islamic sources, and in doing so laid the foundations for the algebraic approach to geometry. Viète saw that the symbols in equations (traditionally variants of R, Q, and C, for the unknown, its square, and its cube) could represent either numbers or geometric quanti-ties, and that this was potentially a powerful tool for analyzing and solving geometric problems. reading of thefourth century Viète’s understanding of analysis was based on his Synagogec.e.), where analysis was described as(“Collection”) of Pappus (early a method of investigating a problem by assuming thatthe solution is in some sense known, as we would do now by representing the solution by a symbol and car-rying out mathematical manipulations involving that symbol. Algebra achieves this by regarding all quan-tities, known or unknown, as of equal status; equations are then formed from prestated conditions (a process Viète called unknown quantity in terms of those given (zetetics), and solved to produce the exegetics). For Viète the final step in geometric problems was toprovide a specific construction for the solution: this was the geometric synthesis arising from the preceding algebraic In several further treatises, mostly written or pub-analysis. lished around 1593, Viète taught the necessary skillsof forming equations and carrying out the corresponding geometric constructions, and these books together made up hisseu Algebra Nova Opus Restitutae Mathematicae Analyseos,(“The work of restored mathematical analysis, or the new algebra”), which he offered with thefamous and ambitious hope of leaving no mathematical problem unsolved (nullum problema non solvere). For most of the seventeenth century, algebra continued tobe known as the “analytic art,” or simply “analysis.” algebraically, Viète also put forward a method ofnumerical solution based on successive approxima-Recognizing that not all equations could be solved tions.

Stockholm, 1650 Algebra; geometry; analytic geometry; foundations of mathematics In 1637 Descartes published La Géométrie as an “essay” appended to his philosophical treatise Méthode. It remained his only mathematical publica-Discours de la tion. No single early modern text shaped the devel-opment of mathematics between 1650 and 1700 as strongly asanalytic geometry and it paved the way for the merging La Géométrie. It was the founding text of of algebra and geometry that made possible the devel-opment of the integral and differential calculus about fifty years later.Descartes was educated at the Jesuit College at La Flèche. He spent his life mostly outside France, travel-ing through Europe in his early twenties and living in the Netherlands from 1628 until 1649; he then left for Sweden, invited by Queen Christina to her court. From an early age his interest in mathematics was tightly linked to his primary philosophical preoccupation: the certainty of knowledge. In a letter of 1619 he sketcheda method, clearly inspired by arithmetic and geometry, for solving all problems in natural philosophy. shortly afterward, his ideas grew into a passionate conviction that he could and should develop a philosophy along these problem-solving and mathematics-inspired lines.

Descartes offered little in the way ofgeneral principles, explaining his ideas by means of examples.Descartes used a classical problem, Pappus’s problem, in order to explain coordinates and equations ofcurves, and showed that the defining property of a curve could be written as an equation. He introduced coordinate sx and y, using oblique as well as rectan- gular coordinate axes, which he always adjusted to the problem at hand. He also introduced the now very common usage of employinga, b, and cfor indeterminate fixed quantities.x, y , and z for unknowns and metrical answer. The equation was at best an algebraic reformulation of the problem; the answer had to be a For Descartes, a geometrical problem required a geo construction of the curve or of individual points. If, asin the particular case of Pappus’s problem in four lines, the equation was quadratic, then for any fixed value of y Earlier in the book Descartes had shown how such athe x-coordinate was a root of a quadratic equation.

There-xs and points on the curve. Pointwise fore in Pappus’s problem Descartes used the equationto show that the solution curves were conic sections, and explained how to determine the nature of the conic, the location of its axes, and the values of its parameters.This was an impressive result; it was, in fact, the first classification of an algebraically defined class of curves. one of which Descartes himself said he was most proud, A further influential result in La Géométrie, and the was his method to determine the normal (and thusalso the tangent) at a given point on a curve with a given equation. It was a pre-calculus forerunner of differentiation. Descartes treated curves and their equations and how There are three important differences between how they are treated in modern analytic geometry: heemployed oblique as well as rectangular axes; he did not consider the equation as defining a curve—ratherit represented a problem, namely to construct the curve itself, as well as its axes, tangents, etc.; and he did not consider the plane itself as a collection of points char-acterized by pairs of real numbers—for him thexs andyof line segments.

He gave no proofs; his results were based on a convic-tion that polynomials could essentially be written as products of linear factorsx - xi, in which the roots xi could be positive, negative, or “imaginary.”It appears, then, that analytic geometry was not the primary goal ofprovide a universal method for solving geometrical La Géométrie. Rather, its aim was to problems, and to do so Descartes had to answer two urgent methodological questions. The first was how tosolve geometrical problems not constructible by ruler and compass, and the second was how to use algebraas an analytic, i.e., solution-finding, tool in geometry. For the first of these, Descartes allowed successively more complicated curves as means of construction. Itwas Descartes’s conviction that algebra, through the equations of these curves, could guide him to choose, among all such construction curves, the most appropriate for the problem, in particular the simplest, i.e., that of lowest degree.The second question addressed serious conceptual difficulties that were felt at the time about using alge-bra in geometry. The transfer of algebraic operations to geometry was indeed problematic because multiplication in geometry was generally interpreted dimen-sionally: for example, a product of two lengths had to represent an area, and a product of three a volume.But until then algebra had dealt mostly with numbers and had routinely used products of more than three factors. Thus, a consistent and unrestricted geomet-rical interpretation of the operations of algebra was needed. Descartes did indeed provide such a reinter-pretation. He introduced a unit line segment in such a way that multiplication no longer raised the dimension and in homogeneous terms could be allowed inequations. link philosophy and mathematics. Yet the preoccupa-tion with certainty remained. As his concept of con-By 1637 he had given up on his earlier attempts to struction involved the use of curves, he had to consider which curves could be understood by the human mind

with sufficient clarity to be acceptable in geometry. Hisanswer was that all algebraic curves were acceptable (he called these “geometrical curves”) and all others werenot (these he called “mechanical”). Few seventeenth century mathematicians followed Descartes in this strict demarcation of geometry. This is typical of the reception of Descartes’s La Géométrie: the philosophical and methodological aspects of the book were largely ignored by his mathematical readers, but the technical mathematical aspects were eagerly accepted and used.

In his manuscript circulated in Paris in 1637 (the same year as Descartes’s Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge, which La Géométriedling and solving indeterminate problems associated), Fermat presented a general way of hanwith constructions of loci: that is, of sets of points (usu-ally curves) defined by some constraints. He identified

VI.13. Blaise Pascal

the points of such loci by two coordinates linked by anequation (although he chose a different way of taking coordinates from the usual modernx and y coordin- ates). Moreover, Fermat gave the standard forms of the corresponding equation when the locus to be found was a line, a parabola, an ellipse, etc.Fermat also used algebraic analysis to solve problems of extrema, including finding the tangent or the normal to a curve at a given point, and determining centers of gravity. His method relies on the principle that a certain algebraic expression takes on the same values twice near the extremum. Although the procedure is purely algebraic, his successors tended to interpret it from a differential perspective, thereby makinghis work an apparent precursor of the calculus. Fermat applied the method to a variety of problems, includ-ing (within the framework of a controversy with Descartes’s followers around 1660) a proof of the law of refraction in optics. Basing his analysis on the principle that “nature acts in the shortest time,” Fermat was able to express the problem as one of extrema and to solve itwith his method. The problem of refraction was one of the first complex physical problems to be treated in a thoroughly mathematical way, and Fermat’s approach later led to variational methods [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). \text{more classical}, \text{for instance Archimedean}, techniques, \text{which he used when dealing with other types of geo} - However, \text{Fermat also showed a perfect mastery of metrical questions such as quadrature}.\text{Such versatility also appears in Fermat}’s \text{work on numbers}. \text{On the one hand}, \text{he was happy to apply his algebraic approach to Diophantine analysis in order to obtain solutions for cases previously thought to be insoluble}, \text{or to derive new solutions from ones already known}. \text{On the other hand}, \text{he advocated a theoretical study of the integers}, \text{for which the currently available algebraic theory of equations was not sufficient}. \text{For example}, \text{he gave general properties of the divisors ofnumbers of the forman} ± 1 (\text{among them his now cel}- \text{ebr at ed various Nlittle theorem}. \text{He invented the method of infinite descent}[III.58](/part - 03/modular - arithmetic)) \text{and of} x2 + Ny2 for specifically to deal with problems concerning integers.He used this method, which relies on the impossibility of constructing an infinite strictly decreasing sequenceof integers, to prove that$a^{4} - b^{4} = c^{2} \text{has no nontrivial}$ integer solutions.

b. Leipzig, Germany, 1646; d. Hanover, Germany, 1716 Calculus; theory of linear equations and elimination theory; logic Renowned among mathematicians for his invention ofthe calculus, Leibniz was a universal thinker who graduated in law and was self-taught in mathematics. In1676 he became counselor and librarian in Hanover for the Duke Johann Friedrich of Braunschweig–Lüneburg, holding this position until the end of his life. Besides mathematics he occupied himself with technical, his-tor io graphical, political, religious, and philosophical questions. His philosophy distinguished between twoareas of reality: the world of appearances and the world of substances. It was in developing his philosophy thathe was led to declare that the real world is “the best of all possible worlds.” In 1700 he was appointed first president of the newly founded Brandenburg Society of Sciences established in Berlin.

He was always more interested in general or even universal methods than in technical details, using analogy and inductive reasoning to develop the art ofinvention. For the same reason he became a key creator of mathematical notation: he knew how much a suitable notation could facilitate mathematical discoveries. treatise on infinitesimal geometry (written in 1675–76 but not published until 1993). In it he used his “quanta”One of Leibniz’s earliest mathematical works was a concept of the infinite. In Leibniz’s eyes the actual infi-nite as well as indivisibles, in the strictest sense of the word, were not quantities and therefore not mathemati-cal entities: hence, he used the notions “infinitely small” and “infinitely large.” These denoted, it is true, variable quantities, but nevertheless they were quantities of a sort, so they could be handled by mathematics.

This was first stated by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in 1742 in a letter to Goldbach in response to the earlier proposal by Goldbach that every number greater than 2 is a sum of three primes (Goldbach considered1 as a prime number). Goldbach’s conjecture, together with the weaker conjecture that every odd number iseither prime or the sum of three primes, was first published bytion. Both conjectures remain unsolved. However, Vino-waring [VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca) in 1770 but without attribugradov proved that every sufficiently large odd numberis the sum of three primes: see problems and results in additive number theory [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859).

such was the family’s importance that in 1715[VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) coined the term “bernoullizare” to describe the leibniz activity of doing mathematics. Altogether eight members of the family devoted themselves to the mathe-matical sciences (including physics, especially mechanics and fluid mechanics), and from 1687 to 1790 the mathematics chair of the university of Basel was occupied by successive members of the family: first Jacob (1687–1705), \text{then his brother Johann} (1705–48), and finally Johann’s son, Johann II (1748–90). Through out the eighteenth century Bernoullis were members of the Paris Academy of Sciences and individually they won prestigious prizes on many occasions.

The first Bernoullito settle in Basel was Jacob, a druggist, who became The family goes back to a line of Calvinist merchants a citizen in 1622. His grandson, Jacob I, studied phi-losophy and theology in Basel before turning to mathematics, against the will of his father.

Jacob computed these numbers up to B10. Johann, who had to study medicine before he could devote himself to mathematics, got his first mathe-matical training from his brother Jacob, with whom he developed numerous applications of the new Leib-nizian calculus to mechanics. An academic peregrination brought him to Paris in 1691–92, where he gave private lessons to Guillaume de l’Hôpital. These lessons are the basis of l’Hôpital’s famous Analyse des Infiniment Petitslus, contains l’Hôpital’s rule, which Johann had com-(1696).

In 1695, Johann left Basel for Groningen to take up a professorship in mathematics. friendly collaboration between the two brothers Jacob With the growing visibility of Johann’s work, the and Johann transformed into an endless round of con-troversies, priority disputes, and public accusations. They engaged in heated struggles concerning the solution of the brachistochrone (curve of fastest descent)problem, and a complicated isoperimetric problem that involved minimizing the area enclosed by a curve offixed length. Eventually, these bitter quarrels led to an interesting mathematical outcome: the creation of the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). After Jacob’s death, Johann took over the mathematics chair in Basel, wherehe taught until the end of his life, attracting students from all over Europe, including euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783). Johann’s most important achievement in mathematics is the development of the integral calculus. He devel-oped a general theory for the integration of rational functions and new methods for the solution of dif-ferential equations. He also extended the infinitesimal calculus to handle exponential functions [III.25](/part-03/the-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions).

Basel with his uncle Jacob before taking a degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence (1709). He was the professor Nicolaus I studied mathematics at the university of of mathematics in Padua, occupying the chair once heldby Galileo, and he later held the professorship of logic in Basel. His main interests in mathematics were infi-nite series and the applications of probability theory to questions of law. He formulated, in 1713, the notorious Saint Petersburg paradox, which originated witha gambling game. Suppose that Peter is tossing a fair coin, and he will give Paul one ducat if the coin turnsup heads on the first toss, two ducats if it shows heads for the first time on the second toss, and in general 2 n - 1\text{ducats if the coin turns up heads for the first time onthenth toss}. \text{The standard calculation shows that the} \text{value of Paul}’s expectation (1 2 n - 1 +· · ·) \text{is infinitely great}. \text{Nevertheless no} “fairly E =1 21 +1 42 +1 84 + · · · +reasonable man” would be willing to pay even a moder-2 n ately high price to purchase Paul’s prospects. The resultof the mathematical analysis clearly affronted common sense; this was the paradox. Nicolaus’s cousin, Daniel, discussed the problem while he was staying in Saint Petersburg (hence the name given to the paradox). His strategy was to distinguish two senses of expectation, one mathematical and the other moral. The latter was to take into account the individual characteristics ofthe risk taker (his wealth, for instance).

In 1747 d’Alembert dis-cussed various possibilities for solving the problem— an additional force, or a very irregular shape for the Moon, or some vortices between Earth and Moon—and produced a long study on celestial mechanics and planetary perturbations that has only recently been redis-covered and published (see d’Alembert 2002). By 1749 an improved mathematical analysis of the problem had shown that Newton’s theory was correct. The rest of d’Alembert’s extensive work on celestial mechanics was published in hisÉquinoxes (1749), Recherches sur Différents Points du Recherches sur la Précession des Système du Monde volumes of his Opuscules(1754–56), and in some of the eight(1761–83). problem of vibrating strings, que Forme une Corde Tendue Mise en Vibration In 1747 d’Alembert presented a paper on the famous Recherches sur la Courbe(1749).

This is a typical example of Lagrange’s reductionist style. Through out his career he sought suitable for-malisms with which to express and solve the key problems of mathematical analysis.Lagrange publicly presented hisδ-formalism in a memoir published in the second volume (1760–61) of Miscellanea Taurinensia, a review he had helped to found. He coupled this memoir with another in whichhe used the same formalism to formulate a generalized version of the principle of least action (previously intro-duced by Maupertuis and Euler). As a result, he was able to derive the equations of motion of any system of dis-tinct bodies attracted by central forces depending on the distances from their centers. ne ns i a sent ing a new approach to the problem of the vibrating Meanwhile, in the first volume of(1759), Lagrange had published a memoir pre-Miscellanea Tauristring, where the string is first represented as a dis-crete system ofn particles, and n is then allowed to tend to infinity. Using this method Lagrange argued that Euler was right to allow a large class of “func-tions,” both “continuous” and “discontinuous,” as solutions of this problem, whereas maintained that only “continuous functions” (that is, d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) had curves expressed by a single equation) could count assolutions. foundations of classical mechanics in these memoirs.It was based on the interpretation of a continuous Lagrange established a very general program in the system as a limiting case of a discrete one and theuse of the method of indeterminate coefficients: supposing that fic i en ts a (i P (x)= 0, . . . , nis a polynomial in) depend on some indetermi-x, whose coef-i

nates, and that P (x) = 0 for all x (in a given interval), this method consists of deducing the system of equa-tions${a = 0}^{i}=^{n}$, from which the indeterminates are possibly determined. Lagrange extended this methodto sums of polynomials in several (independent) vari-$i^{i} = 0$ ables, and (following Euler, d’Alembert, and many oth-ers) also used it with respect to power series. This program was further elaborated in two memoirs on themotion of the Moon (1764, 1780), and later realized in the Méchanique Analitique (1788). Here, the principle

of least action was replaced by a generalization of the Bernoullian principle of “virtual velocities,” which were expressed by variations. Using what are now known as generalized coordinates,φ (that is, mutually indepen-i

His methods were further developed by laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827) in his Mécanique Céleste and formed the basis for subsequent mathematical work in physical astronomy. The method of indeterminate coefficients, or rather its extension to power series, is also the crucial tech-nique underlying Lagrange’s approach to the calculus. In a memoir which appeared in the Berlin Academy (1768) he used it to prove an important Proceedings of the result connecting the calculus to the theory of algebraic equations, the so-called Lagrange inversion theorem, which states that a functionψ(p) of a root p of an equationt - x + φ(x) = 0, where φ(x) \text{is an arbitrary} function of Taylor expansions ofx, can be expanded in a series based on theφ(t) and ψ(t) (the precise con- ditions to be satisfied byclarified by cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) and Roché).x, φ(x), and ψ(t) were later series and proved that if a function power-series expansion in In a memoir of 1772 Lagrange returned to powerh, then this series can bef (x + h) has a written in the form\infty f(i)(x) hi, i!

a function is its Taylor series. Intions Analytiques (1797) he then showed (or, rather, Théorie des Fonc claimed to have shown), without making an appeal tothe differential calculus, that any function$f (x + h) can$ be expanded in a power series, and suggested inter-preting the differential formalism as a formalism that applies to the coefficients of$h^{i}/i$! in such an expansion. In other words, he suggested defining the differential ratios of any order (that is, the ratios d$iy/dx^{i}$, wherey = f (x)) as derivative functions supplying these coef- ficients, whereas previously these had been thought ofas genuine ratios of differentials. He also proved that the remainder of a Taylor series could be written in theform now known as the Lagrange remainder. theory of algebraic equations were presented in a long The main results obtained by Lagrange within the memoir of 1770 and 1771 in which the formulas for solving equations of degree 2, 3, and 4 were obtained through an analysis of permutations of the roots.This work constituted the starting point for the later researches ofsame memoir Lagrange stated a particular but signif-abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and galois [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832).

least-squares rule of error by means of a linear regres-sion, and the laplacian [I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or potential function. Laplace developed the fields of celestial mechanics (the phrase was his coinage) and probability, and along theway the mathematics to service and advance them. For Laplace, celestial mechanics and probability were com-ple ment ary instruments that implemented a unified vision of a fully determined universe. Celestial mechanics vindicated the Newtonian system of the world. Prob-ability was the measure, not of the operations of chance in nature, for there are none, but of human ignoranceof causes, which was to be reduced to virtual certainty by calculation. The third reason for Laplace’s importance to the history of science was the mathematiza-tion of physics in the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Apart from a few formulations—speedof sound, capillary action, refractive indices of gases— his role there was that of instigator and patron rather than of major contributor.Laplace came up with the majority of the above concepts in a probabilistic context. The earliest hints ofthe method of solving difference, differential, and integral equations, later known as the Laplace transform, appeared in “Mémoire sur les suites” (1782 a), where Laplace introduced generating functions. Laplace considered generating functions to be the approach ofchoice in solving problems that involved the development of functions in series and evaluation of the sums. Years later, in composingabilités (1812), he subordinated all the analytical part Théorie Analytique des Probto the theory of generating functions and treated theentire subject as their field of application. In the early memoir, however, he emphasized what he expected to be their applicability to problems of nature.In an even earlier paper, “Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements” (1774), laplace stated the theorem permitting the analysis later termed bayesian [III.3](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). Unknown to Laplace, Thomas Bayes had arrived at the same theorem eleven years earlier but had not developed it. Laplace for his part proceeded, in further investigations over some thirty years, to develop inverse probability into the basis for statistical inference, philosophical causality, estimation of scientific error, quantification of the credibility of evi-dence, and optimal voting rules in the proceedings of legislative bodies and judicial panels. His initial attrac-tion to the approach was its applicability to human concerns. It was in the course of these papers, most notably “Mémoire sur les probabilités” (1780), that the word probability came to connote not merely the basic

753

quantity in the theory of games and chance but asubject in itself. paper on causality. The problem was to estimate the Laplace first addressed error theory in the above most appropriate mean value to be taken in a series of astronomical observations of the same phenomenon. He also determined how the limits of the error were related to the number of observations (“Mémoire sur les probabilités” above). In “Essai pour connaître la population du Royaume” (1783–91) Laplace turned to demo-graphic applications. In the absence of census data, one needed to determine the multiplier to be applied to thenumber of births at any one time in order to estimate the approximate size of a population. The specific problem Laplace solved was the size of the sample required for the probability of error to fall within given limits. Only twenty-five years later did he return to the subject, in the course of preparing the comprehensive Laplace then put probabilistic investigation aside.Théorie Analytique des Probabilitésproblem of determining the mean value from a large. In 1810 he returned to the number of observations, which he interpreted as the problem of the probability that the mean value falls within certain limits. He proved a law of large numbers, stating that if positive and negative errors in an indefi-nitely large number of observations are assumed to be equally possible, then their mean result converges to alimit in a precise way. From this analysis followed the least-squares law of error. A priority dispute over the discovery of that law was even then simmering between gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833). Traité de Mécanique Célestethe two part “Mémoire sur la Théorie de Jupiter et de In a long series of investigations brought together in(1799–1825, five volumes), Saturne” (1788) demonstrates the most famous of his findings in planetary astronomy. He established that the current acceleration in orbital motion of Jupiter andthe deceleration of Saturn are the reciprocal effects of their mutual gravitation, which are cyclical over many hundreds of years and not cumulative. From this and analysis of other phenomena that Laplace explored, it followed that the so-called secular inequalities of plan-etary motions are periodic over many centuries. Thus, they are not derogations from the law of gravity but evidence that its validity extended beyond the Sun–planet attractions that had been studied by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727). He was never able to prove, however, that lunar acceleration is self-correcting over time. The expansion known by Laplace’s name in the theory of determinants first appears in the background

754

of the Jupiter–Saturn memoir in an analysis of the eccentricities and inclinations of orbits, “Recherches sur le calcul intégral et sur le système du monde” (1776). Except for that, Laplace’s mathematical original-ity is less notable in his analysis of planetary motion than in his development of the theory of probability.More in evidence in his astronomical work is his motivational drive and his power and virtuosity in calculation, which may indeed have been more important through out his long career. Laplace was masterful in finding rapidly convergent series, in obtaining mathe-matical expressions incorporating terms to represent a multitude of physical phenomena, in justifying the neglect of in convenient quantities in order to reach solutions, and in giving the widest possible generality to his conclusions.The attraction exerted by a spheroid on an external or internal point proved to be mathematically the most fertile set of problems in Laplacian planetary astron-omy. In “Théorie des attractions des sphéroïdes et de la figure des planètes” (1785) Laplace employed dre polynomials [III.85](/part-03/special-functions) in a form later called laplace le gen functions. He also proved a theorem that stated that all ellipsoids with the same foci for their principal sections attract a given point with a force proportional to their masses. Laplace’s angles appear in his development ofthe equation for the attraction of a spheroid on a given point. Laplace used polar coordinates in this analy-sis. He transformed the equation into one in Cartesian coordinates in “Mémoire sur la théorie de l’anneau de Saturne” (1789). In 1828 George Green dubbed Poisson’s application of the formula to electrostatic and magnetic forces the potential function, the term used there after in classical physics.

Little in the book was new; while expanded editions appeared in 1808 and 1830, he had been quickly eclipsed on methods of proof by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) of the young Gauss.

Paris, 1830 Analysis; equations; heat theory Unusually for a mathematician, Fourier pursued a dis-tinguished nonmathematical career. He was a civilian member of General Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt (1798–1801), important enough for the First Consulto make him, in 1802, the Prefect of the département at Grenoble, a position which he held until Emperor Napoleon’s fall in the mid 1810 s. There after, Fourier moved to Paris, where he managed to establish himselfto the extent of being appointed a secrétaire perpétuel of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1822.The prefectureship involved heavy commitments, and Fourier was also active in Egyptology, most notably discovering a teenager named Jean Champollion in Grenoble, who was later to decipher the Rosetta Stone and who helped to found the discipline. Nevertheless, between 1804 and 1815 he also created most of his scientific work. His motivation was the mathematical study of the diffusion of heat in continuous and solid bodies; his “diffusion equation” for this purpose wasnot only novel in itself but also marked the first largescale mathematization of physical phenomena that lay out side mechanics. To solve this differential equation he proposed using infinite trigonometric series. These series were already known but had a low status. Fourier (re)found many properties: not only the formulas for their coefficients and some conditions for their conver-gence but especially their represent ability, namely, how a periodic series could represent a general function.

fifteen, when the duke paid for his further education, lifting him out of near poverty. For the rest of his life Gauss felt a loyalty to the state and a strong desire to do useful work, which led him to become a pro-fessional astronomer. In 1801 he was the first person to manage to reobserve Ceres, the first asteroid to be discovered, after it had disappeared behind the Sun. Gauss produced a novel statistical analysis of the original observations, using the method of least squares, which he had invented but not published, to predict where Ceres would reappear. Gauss then assisted formany years in the analysis of the orbits of several more asteroids. He also wrote extensively on celestial mechanics and cartography, and did important workon telegraphy. will always be remembered. In 1801 he published his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae Nonetheless, it is as a pure mathematician that Gauss, the book that created modern algebraic number theory. In it he gave the first rigorous proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871), going on to find seven more proofs over theyears. Later he extended the theorem to higher powers, introducing the Gaussian integers for the purpose in 1831 (Gaussian integers are numbers of the formm + ni, where m and n are integers and i = \sqrt{-1}). He did major work on differential equations, chiefly the hypergeometric equation, which is a second-order linear differential equation depending on three parameters and having two singular points, with the prop-erty that many of the familiar functions of analysis are related to its solutions. He showed that this equation played a significant role in the new theory of elliptic functions [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), but because most of this work was unpublished it had no influence on the dramatic and rapidly advancing publications of abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) and jacobiwas the first mathematician to see the need to create[VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851). This unpublished work showed that he a theory of complex functions of a complex variable. He also gave four proofs oforem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra).

b. Pithiviers, France, 1781; d. Paris, 1840 Analysis; mechanics; mathematical physics; probability A brilliant graduate of the École Polytechnique in 1800, Poisson was quickly appointed to the staff, and became professor and graduation examiner there until hisdeath. He was also founder professor of mechanics at the new Paris Faculté des Sciences of the Universitéde France; from 1830 he was also a member of the governing Council of the Université.Poisson’s research output was dominated by his adherence to the traditions established by[VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813) and laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827). Like Lagrange he pre-lagrange ferred to algebraize theories, and to rely if possible upon power series and variational methods. From the mid 1810 s he challenged the new theories of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (especially the solving of differential equationsby trigonometric series and the Fourier integral) and ofanalysis using limits, and his innovation of complex-cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) (the new approach to real-variable variable analysis). His overall achievements were muchless significant than theirs: the main novelties were the “Poisson integral,” which embedded Fourier series within a power series; and a summation formula. He also studied the general and singular solutions of differential, difference, and mixed equations. that all physical phenomena were molecular, and thatthe cumulative action upon a molecule of all its com-In physics Poisson tried to justify Laplace’s claim panions should be expressed mathematically in termsof an integral. He applied this approach to heat diffusion and to elasticity theory by the mid 1820 s, butthen decided that integrals should be replaced by sums; he elaborated this alternative especially in capillary theory (1831). Curiously, molecularism did not dominate his most important contributions to physics: to electrostatics (1812–14) and to magnetic bodies and the process of magnetization (1824–27). His mathemat-ical contributions to these topics included modifying Laplace’s equation to what we now call Poisson’s equa-tion, which deals with the potential at points inside a charged body or region of charge (1814); and also adivergence theorem (1826).

Lagrange developed the brackets theory (named afterthem) of canonical solutions to the equations of mo-In mechanics, between 1808 and 1810 Poisson and tion. Poisson’s motivation was to extend, to second-order terms in masses of the planets, Lagrange’s superb attempt to prove that the planetary system was sta-ble; in later work he examined this (first-order) problem specifically, as well as other aspects of perturbation theory. He also analyzed rotating bodies by using moving frames of reference (1839), in an analysis that was to inspire Léon Foucault to propose his famous long pendulum in 1851. His best-known publications include a substantial and wide-ranging two-volume Traité de Mécanique (editions in 1811 and 1833), which did not, however, have room for Louis Poinsot’s beau-tiful recent theory (1803) of the couple in statics. In the mid 1810 s, he studied deep-body fluid dynamics, in rivalry with Cauchy. Poisson was one of the few contemporaries to take up Laplace’s work in probability theory and mathe-matical statistics. He studied various probability distributions(1837, rather in passing) but also the so-called Cauchy[III.71](/part-03/probability-distributions): not only the one named after him (1824) and Rayleigh (1830) distributions. He also examined proofs of theand formulated the law of large numbers central limit theorem [III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions),[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) (his term). One of his main applications was to the old problem of determining the probability that a triad of judges would come to the correct decision in court cases (1837).

The value(nonempty) set of numbers with the property not-u in this formulation is a lower bound for the M. Bolzano’s lemma is therefore equivalent to what nowadays might be called the “greatest lower bound” axiom(or, more commonly and equivalently, the “least upper bound” axiom). It is also equivalent to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (that every bounded infinite set in R, or more generally Rn, has an accumulation point).

He showed in this way how points can be described by a homogeneous triple of coordin-ates, lines can be described by linear equations, the concept of cross-ratio can be introduced, and the dualityof points and lines in the plane can be handled algebraically. He also introduced a Möbius net, which is the projective equivalent of squared paper in cartesian geometry. His work is all the more remarkable because Möbius knew very little of Poncelet’s radical reinven-tion of projective geometry only a few years before. In its turn his work was for a time overshadowed by Jakob Steiner’s synthetic treatment of projective geometry of 1832, and then Plücker’s two books on algebraic curves in the 1830 s, but the simplicity and generality of Möbius’s methods were important in establishing projective geometry as a rigorous mainstream subject. In the 1830 s Möbius developed a geometrical theory of statics and the composition of forces, and it was inthis connection that he showed that whereas duality in plane geometry necessarily gives rise to a conic, duality in space need not. Möbius’s study of duality in space, which pairs points with planes, led him to consider the set of all lines in space, which is a four-dimensional space. It pleased the educator Rudolf Steiner very much that the ordinary three-dimensional space may also be thought of as a four-dimensional space, because Steiner’s philosophy was directed against breaking what he saw as a stranglehold of orthodox teaching.

The university had just appointed Martin Bartels as Professor of Mathematics, and Bar-tels not only trained Lobachevskii well, but protected him from trouble with the authorities when Lobachev-skii was suspected of atheism. Eventually, Lobachevskii graduated not with the ordinary degree but with a Master’s qualification, and his career as a professional mathematician began.In 1826, after a reform of the university, Lobachevskii gave a public lecture: “On the principles of geom-etry, with a rigorous demonstration of the theory of parallels.” The manuscript of this talk is now lost, butit probably marked the start of Lobachevskii’s awareness of a non-Euclidean geometry.

Loba-chevskii called these the parallels to the given line through the given point. Starting from this definition, he gave formulas for the new trigonometry of triangles, and showed that these formulas reduce to the famil-iar formulas of plane Euclidean trigonometry when the triangles are very small. He extended his results todescribe a geometry of three dimensions, thus making it clear that his new geometry could be a geom-etry of space, and attempted, inconclusively, to measure the parallax of stars in order to determine whether his imaginary geometry gave a more accurate account of space than Euclidean geometry.He published these conclusions in lengthy papers in Russian in the Journal of Kazan University, but they drew only a relentlessly hostile review from Ostro-gradskii, a much better known mathematician in Saint Petersburg.

From). \text{Almost all of Abel}’s \text{mathematical work was pub}1826 \text{until his death in} 1829 \text{Abel eked out a poor existence}, \text{earning a little by teaching}, \text{but using whatfew resources he had to support his mother and his younger brother}. \text{He died of consumption at the ageof twenty}-\text{seven within a couple of days of the news reaching Norway that he had been appointed to an established post in Berlin}.Abel’s \text{main mathematical contributions lie in three distinct areas}. \text{The first of these was the theory of equa} - tions. \text{Here he was influenced by ideas published by lagrange} [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813) in 1770 \text{and cauchy} [VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) in 1815 \text{about the form of functions of the roots of an equa} - tion, \text{and what happens to such functions when the roots are permuted}. \text{Lagrange had hinted at the possi}-\text{bility that quintic equations might perhaps not be soluble in classical terms and Paolo Ruffini had expended much effort between} 1799 and 1814 \text{trying to provethis}, \text{though he had not managed to persuade his} \text{contemporaries}. Abel’s \text{first success was to give an accept}-\text{able proof of the fact that}, \text{for polynomial equations of degree} 5, \text{there is no formula in the coefficients involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with extraction of roots that will always yield a solution}. \text{This first appeared in} 1824 \text{in a short pamphlet writtenin French and published privately in Christiania} (Oslo). \text{Once Abel reached Berlin}, however, \text{Crelle translated itinto German and published it in the first volume of his journal}; \text{he also published a fuller}, \text{more detailed account}, \text{covering polynomials of any degree greater than} 4, in 1826.\text{Abel returned to equations a few years later}, \text{publishing a long paper in} 1829 \text{about a class of equations satisfying two special conditions}. \text{His first requirement is that every root of the equation can be expressed as afunction of every other root}, \text{the second that these functions commute} (\text{in modern terms}, the[V.21](/part - 05/the - insolubility - of - the - quintic) \text{of the equation is commutative}). \text{He proved var}-\text{galois group ious theorems about such equations}, \text{the most striking} 761 \text{being that they are soluble by radicals}. \text{This represented an extensive} \text{generalization} \text{of the ideas described by gauss met ic ae}[VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855) \text{in the seventh part of}, \text{where the special case of cyclotomic equations} \text{Disquisitiones} Arith(\text{which satisfy both of these conditions}) \text{is treated sys} - tematically. \text{It was in honour of this work that}, later, \text{the adjective} “Abelian” \text{was applied to groups that are commutative}. \text{It is important to appreciate}, however, \text{that Abel reached his results in the theory of equations without any appeal to groups}, \text{which at that time werenot yet known}. convergence. \text{Although there had been over a centuryof critical thinking devoted to foundations of the cal}-\text{He also made major contributions to the theory of culus}, \text{modern ideas of rigour were only just emerg}-\text{ing in the writings of bolzano} [VI.28](/part - 06/bernard - bolzano - 17811848), Cauchy, \text{and others}. \text{Convergence had received some attention in Cauchy}’s \text{lectures of} 1820–21, \text{but series in general}, \text{and power series in particular}, \text{were still far from well understood}. \text{Among other contributions}, \text{Abel offereda proper proof of the binomial theorem for exponents other than positive integers}, \text{and the insight about the continuity of a function defined by a power series as its argument goes to the circle of convergence that is now known as Abel}’s \text{limit theorem}.\text{Perhaps his greatest discoveries}, however, \text{were in the area where analysis and algebraic geometry come together}. \text{To summarize his legacy in this area in just a few words}: first, \text{a new and productive approach to the theory ofa vast} \text{generalization} \text{of elliptic functions to what are elliptic functions} [V.31](/part - 05/the - riemannroch - theorem); and, second, \text{now called Abelian functions and Abelian integrals}. \text{Inthis area Abel competed for priority with jacobi} [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851). Most (\text{though by no means all}) \text{of his work was written in two memoirs}. \text{One was published in two parts},“\text{Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques}” and “Précis d’\text{une th}é\text{orie des fonctions elliptiques},” \text{coming to wellover two hundred pages in Crelle}’s \text{Journal in} 1828 and 1829. \text{The other}, entitled “Mé\text{moire sur une propri}été générale d’\text{une classe tr}ès é\text{tendue de fonctions tran} - scendantes,” \text{was submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in October} 1826. \text{There it lay on Cauchy}’s desk, \text{unread until after Abel}’s death. \text{It was published by the Paris Academy in} 1841. \text{The manuscript itself}, however, \text{was stolen by} G.

many prime numbers. In two subsequent papers, pub-lished in 1838 and 1839, he used his new methods, among other things, to determine the formula of the class number of binary quadratic forms: that is, thenumber of proper classes of forms of given determinant. It is often said that these three papers mark thestart of analytic number theory [IV.2](/part-04/number-theory). Dirichlet also made important contributions to algebraic number theory, culminating in hisrem [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) for the Abelian group of units in an alge-unit theobraic number field. These contributions, together with numerous others due to him (e.g., his Sc hu bf a ch pr inz ip, or box principle; work on the law of biquadratic reciprocity; and results concerning Gaussian sums), were brought together in his influential Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie by his former student(lectures on number theory), \text{published dedekind} [VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in 1863. \text{Inspired by his close contact with fourier} [VI.25](/part - 06/jean - baptiste - joseph - fourier - 17681830) \text{during his student days in Paris}, Dirichlet’s \text{other main interests were in analysis and mathematical physics}, \text{and in the connections between them}. \text{In a ground}-\text{breaking paper of} 1829, \text{Dirichlet not only gave the first strict proof of the convergence of a Fourier series under given conditions}, \text{but he also used new methods and concepts} (e.g., \text{his insight into the importance of conditional convergence of series}; \text{his Dirichlet function influencing the development of the concept of a function}) \text{that became classic and that served as a basis for countless nineteenth} - century \text{investigations} \text{on analy} - sis. \text{He also occupied himself with the determination of multiple integrals as well as with the expansion ofa function into spherical functions} (\text{Kugelfunktionen}) \text{and applied these results to problems in mathematical physics}. \text{His main contributions to mathematical physics include papers on the theory of heat}, hydrodynamics, \text{the gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid}, the$n$-\text{body problem}, \text{and potential theory}. \text{The first boundary}-\text{value problem} (the “\text{Dirichlet problem}” \text{of finding the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region}) \text{had already been handled by Fourier and others}, \text{but Dirichlet proved the uniqueness of the solution}, \text{while the dirichlet principle ing boundary problems for}[IV.12 §3.5](/part - 04/analysis) (\text{a method for solv}-\text{elliptic partial differential equations ational problems}[IV.12 §2.5](/part - 04/analysis) \text{by reducing them to}[III.94](/part - 03/variational - methods)) \text{was introduced by him in var i lectures on potential theory}, \text{enhancing a method introduced by Gauss}. \text{Connected with Dirichlet}’s \text{work onanalysis was his contribution to probability and error VI}.38. \text{Augustus De Morgan theory}, \text{in particular his development of new methods for probabilistic limit theorems}. \text{mathematics by his mathematical style}, \text{by the exact}-\text{Dirichlet also influenced the further development of ness and elegance of his proofs}, \text{and by his teaching}.\text{Together with his friend jacobi} [VI.35](/part - 06/carl - gustav - jacob - jacobi - 18041851), \text{he ushered in a new epoch of mathematical teaching at german universities by introducing lectures and seminars on the most recent research}, \text{and with him began thegolden age of mathematics in Berlin}. \text{Although Dirichlet did not found his own mathematical school}, \text{his influence can be found in the work of Dedekind}, Eisen - stein, kronecker [VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), \text{and riemann} [VI.49], \text{among others}. \text{Further Reading Butzer}, P.-L., M.

In July 1829, after his father’s sui-cide, Galois was again rejected by the École Polytechnique. He entered the École Préparatoire (later known asthe École Normale Supérieure) in October 1829 but was expelled in December 1830 for unacceptable behaviour arising from political disagreements with the authori-ties. Arrested on Bastille Day (14 July) 1831, he spent the next eight months in prison for flouting authority again. He emerged at the end of April 1832 but somehow got himself challenged to a duel. On 29 May he edited his manuscripts and wrote a summary of his dis-coveries in a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The duel took place the next morning and he died on 31 May1832. Much has been written about him. But a man who dies so young leaves little real evidence for historians to work with, however rich his story, and most of his biographers have allowed romantic invention to colour their accounts of his life. cal works (and a number of smaller and less important There are four main papers in Galois’s mathemat i items). The first to be published was “Sur la théorie des nombres,” which appeared in April 1830 and contains the theory of Galois fields. These are analogues of the complex numbers obtained by adjoining to the integers modulo a prime numberp a root of an irreducible poly- nomial congruence moduloof the basic features of what later became the theory ofp. The paper contains most finite fields.In the letter to Chevalier written on the eve of the duel, Galois mentions three memoirs. The first, now known as thetled “Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations Premier Mémoire, is a manuscript entipar radicaux.” Galois submitted work on the theory ofequations to the Paris Academy on 25 May and 1 June 1829, but this is now lost and it seems quite possible that Galois withdrew it on the advice of Cauchy (towhom it had been given to referee) in January 1830. In February 1830 he resubmitted his work in compe-tition for the Grand Prix de Mathématiques, but his manuscript was unfortunately and mysteriously loston the death of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) (and the prize was awarded jointly tojacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851)).

His ideas led directly to “abstract algebra” (see [II.3 §6](/part-02/abstract-algebra-development)): when the abstract notion of field developed later in the nineteenth century, it turned out that most of the theory of finite fieldshad already been anticipated in that first paper; Galois theory developed directly out of the material in the Premier Mémoire; and the theory of groups developed from the ideas in the Mémoire together with a series of papers published by Premier Mémoire and the Second Cauchy in 1845.

compete for positions at England’s Anglican universi-ties. This effectively forced him down a convoluted path toward his personal goal of a career as a research mathematician. He worked as an actuary in London in the1840 s and 1850 s before qualifying as a lawyer by passing the English Bar. He was unemployed for some sixyears in the 1870 s, but held professorships at various times, both of natural philosophy and of mathemat-ics, in England and in the United States. Most notably, Sylvester served as the first Professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1876 to 1883 and, thanks to an 1871 law that finally made it possible for non-Anglicans to hold professorships at Oxbridge, was eligible for and won the appointment as Oxford’s Savilian Professor of Geom-etry in 1883. He held the Oxford chair until ill health forced his retirement in 1894. The program sylvester set up at Johns Hopkins established his pivotal place in the history of American research-level mathematics, while his mathematical accomplishments had garnered him an international reputation as early as the 1860 s. with work on the problem of determining when two polynomial equations have a common root. This nat-Sylvester entered the research arena in the late 1830 s urally led not only to questions in the theory of determinants but also to an explicit, pioneering, and self-consciously algebraic analysis of the intermediate expressions that arise in Charles François Sturm’s algorithm for determining the number of real roots of a polynomial equation that lie between two given real numbers (1839, 1840). Sylvester followed this up with what he called the dialytic method of elimination: a new criterion in terms of determinants [III.15](/part-03/determinants) for detecting whether two polynomial equations have a common root (1841).His next major research push came in the 1850 s when, together with theory of invariants. This involved an associated andcayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), he formulated a slightly more general theory of “covariants.” More concretely, given a binary form of a particular degree, Sylvester and Cayley devised techniques both for explicitly finding invariants and covariants of that formand for determining algebraic relations, or “syzygies,” between them. Sylvester tackled these questions in two important papers: “On the principles of the calculus offorms” (1852) and “On a theory of the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions” (1853). In thelatter, he proved, among other results, Sylvester’s law of inertia: if$Q(x^{1}$, . . . , xn) is a real quadratic form [III.73](/part-03/quadratic-forms) of rankr , then there exists a (real) nonsingular

However, he then entered a fallow period that ended only with his move to Baltimore. While there, he returned to invariant theory, and specifically to the problem of inductively determining, for binary forms first of degree 2 then of degree 3 then of degree 4, etc., the number of covariants in a minimum generating set associated with the form. In 1868, Paul Gordanhad proved that this number is always finite and, in so doing, had proved wrong an earlier result of Cayley, who claimed to have shown that a minimum generating set of covariants for the binary quintic form (that is, thebinary form of degree 5) was infinite. By 1879, Sylvester had explicitly calculated minimum generating sets of covariants associated with binary forms of degrees two through ten. He had also succeeded in recognizing and filling (1878) a critical gap in the proof that Cayley had given of a theorem on the maximal number of linearly independent covariants associated with a binary form of any given degree.Sylvester was the founding editor of the American Journal of Mathematics, and indeed much of this invariant-theoretic work, as well as results on partitions(1882), on rational points on a cubic curve (1879–80), and on matrix algebras (1884), appeared there.

was a poor shoemaker who was more interested inbuilding telescopes and scientific instruments than making shoes—the result being that his business failed and Boole had to leave school at the age of fourteen and take a job as a junior teacher to support his parents, sister, and two brothers. By the age of ten he had mastered Latin and Ancient Greek, and by the age of sixteen he could read and speak French, Italian, Span-ish, and German fluently. From his father he got a love of mechanics, physics, geometry, and astronomy, and together they built functioning scientific instruments. Boole then turned to mathematics and by the age oftwenty he was publishing original research in calculus and linear systems. He wrote two seminal papers on linear transformations (1841, 1843), which provided the starting point for invariant theory, but he left it to others such asto develop the subject. In 1844 he was awarded thecayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895) and sylvester [VI.42](/part-06/james-joseph-sylvester-18141897) Royal Society’s Gold Medal for his paper on operators in analysis, the first gold medal for mathemat-ics to be presented by the society. The paper was important not only because it contained (arguably forthe first time) a clear definition of the concept of an operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), but also because of the influence it had on Boole’s subsequent ideas. An operator, for Boole, was an operation of the calculus, such as differentiation (which he denoted by D), considered as anobject in its own right. There was an explicit similarity between the laws he derived for functions of D and the laws of his algebra of logic, which we shall discuss below. man but family circumstances prevented this.
