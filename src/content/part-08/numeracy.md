were two key factors in the rapid rise in numerical competence in the early nineteenth-century United States. It was not that people suddenly became smarter. On the one hand, the decimalization of money in the late eighteenth century meant that at last accountants, shopkeepers, and business owners were working with a single number base.
At the same time, a new educational movement forsook the rote learning of arithmetical rules, applied mechanically to particular situations, for inductive instruction that encouraged pupils to calculate with fingers and counters, and in their heads, before they progressed to pen and paper. In this way some basic structural impediments were removed, both to the learning of number relationships, and to their application in commercial life. Because modern decimal notation is a calculating system as well as a recording device, it is easily forgotten that other methods are just as effective.
Indeed, for most communities, most of the time, numerals were simply a means to record the out come of operations performed on the body or with other calculating tools. Finger counting and abacus use remained ubiquitous in the medieval Islamic world and Christian Europe long after knowledge of decimal numerals, together with al-khwārizmı̄’s [VI.5](/part-06/abu-jafar-muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizm-vi55-william-kingdon-cliord-18451879) treatise on how to use them, and cheap paper on which to write them, began to spread outward from Baghdad in the ninth century c.e.
Their retention was not a knee-jerk reaction in the face of an overwhelmingly superior technology; rather, it took into account such factors as portability, speed of use, and a long-established trust in and institutional sanction of the old methods. Indeed, it is difficult to over estimate just how old abacus calculation is. Reviel Netz identifies two evolutionary prerequisites for what he calls “counter culture,” by which he means the uniquely and ubiquitously human use of small objects to represent other objects that are being counted, in one-one or one-many relationships.
One is physiological: one needs to be able to pick up and manipulate small objects such as pebbles or shells. All primates share this ability thanks to prehensile fingers and opposable thumbs. The other is cognitive: one must be able to subitize, or recognize the size of a small set of up to about seven objects, with out counting them individually.
Stringed-bead abacuses exploit this most obviously, whether in the Russian-style tenbead variety, whose fifth and sixth beads are always a different color from the others, or in the Japanese version, whose strings contain just four unit-beads and one five-bead each.

VIII. Final Perspectives

But, as Netz so powerfully puts it, “The abacus is not an artefact: it is a state of mind.” All one needs is a flat surface and a pile of small objects to act as counters. This extreme ephemerality makes the use of abacuses almost impossible to detect in the archaeological record, except in the rare cases where abacus counters can be recognized as such. Denise Schmandt-Besserat has argued that a sophisticated accounting system was developed in the Neolithic Middle East from the ninth millennium b.c.e.
She proposes that the tiny, unbaked pieces of clay, crudely shaped into various simple geometrical figures and found in preliterate archaeological contexts from eastern Turkey to Iran, are ancient accounting tokens. It is certainly true that the earliest written numerals in the area, from southern Iraq in the late fourth millennium b.c.e., are marks on clay tablets that look remarkably like stylized impressions of such objects, and are visually distinct from the signs for the objects that were being counted, which were scratched onto the clay rather than impressed.
It is also true that these earliest written records are almost exclusively accounting records, drawn up by temple administrators in the management of assets such as land, labor, and agricultural products. And from the fifth millennium b.c.e. onward, those tiny clay tokens are found in archaeological contexts--sealed into jars, for instance, or wrapped in little clay bundles, or carefully piled in the corners of storerooms--that are entirely compatible with their use as abacus counters.
But Schmandt Besserat’s claim for a universally standardized system across the Middle East from several millennia before then is not provable: there is no way of establishing that they were not some times gaming pieces, for instance, or sling shot, or any number of other possibilities, and certainly no way of determining what specific shapes signified and to whom. In fact, ad hoc means of counting and measuring are still everyday occurrences in all our lives, even among those with a high level of formal mathematics education.

One participant, who had taken a calculus course at college, was asked to modify a recipe calling for two-thirds of a cup of cottage cheese so that it contained three-quarters of that amount. Lave recalls: “He filled a measuring cup two thirds full of cottage cheese, dumped it out on a cutting board, patted it into a circle, marked a cross on it,

scooped away one quadrant, and served the rest.” She comments: Thus, “take three-quarters of two-thirds of a cup of cottage cheese” was not just the problem statement but also the solution to the problem and the procedure for solving it. The setting was part of the calculating process and the solution was simply the problem statement enacted within the setting. At no time did the Weight Watcher check his procedure against a paper and pencil algorithm, which would have pro$321$

duced ${}^{4} \times {}^{3} = {}^{2}$ cup. Instead, the coincidence of problem, setting, and enactment was the means by which checking took place. In other words, there are many situations in many people’s lives in which potentially applicable literate, school-taught mathematical procedures are ignored in favor of equally effective nonliterate ones that produce the correct result with the tools at hand. Numeracy takes many forms, not all of which entail writing.

Measurement and Control

The Weight Watcher invented a system of cottagecheese measurement that satisfied him in its accuracy and fulfilled his immediate culinary needs. But as individuals and social groups we also accept the accuracy and consistency of standardized measurement systems, and the institutional necessity of counting and measuring particular things but not others. Theodore Porter has written eloquently of the twentieth century’s growing “trust in numbers,” whether of census statistics or environmental data.
But institutionally sanctioned quantification is often contested, and it frequently alters the very phenomenon that is being pinned down. Cohen’s description of nineteenth century North America is more generally apposite: What people chose to count and measure reveals not only what was important to them but what they wanted to understand and, often, what they wanted to control. Further, how people counted and measured reveals underlying assumptions about the subject under study, assumptions ranging from plain old bias ... to ideas about the structure of society and of knowledge.
In some cases, the activity of counting and measuring itself altered the way people thought about what they were quantifying: numeracy could be an agent of change. Cohen and Porter both explore problems raised by early nineteenth-century census taking. Porter describes the obstacles that the under-resourced Bureau

$987$

de Statistique faced in obtaining accurate population data in post-revolutionary France. With out resorting to the old class categorizations of the ancien régime, it needed to acknowledge the huge diversity of occupations and social structures across the country. To do so it relied on local officials to return a mass of quantitative data that was simply not readily available--and so the prefectures commissioned qualitative descriptions of their regions instead. As Porter puts it, in 1800 “France was not yet capable of being reduced to statistics.” Cohen analyzes the U.S.
Census of 1840 , which appeared to demonstrate a much higher rate of insanity among the black population in the abolitionist northern states than in the south. Pro-slavery factions took this as irrefutable evidence that slavery suited the black population much better than freedom did; abolitionists queried the trustworthiness of the census itself. Whether or not one chose to believe the data was more or less a matter of what one’s preexisting political convictions were.
As Cohen shows, the source of the error lay in clumsily designed recording sheets, in which the “idiot white” and “idiot black” columns were easily confused, resulting in the misrecording of many elderly senile inhabitants of all-white households. In the $1840s$ , however, the public debate was not about methodology, but whether fraud had been committed: the numbers themselves could not lie.
Two thousand years earlier, as Serafina Cuomo has shown, the Roman land survey or Frontinus opined that the world was essentially unknowable with out quantitative intervention, and that the trustworthiness of that measure was dependent on professional expertise: The basis of the art of measuring lies in the experience of the agent.
It is in fact impossible to express the truth of the places or of the size with out calculable lines, because the wavy and uneven edge of any piece of land is enclosed by a boundary which, because of the great quantity of unequal angles, can be contracted or expanded, even when their number [that is, the number of the angles] remains the same. Indeed pieces of land which are not finally demarcated have a fluctuating space and an uncertain determination of iugera.
The natural world is problematically irregular, Frontinus believed, and must be disciplined into quantified straight lines--and, ideally, marked out into grids of 2400 foot squares (iugera) -- in order to be brought under control. The Roman reshaping of the landscape through its quantification is still visible through out

$988$

Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa today, both on land and from the air. The Incas, by contrast, brought time, space, society, and the gods under control through radial lines in the landscape, tied to the ceremonial year. Before Spanish-led Christian ization in the sixteenth-century, the heart of the Inca cosmos was the sacred city of Cuzco in the Peruvian Andes. The Incas divided the world into unequal quarters or tawantinsuyu “the four parts together,” radiating out from the Temple of the Sun.
Through each suyu ran nine to fourteen ceque paths through the mountains, forty-one in total, with an average of eight huaca shrines stationed on each. The local inhabitants performed a ritual at one of the $328$ huacas every day of the sacred year (composed of twelve months of $27\frac{1}{3}$ days). Thus the religious focus of the Inca state moved systematically around its territory, day by day and from community to community, binding every social group into the same calendar, cult, and cosmos. Numeracy, then, is a powerful institutional tool:
measuring, quantifying, and classifying can transform an unknowable mass of individual people, places, or things into manageable categories of known entities; in turn, this institutionally imposed structure shapes the self-identities of those being managed. Institutional numeracy, while imposed from above, is always dependent to some degree on community-wide support and cooperation, if not necessarily for the objects of account then always for the counters.
Attempts at censuses in the eighteenth century did not fail because people refused to be reduced to numbers in boxes, but because those charged with collecting the data had neither the infrastructural means to do so nor an intellectual out look that valued quantification. Inca and Roman societies, by contrast, were able to produce whole classes of the professionally numerate who did.

Numeracy and Gender

In modern anglophone culture, academic mathematics is popularly considered a male pursuit--and women supposedly have to subordinate or compromise their femininity if they are to succeed in it. But such perceptions are far from universal: studies collected by Barbro Grevholm and Gila Hanna, for instance, show that in the early $1990s$ some $80$ % of Kuwaiti and over half of Portuguese undergraduate mathematics majors were women. However, as the following examples demonstrate, this has more to do with how particular societies

VIII. Final Perspectives

construct ideals of femininity and masculinity and with what they count as mathematical activity than with any intrinsically gendered properties of mathematics itself. For most of the second millennium b.c.e., Babylonian scribes understood professional numeracy to be a divine gift--not from the gods in general but from a handful of powerful goddesses. In the literary works that scribal students memorized as part of their professional training, creator gods bestowed land-measuring equipment and numeracy on those goddesses to enable them to manage household estates equitably.
In a myth now known as Enki and the World Order the great god Enki announces: My illustrious sister, holy Nisaba, Is to receive the $1$ - rod measuring reed. The lapis lazuli rope is to hang from her arm. She is to proclaim all the great divine powers. She is to fix boundaries and mark borders. She is to be the scribe of the Land. The gods’ eating and drinking are to be in her hands. The scribes’ literary works also portrayed Nisaba as the patron of institutional numeracy in the real world: she in turn provided mensuration tools to scribes and kings to enable them to uphold justice in society.
 Another scholastic literary genre was the scribal dialogue, in which the protagonists argue over the ideals of scribal professionalism. In one such debate the young scribe Enki-manshum explicitly relates metrological competence to social justice: When I go to divide a plot, I can divide it; when I go to apportion a field, I can apportion the pieces, So that when wronged men have a quarrel I soothe their hearts and ... . Brother will be at peace with brother, their hearts ... . This was not merely a literary trope:
law codes promulgated by real-life Babylonian kings often began with prologues claiming that they would uphold fairness in commercial measuring, weighing, and counting, and included provisions for punishing metrological fraud. Many hundreds of legal records survive, at testing to the settlement of land disputes through accurate professional measurement and calculation. In the nineteenth century b.c.e. city of Sippar, the judges who held court in the temple of Shamash, god of justice, employed female scribes and surveyors as well as male (often

Numeracy

from the same families). Further, the personal seals of fourteenth-century b.c.e. royal land surveyors were often dedicated to Nin-sumun, the divine mother of the legendary hero Gilgamesh: for them the numerate goddess who bestows numerate justice was no school story but at the very heart of their professional self-identity. In ancient Babylonia, then, numeracy and metrology gained institutional authority and power as much through association with divine femininity as with royal masculinity.
Many modern societies, by contrast, defeminize numerate thought and activity by denying its mathematical status when it is carried out by women. Gary Urton’s study of Quechua numeration started out as an ethnography of Bolivian weaving, which, he discovered, was based on highly intricate symmetrical patterns that the (female) weavers know by heart. They count off threads effortlessly, unerringly picking up where they have left off after interruptions to nurse babies, prepare food, or attend to other domestic matters.
And yet the men of the area categorically told Urton that the weavers “can’t count”--because when a woman sells her finished weavings at market she will invariably ask another woman of the group to check her takings to ensure that she has not been cheated. Urton was taught to weave by Irene Flores Condori, a twelve-year-old girl. He recalls: On one occasion, a stern old woman ... asked me point blank if, by weaving, I was trying to be like a woman. I answered by telling her that in some villages I know of, it is the men rather than the women who do the weaving. . . .
The old woman gave us both a wry look and asked, if that was the case, then is it the women in those villages who have the penises! Weaving was such a strongly gendered activity that this and other incidents led Urton to feel that “my behavior was being tolerated to the degree that it was only because, as an outsider, I was not subject to the same rules and expectations as local men.” Weaving is exclusively women’s work and therefore its intrinsically numerate character is socially invisible;
women are more reluctant than men to trust strangers to handle money fairly and are therefore considered innumerate. Mary Harris shows how a similarly powerful gender divide developed in Victorian Britain as primary education became available to an ever-widening section of the populace. Mathematics was regarded as the quintessential ly male school subject, while needlework was the epitome of femininity. Yet:

Every garment knitted to fit a particular body depends on the principle of ratio. Every pinafore pattern copied from a blackboard requires visual interpretation of scaling and the ability to draw a smooth curve. All the fine stitching that the early Inspectors were unable to tell from machine stitching depended on the ability to judge equal distances by eye and maintain them in a straight row.
In other words, wherever girls and women weave, knit, or sew they are unwittingly engaging numerate aptitudes and skills, often highly creatively, just as Molière’s Monsieur Jourdain had been speaking prose all his life “with out knowing anything about it.”

Numeracy and Literacy,

School and Supermarket

Perhaps one reason that women’s work is not often thought to belong to the realm of professional numeracy is that numeracy is so often considered (when it is considered at all) as a subset of literacy. As Reviel Netz puts it, With Arabic numerals, numbers appear as secondary to writing, benefiting from tools that were largely invented to record verbal systems and not numerical symbols. In broad historical perspective, this is the exception and not the rule.
The rule is that, across cultures, and especially in early cultures, the record and manipulation of visual symbols precede and predominate over the record and manipulation of verbal symbols. Netz is thinking here of counters and abacuses, but the Bolivian weavers remind us that numeracy does not have to entail symbolic manipulation at all. One may count threads, llamas, ideas, anything, and perform calculations with out the intervention of external tools. The use of fingers and other body parts has cropped up repeatedly in the examples presented in this essay.
Much of the weavers’ mental work is so naturalized within the rhythms and movements of their bodies that they can no longer verbalize the mental or physical processes involved. (That is why Urton chose a young girl as his teacher, who was still learning the craft, rather than a fully competent adult woman .) Nonliterate numerate practices and ideas, especially in the developing world, are often labeled by academic observers as “ethno mathematics.” But this raises difficult questions about the appropriate use of the “ethno” prefix and about the border between numeracy and mathematics.
How do we distinguish numeracy from mathematics, and where does ethno mathematics fit in?

$990$

When Ubiratan D’Ambrosio coined the term “ethno mathematics” in the mid $1970s$ it was to describe the study of mathematics “in direct relation to [its] social, economic, and cultural backgrounds,” a subject lying “on the borderline between the history of mathematics and cultural anthropology.” However, for many, particularly within mathematics education, it has come to mean the study of culturally “other” mathematics, as if only the academically marginalized have ethnicity (just as, according to some lazy academic views, only women have gender).
This semantic shrinkage is doubly damaging, for it implies that “ethnic” cultures are not fully numerate, while rendering the mainstream of academic mathematics, both past and present, invisible to sociological, anthropological, or ethnographic research. Nor does it distinguish between the intellectual creativity that is mathematics and the routine application of numeracy. If “ethno mathematics” is an unhelpful term, there are useful alternatives.
An influential Brazilian study of childhood numeracy, by Terezinha Nunes and colleagues, distinguishes formally learned “school mathematics” from “street mathematics” created informally by the same children. Jean Lave’s ethnography of adult numeracy in $1980s$ California likewise contrasts “school arithmetic” with “supermarket arithmetic.” The participants in her study often described themselves as arithmetically incompetent and “were unaware of the efficacy of their math practice in the supermarket, and some did not know, even that they used arithmetic practices there.” Yet often the
supermarket setting required the solution of mathematical problems of much greater complexity than superficially similar scholastic “word problems”: The shopper was standing in front of a produce display. As she spoke she put apples, one at a time, into a bag. She put the bag in the cart as she finished talking: “There’s only about three or four [apples] at home, and I have four kids, so you figure at least two apiece in the next three days. These are the kinds of things I have to resupply. I only have a certain amount of storage space in the refrigerator, so I can’t load it up totally. . . .
Now that I’m home in the summertime, this is a good snack food. And I like an apple some times at lunchtime when I come home.” While explicitly considering such variables as the number of apple-consumers in the household, their rate of consumption, fridge storage space, and perhaps implicitly the apples’ price and probably shelf life, the shopper selected nine apples to buy. She might

also have compared the prices of different varieties of apple and  /  or considered whether loose or prepackaged apples were the better buy--all typical supermarket activities that Lave and her researchers observed and correlated with the same subjects’ performance in written tests of arithmetically similar skills. They found “not a single significant correlation between frequency of calculation in a supermarket, and scores on math test, multiple choice test or number facts. . . .
Success and frequency of calculation in supermarket and simulation experiment bear no statistical relationship with schooling, years since schooling was completed, or age.” Rather depressingly for educators, perhaps, Lave’s work suggests that training in school mathematics has little or no impact on numerical competence in adult life.
(Interestingly , this finding conflicts with Cohen’s historical argument discussed above, relating improvements in mathematics education to rising standards of numeracy in early nineteenth-century North America .) Rather, as she and Étienne Wenger argue, learning takes place most effectively when it is situated in the social and professional context to which it pertains, through interaction and collaboration with competent practitioners, rather than through abstract, decontextualized classroom learning.
Learners become part of a “community of practice” that inculcates not only the necessary technical skills but also the beliefs, standards, and behaviors of the group. Through gains in competence, confidence, and social acceptance, the learner moves from the periphery toward the center of the practice community, in due course becoming accepted as a fully fledged expert. It is perhaps in this light, then, that we should understand the process of becoming professionally numerate.
But if situated learning is so effective, the development of supra-utilitarian educational mathematics in the societies of the ancient Middle East and Mediterranean is a major historical conundrum that has hitherto gone unrecognized. $7$ Conclusions This essay began by suggesting that “numeracy is to mathematics what literacy is to literature.” But the case studies presented here show that numeracy has a far greater cognitive reach than that.
