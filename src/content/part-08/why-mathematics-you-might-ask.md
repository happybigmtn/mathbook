A Metaphysical Burden

andré weil [VI.93](/part-06/andr-weil-19061998), speaking at the 1978 International Congress of Mathematicians at Helsinki, concluded his address entitled “History of Mathematics: Why and How?” with these words: Thus my original question “Why mathematical history?” finally reduces itself to the question “Why mathematics?,” which fortunately I do not feel called upon to answer. Proceedings of the ICM, Helsinki, $1978 ( pp$ .
$227 - 36$ , quotation on $p.236)$ I heard Weil’s address, and the applause that followed, and remember imagining circumstances in which that final question could not be so easily evaded. For instance, in 1991 the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology called upon the American Mathematical Society (AMS) to answer a very similar question: “What are the main goals in the mathematical sciences?” Weil knew his audience, and the committee of twelve mathematicians responding to the government body responsible for research budgets knew theirs: VIII.
Final Perspectives The most important long-term goals for the mathematical sciences are: provision of fundamental tools for science and technology, improvement of mathematics education, discovery of new mathematics, facilitation of technology transfer, and support of efficient computation.
$1$ “Meaning is what makes things sell,” wrote Roland Barthes ( 1967 ), and the AMS adopted the posture of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830), who, according to a celebrated comment of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851), included in a letter to legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833) of July $2$ , 1830 , ... had the opinion that the principal aim of mathematics was public utility and explanation of natural phenomena; but a philosopher like him should have known that the sole end of science is the honor of the human mind.
It might seem that the AMS has left a place for “honor” in its third goal, but a later elaboration of that goal directs the reader toward “unexpected” applications of pure mathematics. Few pure mathematicians are as indifferent to practical applications as hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947), who in A Mathematician’s Apology famously claimed that:
“Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil.” But it is fair to assume that, when they are addressing one another rather than government committees, most pure mathematicians (including those who represented the AMS in 1991 ) would choose a quite different list of “most important long-term goals.” In this they have long been able to count on the protection of philosophy. It has been a commonplace since Plato to grant mathematics intrinsic value on metaphysical grounds.
2 The topos of mathematics as a source of certain knowledge was already well established by the second century, when Ptolemy wrote Only mathematics, if one attacks it critically, provides for those who practice it sure and unswerving knowledge, since the demonstration comes about $1$ . From “Pilot assessment of the mathematical sciences (prepared for the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology), ” Notices of the American Mathematical Society 39(1992) : $101 - 10$ . $2$ . The present essay is mainly concerned with metaphysical certainty.
Descartes wrote in Principles of Philosophy (chapter CCVI) of “certainty ... founded on the metaphysical ground that, as God is supremely good and the source of all truth, the faculty of distinguishing truth from error which he gave us, cannot be fallacious so long as we use it aright, and distinctly perceive anything by it,” and cites “the demonstrations of mathematics” as his first example.
Plato (in Republic, VII, $522 - 31$ ) saw mathematics rather as a source of “knowledge of that which exists for ever.” Certainty and its cognates are some, but only some, of the apparent blessings of mathematics that so impressed certain philosophers as to “infect” the whole of their work, as Ian Hacking ( 2000 ) argues.

through incontrovertible means, by arithmetic and geometry. $3$ the crisis in the foundations of mathematics [II.7](/part-02/foundations-crisis) of the early twentieth century, which culminated in gödel’s incompleteness theorems [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem), was largely motivated by a desire to make mathematical certainty safe from dependence on human frailty. As russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970) wrote in Reflections on my Eightieth Birthday: I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith.
I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere. . . . Mathematics is, I believe, the chief source of the belief in eternal and exact truth. Quoted in Hersh (1997) Russell’s hope to ground certainty in logic is largely a thing of the past--as Marvin Minsky wrote in another context, “with out an intimate connection between our knowledge and our intentions, logic leads to madness, not intelligence” (Minsky 1985/1986)4 --but his words continue to echo.
After Jean-Pierre Serre was named first recipient of the Abel Prize, he was quoted in Libération (May $23$ , 2003 ) to the effect that mathematics is the only producer of “totally reliable and verifiable” truths. And Landon T. Clay III, announcing the creation of the 7000000 Millennium Prize Fund, linked his decision to devote much of his personal fortune to the support of pure mathematics to “the decline in religious certitude ...
the pursuit of proof continues to be a strong motivating force in human actions.” $5$ The mind saves its honor, as Jacobi would have it, but only through indenture to a higher power. I would like to express my opinion that the bargain implicit in comments like those just quoted, placing pure mathematicians on the front lines in defense of metaphysical certainty or some other normative concern of philosophers, is an unnecessary burden that fails to do justice to what is uniquely valuable about mathematics.
It also fails to protect pure mathematics from the real existential dangers it faces, of which budget cuts are only the $3$ . See Lloyd (2002), in which is cited Ptolemy’s Syntaxis,  I, chapter $1$ , $16$ . $17 - 21$ . $4$ . Compare René Thom’s comment in connection with his criticism of attempts to reduce mathematics to set theory: “In attempting to attach meaning to all the phrases constructed in ordinary languages, according to Boolean rules, the logician proceeds to a phantasmic, delirious reconstruction of the universe” (reprinted in Tymoczko 1998). $5$ .

Mathematics is not likely to collapse for lack of a coherent account of its certainty, but it may well collapse for lack of an account of its value. $2$ Postmodernism versus Mathematics? One danger that should not worry mathematicians is that of postmodernism. Many thousands of pages have been written on this topic, although it is not clear that the word designates anything specific.
I will nevertheless add a few pages of my own, because the term has come to be used as shorthand for a radical relativism that is thought to call into question not only certainty but rationality in all its forms. $6$ One thus finds mathematicians who are skeptical of certainty in Russell’s sense but who nonetheless express hostility to something they call “postmodernism” as they try to defend reason and the value of mathematics as a rational activity. Applied to architecture, postmodernism designates a reasonably precise tendency.
As a trend defining the spirit of the times, it has been called “the cultural logic of late capitalism,” differing from modernism by emphasizing space rather than time, multiple perspectives and fragmentation rather than unity of meaning and totality, pastiche (sampling) $7$ rather than progress, and much more along the same lines. As a movement in philosophy it is most typically (if abusively) associated with Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes, Jean-François Lyotard, and more generally the “French theory” of the $1960s$ and $1970s$ .
Postmodern prose is eclectic, ironic, self-referential, and hostile to linear narrative. The variant known as posthumanism celebrates the fading of conceptual and material boundaries between human beings and machines. We are all postmodernists insofar as we have experienced the degradation of public discourse under the influence of advertising slogans, and are therefore likely, in spite of ourselves, to read Jacobi’s invocation of “the honor of the human mind” as a precursor of that genre. Mathematicians can even claim to be the first postmodernists:
compare an art critic’s definition of postmodernism--“meaning is suspended in $6$ . For example, Lakoff and Núñez ( 2000 ) write of a “radical form of postmodernism which claims that mathematics is purely historically and culturally contingent and fundamentally subjective.” No examples are given of texts espousing this point of view. $7$ . “Because his ... artistry comes from combining other people’s art, ... the DJ is the epitome of a postmodern artist” (www . jahsonic . com $/$ postmodernism . html) .

favor of a game involving free-floating signs”—with
the definition of mathematics, attributed to hilbert
[VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), as “a game played according to certain simple
rules with meaning less marks on paper.” 8 Mathemat-
ics could nevertheless (or for that very reason) safely
ignore postmodernism, were it not that the latter is sup-
posed to have no room for certainty, metaphysical or
otherwise.9 So it is not surprising that authors who are
considered postmodernists have had some perplexing
run-ins with science and mathematics.
  The typically controversial postmodernist account of
science sounds like this:
  Science and philosophy must jettison their grandiose
  metaphysical claims and view themselves more mod-
  estly as just another set of narratives.

  As far as mathematics is concerned, relativism of this
kind has more to do with English-language post mod-
ernism than with the French original. One might have
thought that mathematical progress from axioms to
theorems and from lesser to greater abstraction or gen-
erality constituted a prime example of the sort of “mas-
ter narrative” that French postmodernists regarded
with suspicion, and a particularly tempting target
given the special role Enlightenment thinking reserved
for mathematical explanation; but that seems not to
have been the case. Although the most prominent
French philosophers associated with postmodernism
were metaphysical skeptics in other regards, they had
no quarrel with mathematics’ metaphysical preten-
sions per se; but they did question their relevance to
the human sciences. For Derrida, thinking of leibniz
[VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) in particular, “[mathematics] was always the
exemplary model of scientificity” (in Of Grammatology,
p. 27), and Foucault claimed that:
  Mathematics has certainly served as a model for most
  scientific discourse[s] in their efforts to attain formal
  rigor and demonstrativity; but for the historian who

The Archeology of Knowledge (pp. 188–89)
At least one of postmodernism’s canonical French
texts does take on the issue of certainty in science and
mathematics directly. Alluding to the trilogy of Gödel’s
theorems, uncertainty in quantum mechanics, and frac-
tals,11 Lyotard saw in contemporary mathematics
a current that calls into question precise measure-
ment and prediction of the behavior of objects at the
human scale ... postmodern science ... produces not
the known, but the unknown.

Various authors have reminded readers that Gödel’s
theorems and the uncertainty principle (and chaos) are

statements about formal systems in mathematics and
particle physics (and nonlinear differential equations),
respectively, and as such have no bearing on meta-
physics.12 The arguments are often eloquent but alto-
gether beside the point, and of little comfort to seekers
of certainty like Russell. Metaphysical certainty, what-
ever it may be, cannot be any less binding than a math-
ematical proof. Gödel’s theorem, that it is impossible
to prove, within a formal system, that that formal sys-
tem is consistent, can reasonably be taken to mean that
metaphysical certainty cannot be guaranteed by math-
ematical means alone.13 But Serre, in his comments to
Libération, surely meant something more than the tau-
tology that mathematical truth is totally reliable and
verifiable by the standards of mathematics. The struggle

about deconstruction: see Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, dies at
74, New York Times, October 10, 2004. Appeals to the presumed value
of even the most abstruse mathematics, in order to legitimate obscu-
rity elsewhere, are common. I first encountered such an argument
in an article by composer (and former mathematician) Milton Bab-
bitt entitled “Who cares if you listen?” (High Fidelity, February 1958):
“Why should the layman be other than bored and puzzled by what
he is unable to understand, music or anything else?” With this sort
of talk, the justification of pure mathematics on aesthetic grounds is
turned upside down. That is why I address aesthetic answers to the
question of my title—which are by far the most popular among my

to pin down this “something more,” to find what one
might call the “essence” of mathematics, is why the phi-
losophy of mathematics keeps visiting the scenes of its
many past defeats.
   Even if Lyotard does not make the case very well, one
can detect a “postmodern” sensibility in much of recent
science, from Stephen Jay Gould’s insistence that evo-
lution is highly contingent, to complexity theory, to the
study of consciousness as an “emergent” phenomenon.
What these developments have in common is a rejec-
tion of reductionism and related top-down “master
narratives,” not because they are wrong but because
they are irrelevant and use less. It would be going too
far to describe this kind of science as a new Kuhnian
paradigm (the notion is, in any case, widely criticized
as over simplified), but it is noticeably different from
the disciplines that inspired the analytic philosophy of
science. As for mathematics, there have been sugges-
tions that it too has postmodern aspects—for exam-
ple, Jürgen Jost has written a book entitled Postmodern
Analysis and some specialists now claim to be working
in “postmodern algebra”—but I do not see any genuine
signs of this sensibility. Indeed, I am not even sure that
it makes sense to draw the line between modern and
postmodern. Hilbert’s definition of mathematics as a
game does sound like something from Derrida, but if
Hilbert’s foundational program (“wir müssen wissen,
wir werden wissen”) is not a prime example of high
modernism, then what is? On the other hand, the aban-
don ment of all forms of foundationalism in an anthol-
ogy of Tymoczko (1998) is a rejection of “master nar-
ratives” within philosophy of mathematics, and indeed
the blurb calls the anthology “postmodern.” 14
     3    Sociology Aims for the High Ground
While Weil is supposed to have discounted Gödel’s
metaphysical menace by making it into a joke—“God
exists since mathematics is consistent, and the Devil
exists since we cannot prove it”—his fellow Bourbakist
Dieudonné attempted a counterattack:
  Just as physicists and biologists believe in the per-
  manence of the laws of nature, solely because they
  have observed this up to now, ... the mathematicians
  called—wrongly—“formalists” (... at present the near
  totality of mathematical researchers) are convinced

that no contradiction will appear in set theory, none
having manifested themselves for 80 years.15
This is either an inductive (empirical), sociological,
or pragmatist argument. All these trends are indeed
present in postmodernism, more typically in English
sociology of science than in French philosophy:
The compelling force of mathematical procedures does
not derive from their being transcendent, but from
their being accepted and used by a group of people.
The procedures are not used because they are correct,
or correspond to an ideal; they are deemed correct
because they are accepted.
David Bloor, in Wittgenstein: A Social Theory of
Knowledge (Macmillan, London, 1983)
The Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) move-
ment, of which David Bloor was a founder, is firmly
rooted in postwar philosophy of science in the analytic
tradition. The later Wittgenstein’s discussion of math-
ematics, and knowledge more generally, in terms of
“language-games,” “forms of life,” and learning to fol-
low rules emphasizes social factors, and SSK is enthu-
siastically Wittgensteinian. Of course, Wittgenstein’s
work is notoriously unsystematic and lends itself to
a variety of interpretations. I find it wrong to see the
Wittgenstein who wrote “Grounds for doubt are lack-
ing!” as a skeptic. Beyond the social factors to which
Wittgenstein drew explicit attention, he clearly per-
ceived “something more” specifically in mathematics
(“the hardness of the logical must”), to which our
language and philosophy are not able to do justice.16
Can sociology succeed where philosophy has failed?
Bloor’s militant “naturalist” response to the question of
“whether sociology can touch the very heart of math-
ematical knowledge” (Bloor 1976) is less an exercise
in debunking metaphysics than an attempt to seize
the metaphysical high ground for sociology. An other-
wise subtle ethnographic study by Claude Rosental of
the resolution of a conflict among logicians betrays a
similar sensibility, as does his suggestion that train-
ing in mathematics and logic might have constituted a
“serious handicap” to carrying out his project (Rosental

9702003 ). The classic declaration of the latter kind is due to Bruno Latour and Stephen Woolgar: [W] e do not regard prior cognition ... as a necessary prerequisite for understanding scientists’ work. This is similar to an anthropologist’s refusal to bow before the knowledge of a primitive sorcerer. There are, as far as we know, no a priori reasons for supposing that scientists’ practice is more rational than that of outsiders.
Latour and Woolgar, Laboratory Life, $pp.29 - 30$ (Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1986 ) But one can also imagine sociologists paying serious attention to mathematicians’ accounts of their experience, addressing in the process the question that Weil did not.
For example, Bettina Heintz, in fieldwork at the Max-Planck-Institut in Bonn, which was billed as the first study of mathematics from the perspective of constructivist sociology of science, worries about “going native” and “over identifying with the dominant culture.” But her subject is the eminently sociological one of determining how mathematicians reach consensus, and her methodology, far from treating practicing mathematicians as “primitive sorcerers,” records their epistemic perspectives sympathetically and at length.
One has the impression that, in spite of the limitations of her methodology, Heintz is more interested in accounting for “real mathematics,” to which we shall return below, where as Bloor and Rosental are preoccupied with marshaling evidence to counter the metaphysical preoccupations of philosophers. Under siege from Gödel’s theorem, Popper’s attack on verificationism, Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions, Lakatos’s dialectical approach to the contents of knowledge in Proofs and Refutations, as well as Wittgenstein, certainty in Russell’s sense has largely been scrapped.
17 As for the social, philosophical, and spiritual needs that the notion of metaphysical certainty was designed to address, they remain. Thus, on the one hand, those with tendencies that I have $17$ . Lakatos’s posthumous “A renaissance of empiricism in the recent philosophy of mathematics,” presents a long series of quotations by mathematicians and a few philosophers, including Russell in 1924 , acknowledging that mathematics is uncertain, after all. Naturally, most of those cited refer directly or indirectly to Gödel’s theorem. The article was reprinted in Tymoczko ( 1998 ).
“Only dogma or theory has made people say that mathematics as a whole has a peculiar certainty,” writes Hacking ( 2000 ). Certainty persists, however, in the titles of philosophy books, e.g., Marcus Giaquinto’s optimistic The Search for Certainty: A Philosophical Account of Foundations of Mathematics (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004 ).

VIII. Final Perspectives

described as postmodernist continue to express skepticism regarding certainty, seemingly unaware that their target is now little more than an advertising slogan that has little to do with the real concerns of mathematicians; while, on the other hand, analytic philosophy has sought to substitute more flexible notions. The term “warrant,” for example, is used in an attempt by Philip Kitcher to develop a consistent account of mathematics on empirical rather than aprioristic grounds.
Kitcher recalls frege’s [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925) frustration with the mathematicians of his time, observing that, “When Frege emphasizes the possibility of complete clarity and certainty in mathematical knowledge, he is advancing a picture of mathematics that is almost irrelevant to the working mathematician” (Kitcher 1984 ). However, Kitcher and the SSK remain obsessed by the problem of “how our mathematical knowledge [is] acquired” (Kitcher 1984 ), where knowledge is taken to be true and justified belief.
Reading Heintz ( 2000 ), one learns that now, as in Frege’s day, mathematicians themselves widely consider these problems to be outdated or beside the point. The most controversial aspect of the SSK’s “strong programme,” formulated by Bloor and Barry Barnes, is the “thesis of symmetry”: the insistence that truth or falsity not be taken into account when investigating how a scientific claim comes to be accepted as knowledge.
Heintz’s fieldwork suggests that this is compatible with the view prevailing among mathematicians regarding acceptance of a mathematical proof, a “kind of consensus theory of truth” (Heintz 2000). 18 A striking instance of “how a mathematical proof comes to be accepted as knowledge” is playing out even as I am writing these lines. Grigori Perelman’s announced proof of the poincaré conjecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture) is under going unprecedented scrutiny in a small number of specialized centers, with the hope of determining the truth or falsity of Perelman’s claim.
This is going on completely beyond the spotlight of sociology, as far as I know, and with no guidance from philosophy, even though the 1000000 prize offered by the Clay $18$ . Heintz quotes Yu. I. Manin--“A proof only becomes a proof after the social act of ‘accepting it as a proof’ ”--as well as René Thom’s “community” theory of truth. One can of course always ask whether Heintz selectively quoted mathematicians whose positions support her thesis. This question can be asked of any sociological study, and it is best to let the sociologists work out their methodological issues.
An important remark, however: though Heintz’s original goal was to account for the formation of consensus among mathematicians within a science studies framework--with questionable success, but that is another matter--she does not defend a particular school within philosophy of mathematics. In this she differs from Bloor, for instance, who identifies himself explicitly as an empiricist.

VIII.2.   “Why Mathematics?” You Might Ask

Mathematical Institute is in no sense Platonic,19 and
the rules for awarding the prize presuppose the fallibil-
ity of the mathematical community, in terms very sim-
ilar to those that Heintz’s informants expressed spon-
taneously (see the third and subsequent paragraphs at
www.claymath.org/millennium/rules_etc). The case is
exceptional, however; “certifying knowledge,” in Rosen-
tal’s sense, is as such relatively unimportant to mathe-
maticians, and Perelman’s close readers would prob-
ably describe what they are doing as attempting to
understand his proof rather than “certifying” it as
knowledge (for the sake of the community, or a gen-
erous benefactor, or philosophers or sociologists).20

“By far the larger part of activity in what goes by
the name philosophy of mathematics is dead to what
mathematicians think and have thought, aside from
an unbalanced interest in the ‘foundational’ ideas of
the 1880–1930 period, yielding too often a distorted
picture of that time,” announced David Corfield, pre-
sent ing his efforts to develop a “philosophy of real
mathematics.” 21 Corfield contrasted the traditional
apriorist’s concerns, “How should we talk about math-
ematical truth? Do mathematical terms or statements
refer? If so, what are the referents and how do we
have access to them?” (Corfield 2003), with the list
of questions Aspray and Kitcher consider typical of
the “maverick tradition” in philosophy of mathemat-
ics: “How does mathematical knowledge grow? What
is mathematical progress? What makes some mathe-
mat ical ideas (or theories) better than others? What is
mathematical explanation?” (quoted by Corfield 2003).
   The mavericks, well represented in Tymoczko’s an-
thology, have moved a welcome step away from cer-

  20. “Having shown how the production of certified knowledge in
logic could constitute an object of a sociological investigation and
analysis, a vast field of research takes shape” (Rosental 2003). I sus-    astonished to discover that the concerns of twentieth-century French
pect that identifying and accounting for the priorities expressed by
mathematicians themselves would constitute a much richer field of
research.

tainty. Nevertheless, the philosophers and philosophi-
cally minded sociologists I have mentioned—with the
partial exception of Corfield, to be explored below—
still often write as though mathematicians were creat-
ing Truth or Knowledge,22 almost as a favor to philos-
ophy or sociology, to show how such a feat is possible.
Or just to show that it is possible.23 We mathemat i-
cians, on the other hand, are quite convinced that
we are creating mathematics, and it is the “why” of
that activity, with out the ennobling assimilation to the
generic objects of interest to epistemology, that, as Weil
understood, required no explanation in Helsinki.
“Who ever under takes to set himself up as a judge
in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by

cians tend to respond with dismay rather than laugh-
ter, and then only to blunders so egregious as to be
universally recognized as such.24 Although those who
find fault with philosophical speculation regarding the
nature of mathematics seem to be under an implicit
obligation to propose a speculative alternative, experi-
ence suggests that the practice of mathematics renders
one unfit to do so. This, more than the fear of ridicule,
is the main reason I would not venture my own spec-
ula tive philosophy of mathematics. If it is hard “for
those who are used to thought processes stemming
from geometry and algebra” to “develop the sort of
intuition common among physicists” (R. Mac Pherson,
quoted in Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for
Mathematicians by Deligne (volume 1, p. 2)), bridging
the gap between mathematicians and metaphysicians is
probably hope less. There are superficial parallels, to be
sure: a metaphysical abstraction such as “essence,” like
a mathematical abstraction such as “set,” designates
nothing in itself, but rather refers to a canonical body
22. See, however, Hacking: “The truth of a sentence (of a kind intro-
that style” (Hacking 2002).

philosophers of mathematics are entirely different. Following Husserl,
the French concentrate largely on the phe no meno logical experience
of the individual mathematical subject. It is only a slight exaggera-

in philosophy of mathematics have become mutually incomprehensi-

of specialized texts in which the term plays a central role. I would like to argue that the nothing designated by “set” is some how different, and more fruitful, than the nothing designated by “essence.” But the means at my disposal for making such an argument take the form of mathematical reasoning, which leads me, at best, to a vicious circle. 25 More bluntly, and for reasons akin to those Serre invoked in his Libération interview, I cannot be satisfied with an answer that is less certain than the sort of answer mathematics provides;
for a mathematician, a pragmatist answer to Weil’s question is an admission of defeat. And yet I am aware that (metaphysically certain) grounds for distinguishing mathematical certainty from pragmatic certainty are lacking! Another, possibly more profound, reason to steer clear of speculation is that, where as philosophy presents itself as a dialogue extending over millennia, so that to understand each new contribution one would ideally be familiar with all previous contributions, mathematics is in principle supposed to be derivable by pure reason from a small number of axioms.
A philosophical proposition, in other words, remains attached to its origins and context; a mathematical proposition floats free. This principle, an important constituent of the aura of metaphysical certainty surrounding mathematics, does not in fact bear much resemblance to mathematics as it is actually practiced--“one of humankind’s longest conversations,” as Barry Mazur puts it.
I am nonetheless painfully aware that my personal “conversation” with the philosophical tradition is thoroughly unreliable, and my choice of footnotes is primarily the fruit of a random walk (or random surf, or remix) among scraps of the literature I have happened to encounter. If I am nevertheless writing about philosophy, it is in large part because of a question that was put to me in 1995 , during a presentation of Wiles’s proof of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) to an audience of scientists.
An October 1993 article in Scientific American entitled “The death of proof” had called Wiles’s proof a “splendid anachronism,” citing Laszlo Babai and his collaborators, among others, in support of the thesis that, in the future, deductive proof in mathematics will be largely supplanted by computer-assisted proofs and probabilistic arguments. That same month $25$ . “Truth is always the possibility of its proper destruction,” according to the (nonpostmodern) French philosopher, Alain Badiou, taking Gödel’s theorem as an example (www . egs .

VIII. Final Perspectives

the Notices of the American Mathematical Society ( $40$ : $978 - 81)$ published Doron Zeilberger’s manifesto “Theorems for a price,” predicting a rapid transition from rigorous proofs to an “age of semi-rigorous mathematics, in which identities (and perhaps other kinds of theorems) will carry price tags” measured in computer time and proportional to the degree of certainty desired, to be followed in turn by “abandoning the task of keeping track of price altogether, and ... the metamorphosis to non-rigorous mathematics” (John Horgan, Scientific American October 1993 : $92 - 102)$ .
26 Feeling called upon to answer the question Weil avoided, I argued that the basic unit of mathematics is the concept rather than the theorem, that the purpose of a proof is to illuminate a concept rather than merely confirm a theorem, and that the replacement of deductive proofs by probabilistic or mechanical proofs should be compared not to the introduction of a new technology for producing shoes, say, but rather to the attempt to replace shoes by the sales receipts, or perhaps the cash profits, of the shoe factory. The audience had its own question: Was I talking about certainty?
Of course not. That option has been philosophically discredited, as I have tried to explain. And other normative prescriptions fall victim no less easily to the laughter of philosophers. On the other hand, I see no pragmatic reason why probabilistic or mechanical proofs would not suit the five goals on the AMS committee’s list just as well as deductive proofs, nor any sociological reason why they should not be as effective in commanding consensus in the event of a paradigm shift. So what was I talking about?
Such a question, at this point in the essay, practically begs to be answered by an advertising slogan. For example: The practice of making what one writes “reliable and verifiable” fosters critical thinking in general. This is a popular argument for teaching proofs, and is probably even true, but how would one go about verifying such a claim? I am very much tempted to say that the concepts that serve as material for “one $26$ .
In the pop posthumanist scenarios promoted by Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil, and the like, computers acquire all human capabilities, including the ability to generate and prove theorems--for some reason this is always considered a landmark--by the middle of the twentyfirst century. The distinction between humans and computers subsequently fades away rather rapidly, making Zeilberger’s prediction moot. A more recent, and much more nuanced, discussion of prospects for automatic theorem proving has been posted on the Internet by Maggesi and Simpson (undated) .

of humankind’s longest conversations,” deserve to be
appreciated on their own terms. Note that nothing is
more “emergent” than a conversation. But that would
be unfaithful to the spirit of Mazur’s book, one of
whose strengths is its refusal to con form to a linear
narrative. In any case, on its own the argument does
not seem to be sufficient: a similar argument could be
made in favor of religious faith.

Rather than hazard an answer to Weil’s (non)question
here, I will take a cue from Corfield and suggest that
one can best account for the value of pure mathemat-
ics by attending to what mathematicians write and say.
A handful of commonplace words appear consistently,
invested with unexpected power, when mathematicians
attempt to account, formally as well as informally, for
their value judgments, and these collectively constitute
an answer to the question Weil left hanging.
  weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) wrote a book with the provocative title
The Idea of a Riemann Surface27 and referred in his
preface to Plato. The word “concept” that was central in
my reply to the audience is closer to this use of the term
“Idea” as used by any number of philosophers, includ-
ing most of those mentioned in this essay. A square, or
a riemannian manifold [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), would be a con-
cept or “Idea” in this sense, and this is how the word
“concept” tends to be used by mathematicians, who
generally reserve the word “idea” to designate some-
thing else. In Plato’s Meno, the proof of the doubling
of the square—draw diagonals and fit the resulting tri-
angles together—which the slave “remembers” under
Socrates’ coaching, is taken by Plato to be contained in
the “Idea” of the square. For a mathematician, drawing
the diagonals and moving the triangles are the ideas.
  That a contrast can be drawn, as I did in 1995,
between “illuminating concepts” and “confirming the-
orems” is something of a truism among mathemat i-
cians and even some philosophers. Even by 1950 Pop-
per had argued that “a calculator ... will not distinguish
ingenious proofs and interesting theorems from dull
and uninteresting ones” (quoted in Heintz 2000). Cor-
field correctly states that “what mathematicians are
largely looking for from each other’s proofs are new
concepts, techniques, and interpretations”; they are not
  27. Weyl used the word Idee in his title but applied the term Begriff     29. I heard this joke reported by several people who claimed to have

“concept.”

merely “establishing the truth or correctness of propo-
sit i ons” (p. 56). However, although he devotes a chap-
ter to the “extremely complex subject” of “mathemat i-
cal conceptualizati on,” he does not dwell on concepts
(or “Ideas”) as such; and neither will I. It is almost
impossible to talk in general terms about mathematical
concepts with out getting caught up in the debate over
their reality (and provoking the laughter of the philoso-
phers). Those who write about mathematics (mathe-

tendency to claim that most mathematicians are Platon-
ists, whether or not they have committed themselves
explicitly to a philosophical position. Maybe it can be
argued that Platonism is implicit in the syntax of math-
ematical statements; maybe this is what Weil meant
by his claim, quoted by Bourguignon (2001), that most
mathematicians “spend a good portion of their profes-
sional time be having as if they were [Platonists].” 28 In
practice I would guess that most mathematicians are
pragmatists, in the spirit of the remarks of Dieudonné
quoted above.
On the other hand, there is no doubt whatsoever
that the “ideas” that matter to mathematicians are real.
A mathematician, according to a joke attributed to
Weil,29 can be defined as some one who has had two
ideas (mathematical, of course). But then, Weil wor-
ried, so-and-so would be a mathematician. In a cele-
brated account by poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) of the role of the
unconscious in a mathematical discovery, the climactic
moment was the arrival of an idea (“the idea came to
me”) as he placed his foot on the steps of the omnibus
(“L’idée me vint,” Poincaré (1999)).
More to the point, consider Hacking’s justification of
his own commitment to a realist ontology of electrons:
“So far as I’m concerned, if you can spray them then
they are real” (Hacking 1983). By the same token, if you
can steal ideas, then they are real. Every mathematician
knows that ideas can be and often are stolen. Polemics
then ensue, considerably juicier than the epistemic
controversy studied by Rosental.
Nothing in the life of mathematics has more of the
attributes of materiality than (lowercase) ideas. They
have “features” (Gowers 2002), they can be “tried out”
28. Plato saw things quite the other way around: “Their language
[speaking of mathematicians] is most ludicrous, though they cannot
help it, for they speak as if they were doing something and as if all their
words were directed toward action” (Republic VII.527 a, my emphasis).

heard it from Shimura.

(Singer30 ), they can be “passed from hand to hand”
(Corfield 2003), they some times “originate in the real
world” (Atiyah in the preface to Arnold et al. (2000)) or
are promoted from the status of calculations by becom-
ing “an integral part of the theory” (Godement 2001). At
some point they come into being: it is generally under-
stood, for example, that “new ideas” will be needed
to solve the Clay Millennium Problems. They can also
be counted. I once heard Serre introduce the proof of
a famous conjecture by saying that it contained two
or three real ideas, where “real” was intended as high
praise. The ambiguity did not concern the number of
ideas—there were three, which Serre enumerated—but
whether all three were original to the author. Ideas are
public: necessarily so, in order to be stolen, or to be pre-
sent able as Serre did in his lecture. Poincaré’s idea was
a sentence (“the transformations of which I had made
use to define Fuchsian functions were identical to those
of non-Euclidean geometry”); the slave’s idea in Meno
was a line in the sand.
   Early in his unpublished memoirs Récoltes et Sem-
ailles, Grothendieck wrote that “ideas, even dreams”
were, in Allyn Jackson’s terminology, the “essence and
power” of his mathematical work (Jackson 2004). An
idea is typically symptomatic of “insight,” and the ca-
pacity for insight is generally called “intuition.” Math-
ematicians have borrowed all of these terms from phi-
losophy but use them to completely different ends.
Philosophers tend to follow Kant in attributing intu-
itions—the ones that with out concepts are blind—to
transcendental subjects or their more down-to-earth
offspring. Intuition in this sense is a poor substitute
for certainty, as even the mavericks recognize. “Intu-
ition ... is frequently a prelude to mathematical know-
ledge,” wrote Kitcher. “By itself it does not warrant
belief.” Poincaré called intuition “the tool of invention,”
a “je ne sais quoi” that holds a proof together, but he
contrasted it with logic, “the tool of demonstration,”
which “alone can provide certainty.” Saunders Mac Lane
expressed himself in much the same terms nearly a cen-
tury later. David Ruelle considered reliance on (visual)
intuition a characteristic feature of human (as opposed
to extra ter res trial) mathematics.31

VIII. Final Perspectives
In each case intuition belongs to the private sphere,
and is relegated to the “context of discovery,” as
opposed to the “context of justification” deemed wor-
thy of philosophy’s full attention. When mathemat i-
cians refer to “intuition” in the sense I have in mind, it
is crucially public.32 As in the quotation from Mac Pher-
son a few paragraphs back, it can be transmitted from
teacher to student, or through a successful lecture, or
developed collectively by running a seminar and writ-
ing a book on the proceedings. It has something in com-
mon with a “style of reasoning,” but on a smaller scale.
Grothendieck resorted to perceptual metaphor when
describing Serre’s ability to communicate something
akin to intuition:
The essential thing was that Serre each time strongly
sensed the rich meaning behind a statement that, on
the page, would doubt less have left me neither hot nor
cold—and that he could “transmit” this perception of a
rich, tangible, and mysterious substance—this percep-
tion that is at the same time the desire to understand
this substance, to penetrate it.
Récoltes et Semailles, p. 556
“Even those who try to articulate, to classify, the
fruits of the imagination, and who are committed to the
existence of an inner experience concomitant with it,
admit to dark difficulty in describing it,” wrote Mazur,
elaborating an unusual array of literary and rhetorical
strategies to chip away at the difficulty (Mazur 2003).
This much is certain: this inner experience of imagi-
nation, or of understanding, is what drives people to
become mathematicians, and it is why Weil could count
on his audience’s silent assent. Heintz recorded some
of her informants’ attempts to describe this inner expe-
rience: “[In mathematics] you have concrete objects
before you and you interact with them, talk with them.
And some times they answer you.” She even talks about
the “idea” that helps put the pieces together. “And sud-
denly you see the picture,” she was told. Yet all this
raw ethnographic data is presented in a chapter whose
title, “Beauty and experiment: discovery of truth in
mathematics,” betrays her relentlessly epistemological
preoccupations (Heintz 2000).
“The specific ways that mathematical truths move
from person to person, and how they are transformed
in the process, are as difficult to capture as the truths
themselves,” wrote Mazur (2003), in what could have
32. This is also true of the normative program of intuitionism asso-

been a comment on Grothendieck’s remarks on Serre.
The central notion in Mazur’s book is that of “imagina-
tion.” I have chosen the terms “idea” and “intuition” not     ematicians for blackboards over contemporary audio-
for their intrinsic importance, though I believe each of
the terms points to ways of talking about the famous
“flash in the middle of a long night” that ends Poincaré’s     munication as performance, a word that manages to be
The Value of Science: “But this flash is everything.” What     typically postmodern and premodern at the same time.
strikes me about these terms is how their pervasiveness
in mathematicians’ conversations—the sense that they,
more than the definitive theorems, are “everything”—
contrasts so starkly with their near exclusion from
philosophical consideration, even though the words
themselves can be seen on practically every page of
philosophy of mathematics. Maybe their very banality
makes them appear philosophically trivial. Or maybe
the problem is that the same words serve so many dis-
tinct purposes. Corfield uses the same word to des-
ignate what I am calling “ideas” (“the ideas in Hopf’s
1942 paper”) as well as “Ideas” (“the idea of groups”)
and something halfway between the two (the “idea”
of decomposing representations into their irreducible
components for a variety of purposes, p. 206). Else-
where, the word crops up in connection with what
mathematicians often refer to as “philosophy,” as in
the “Langlands philosophy” (“Kronecker’s ideas” about
divisibility, p. 202), and in many completely unrelated
places as well. Corfield proposes to resolve what he sees
as an anomaly in Lakatos’s “methodology of scientific
research programmes” as applied to mathematics by “a
shift of perspective from seeing a mathematical theory
as a collection of statements making truth claims, to
seeing it as the clarification and elaboration of certain
central ideas” (p. 181). He sees “a kind of creative vague-     ledge of structures gained by employing reason beyond
ness to the central idea” in each of the four examples he
offers to represent this shift of perspective; but on my
count the ideas he chooses include two “philosophies,”
one “Idea,” and one which is neither of these.
  Other value-laden terms are no less important. In the
wake of bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935), quite a few philosophers
(Cavaillès, Lautman, Piaget, and more recently Tiles)
have made serious attempts to make sense of “struc-
ture” in mathematics. I have read a number of philo-
so phical attempts to account for mathematical aes thet-
ics, though none has left much of an impression. The
practically universal use of dynamical or spatiotempo-
ral metaphors (“the space X is fibered over Y ,” etc.), and
the pronounced tendency to present proofs as series
of actions playing out in time (“now choose an orbit
passing arbitrarily close to the point x”) have attracted     of mathematicians’ use of action metaphors.

little attention from philosophers.33 These phenomena
may be linked to the curious preference of many math-
visual technology, which in turn draws attention to the
neglected (and emergent) aspect of mathematical com-
For his part, Corfield does not talk much about
“intuition” and is ambiguous about what he means by
“ideas,” but his discussions of “natural” and “impor-
tance,” in the context of an analysis of the debate on
the relative merits of groups and groupoids, are philo-
sophically insightful while remaining faithful to the
use of the terms by “real” mathematicians. His treat-
ment of “postmodern algebra,” where “diagrams are
not just there to illustrate, they are used to calculate
and to prove results rigorously” (p. 254), also has street
credibility. It is true that much of his book remains
concerned with “maverick” questions, such as account-
ing for plausible reasoning. But there is no question
that Corfield likes mathematics, and for the right rea-
sons; his book, unlike most treatises in philosophy of
mathematics, is definitely part of the “conversation.”
Morris Kline called the “loss of certainty” entailed
by Gödel’s theorems an “intellectual tragedy” and actu-
ally counseled “prudence” in designing bridges “using
theory involving infinite sets or the axiom of choice”
(Kline 1980). The word “tragedy” seems misplaced but
the pathos is real, as it was for Russell. Pathos and its
twin, resolute optimism, have found an unlikely home
in the philosophy of mathematics:
If this conception of mathematics [as “human know-
the bounds of logic”] can be sustained, mathematics
could once again serve as a source of an image of
reason liberated from formal imprisonment, freed to
confront apocalyptic post-modern visions.
Mary Tiles, Mathematics and the Image of Reason, p. 4
(Routledge, London, 1991)
Whether or not it carries weight with congressional
committees, I find this goal appealing, but it is a goal
for philosophers, not for mathematicians. I’m willing to
apply the “principle of charity” to philosophers if they
will do the same for me. Corfield wrote (p. 39):
33. Nuñez’s article “Do real numbers really move?” (in Hersh 2006)
makes interesting points regarding mathematicians’ use of metaphors
of motion, though he limits his analysis to examples specifically
related to the mathematics of motion. Plato specifically disapproved

Human mathematicians pride themselves on producing beautiful, clear, explanatory proofs, and devote much of their effort to reworking results in conceptually illuminating ways. Philosophers must not evade their duty to treat these value judgments in mathematics. They also have a duty, it seems to me, to account for terms like “idea” and “intuition”--and “conceptual” for that matter. An answer to the question “Why philosophy?” might well begin there.

Postscript

In December 2004 my university joined a number of other institutions in France and elsewhere in hosting a traveling UNESCO-sponsored exhibition entitled “Pourquoi les mathématiques?” Hoping to learn the answer before my submission deadline, I spent a few hours at the exhibition. It was clever and engaging, presenting a variety of (pure) mathematical ideas with a sprinkling of practical applications, but in no way did it address the “Pourquoi?” of the title.
An organizer was on hand, and when I turned to her for guidance she explained that the French title was a solution to a problem of translation. The English title, which came first, was “Experiencing mathematics.” This, she assured me, has no adequate French translation, so “Pourquoi les mathématiques?” was chosen as the best substitute. Maybe the solution to the problem of my title is simply to accept the translation in the opposite direction. Even the most ruthless funding agency is not yet so post-human as to require an answer to “Why experience?” $34$ Acknowledgments.
