A Metaphysical Burden

andré weil [VI.93](/part-06/andr-weil-19061998), speaking at the 1978 International Congress of Mathematicians at Helsinki, concluded his address entitled “History of Mathematics: Why and How?” with these words: Thus my original question “Why mathematical history?” finally reduces itself to the question “Why mathematics?,” which fortunately I do not feel called upon to answer. Proceedings of the ICM, Helsinki, $1978 ( pp$ .
$227 - 36$ , quotation on $p.236)$ I heard Weil’s address, and the applause that followed, and remember imagining circumstances in which that final question could not be so easily evaded. For instance, in 1991 the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology called upon the American Mathematical Society (AMS) to answer a very similar question: “What are the main goals in the mathematical sciences?” Weil knew his audience, and the committee of twelve mathematicians responding to the government body responsible for research budgets knew theirs: VIII.
Final Perspectives The most important long-term goals for the mathematical sciences are: provision of fundamental tools for science and technology, improvement of mathematics education, discovery of new mathematics, facilitation of technology transfer, and support of efficient computation.
$1$ “Meaning is what makes things sell,” wrote Roland Barthes ( 1967 ) , and the AMS adopted the posture of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830), who, according to a celebrated comment of jacobi [VI.35](/part-06/carl-gustav-jacob-jacobi-18041851), included in a letter to legendre [VI.24](/part-06/adrien-marie-legendre-17521833) of July $2$ , 1830 , ... had the opinion that the principal aim of mathematics was public utility and explanation of natural phenomena; but a philosopher like him should have known that the sole end of science is the honor of the human mind.
It might seem that the AMS has left a place for “honor” in its third goal, but a later elaboration of that goal directs the reader toward “unexpected” applications of pure mathematics. Few pure mathematicians are as indifferent to practical applications as hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947), who in A Mathematician’s Apology famously claimed that:
“Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil.” But it is fair to assume that, when they are addressing one another rather than government committees, most pure mathematicians (including those who represented the AMS in 1991 ) would choose a quite different list of “most important long-term goals.” In this they have long been able to count on the protection of philosophy. It has been a commonplace since Plato to grant mathematics intrinsic value on metaphysical grounds.
2 The topos of mathematics as a source of certain knowledge was already well established by the second century, when Ptolemy wrote Only mathematics, if one attacks it critically, provides for those who practice it sure and unswerving knowledge, since the demonstration comes about $1$ . From “Pilot assessment of the mathematical sciences (prepared for the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology), ” Notices of the American Mathematical Society 39(1992) : $101 - 10$ . $2$ . The present essay is mainly concerned with metaphysical certainty.
Descartes wrote in Principles of Philosophy (chapter CCVI) of “certainty ... founded on the metaphysical ground that, as God is supremely good and the source of all truth, the faculty of distinguishing truth from error which he gave us, cannot be fallacious so long as we use it aright, and distinctly perceive anything by it,” and cites “the demonstrations of mathematics” as his first example.
Plato (in Republic, VII, $522 - 31$ ) saw mathematics rather as a source of “knowledge of that which exists for ever.” Certainty and its cognates are some, but only some, of the apparent blessings of mathematics that so impressed certain philosophers as to “infect” the whole of their work, as Ian Hacking ( 2000 ) argues.

through incontrovertible means, by arithmetic and geometry. $3$ the crisis in the foundations of mathematics [II.7](/part-02/foundations-crisis) of the early twentieth century, which culminated in gödel’s incompleteness theorems [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem), was largely motivated by a desire to make mathematical certainty safe from dependence on human frailty. As russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970) wrote in Reflections on my Eightieth Birthday: I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith.
I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere. . . . Mathematics is, I believe, the chief source of the belief in eternal and exact truth. Quoted in Hersh (1997) Russell’s hope to ground certainty in logic is largely a thing of the past--as Marvin Minsky wrote in another context, “with out an intimate connection between our knowledge and our intentions, logic leads to madness, not intelligence” (Minsky 1985/1986)4 --but his words continue to echo.
After Jean-Pierre Serre was named first recipient of the Abel Prize, he was quoted in Libération (May $23$ , 2003 ) to the effect that mathematics is the only producer of “totally reliable and verifiable” truths. And Landon T. Clay III, announcing the creation of the 7000000 Millennium Prize Fund, linked his decision to devote much of his personal fortune to the support of pure mathematics to “the decline in religious certitude ...
the pursuit of proof continues to be a strong motivating force in human actions.” $5$ The mind saves its honor, as Jacobi would have it, but only through indenture to a higher power. I would like to express my opinion that the bargain implicit in comments like those just quoted, placing pure mathematicians on the front lines in defense of metaphysical certainty or some other normative concern of philosophers, is an unnecessary burden that fails to do justice to what is uniquely valuable about mathematics.
It also fails to protect pure mathematics from the real existential dangers it faces, of which budget cuts are only the $3$ . See Lloyd (2002), in which is cited Ptolemy’s Syntaxis,  I, chapter $1$ , $16$ . $17 - 21$ . $4$ . Compare René Thom’s comment in connection with his criticism of attempts to reduce mathematics to set theory: “In attempting to attach meaning to all the phrases constructed in ordinary languages, according to Boolean rules, the logician proceeds to a phantasmic, delirious reconstruction of the universe” (reprinted in Tymoczko 1998). $5$ .

Mathematics is not likely to collapse for lack of a coherent account of its certainty, but it may well collapse for lack of an account of its value. $2$ Postmodernism versus Mathematics? One danger that should not worry mathematicians is that of postmodernism. Many thousands of pages have been written on this topic, although it is not clear that the word designates anything specific.
I will nevertheless add a few pages of my own, because the term has come to be used as shorthand for a radical relativism that is thought to call into question not only certainty but rationality in all its forms. $6$ One thus finds mathematicians who are skeptical of certainty in Russell’s sense but who nonetheless express hostility to something they call “postmodernism” as they try to defend reason and the value of mathematics as a rational activity. Applied to architecture, postmodernism designates a reasonably precise tendency.
As a trend defining the spirit of the times, it has been called “the cultural logic of late capitalism,” differing from modernism by emphasizing space rather than time, multiple perspectives and fragmentation rather than unity of meaning and totality, pastiche (sampling) $7$ rather than progress, and much more along the same lines. As a movement in philosophy it is most typically (if abusively) associated with Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes, Jean-François Lyotard, and more generally the “French theory” of the $1960s$ and $1970s$ .
Postmodern prose is eclectic, ironic, self-referential, and hostile to linear narrative. The variant known as posthumanism celebrates the fading of conceptual and material boundaries between human beings and machines. We are all postmodernists insofar as we have experienced the degradation of public discourse under the influence of advertising slogans, and are therefore likely, in spite of ourselves, to read Jacobi’s invocation of “the honor of the human mind” as a precursor of that genre. Mathematicians can even claim to be the first postmodernists:
compare an art critic’s definition of postmodernism--“meaning is suspended in $6$ . For example, Lakoff and Núñez ( 2000 ) write of a “radical form of postmodernism which claims that mathematics is purely historically and culturally contingent and fundamentally subjective.” No examples are given of texts espousing this point of view. $7$ . “Because his ... artistry comes from combining other people’s art, ... the DJ is the epitome of a postmodern artist” (www . jahsonic . com $/$ postmodernism . html) .

9702003 ). The classic declaration of the latter kind is due to Bruno Latour and Stephen Woolgar: [W] e do not regard prior cognition ... as a necessary prerequisite for understanding scientists’ work. This is similar to an anthropologist’s refusal to bow before the knowledge of a primitive sorcerer. There are, as far as we know, no a priori reasons for supposing that scientists’ practice is more rational than that of outsiders.
Latour and Woolgar, Laboratory Life, $pp.29 - 30$ (Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1986 ) But one can also imagine sociologists paying serious attention to mathematicians’ accounts of their experience, addressing in the process the question that Weil did not.
For example, Bettina Heintz, in fieldwork at the Max-Planck-Institut in Bonn, which was billed as the first study of mathematics from the perspective of constructivist sociology of science, worries about “going native” and “over identifying with the dominant culture.” But her subject is the eminently sociological one of determining how mathematicians reach consensus, and her methodology, far from treating practicing mathematicians as “primitive sorcerers,” records their epistemic perspectives sympathetically and at length.
One has the impression that, in spite of the limitations of her methodology, Heintz is more interested in accounting for “real mathematics,” to which we shall return below, where as Bloor and Rosental are preoccupied with marshaling evidence to counter the metaphysical preoccupations of philosophers. Under siege from Gödel’s theorem, Popper’s attack on verificationism, Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions, Lakatos’s dialectical approach to the contents of knowledge in Proofs and Refutations, as well as Wittgenstein, certainty in Russell’s sense has largely been scrapped.
17 As for the social, philosophical, and spiritual needs that the notion of metaphysical certainty was designed to address, they remain. Thus, on the one hand, those with tendencies that I have $17$ . Lakatos’s posthumous “A renaissance of empiricism in the recent philosophy of mathematics,” presents a long series of quotations by mathematicians and a few philosophers, including Russell in 1924 , acknowledging that mathematics is uncertain, after all. Naturally, most of those cited refer directly or indirectly to Gödel’s theorem. The article was reprinted in Tymoczko ( 1998 ).
“Only dogma or theory has made people say that mathematics as a whole has a peculiar certainty,” writes Hacking ( 2000 ). Certainty persists, however, in the titles of philosophy books, e.g., Marcus Giaquinto’s optimistic The Search for Certainty: A Philosophical Account of Foundations of Mathematics (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004 ).

VIII. Final Perspectives

described as postmodernist continue to express skepticism regarding certainty, seemingly unaware that their target is now little more than an advertising slogan that has little to do with the real concerns of mathematicians; while, on the other hand, analytic philosophy has sought to substitute more flexible notions. The term “warrant,” for example, is used in an attempt by Philip Kitcher to develop a consistent account of mathematics on empirical rather than aprioristic grounds.
Kitcher recalls frege’s [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925) frustration with the mathematicians of his time, observing that, “When Frege emphasizes the possibility of complete clarity and certainty in mathematical knowledge, he is advancing a picture of mathematics that is almost irrelevant to the working mathematician” (Kitcher 1984 ). However, Kitcher and the SSK remain obsessed by the problem of “how our mathematical knowledge [is] acquired” (Kitcher 1984 ), where knowledge is taken to be true and justified belief.
Reading Heintz ( 2000 ), one learns that now, as in Frege’s day, mathematicians themselves widely consider these problems to be outdated or beside the point. The most controversial aspect of the SSK’s “strong programme,” formulated by Bloor and Barry Barnes, is the “thesis of symmetry”: the insistence that truth or falsity not be taken into account when investigating how a scientific claim comes to be accepted as knowledge.
Heintz’s fieldwork suggests that this is compatible with the view prevailing among mathematicians regarding acceptance of a mathematical proof, a “kind of consensus theory of truth” (Heintz 2000). 18 A striking instance of “how a mathematical proof comes to be accepted as knowledge” is playing out even as I am writing these lines. Grigori Perelman’s announced proof of the poincaré conjecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture) is under going unprecedented scrutiny in a small number of specialized centers, with the hope of determining the truth or falsity of Perelman’s claim.
This is going on completely beyond the spotlight of sociology, as far as I know, and with no guidance from philosophy, even though the 1000000 prize offered by the Clay $18$ . Heintz quotes Yu. I. Manin--“A proof only becomes a proof after the social act of ‘accepting it as a proof’ ”--as well as René Thom’s “community” theory of truth. One can of course always ask whether Heintz selectively quoted mathematicians whose positions support her thesis. This question can be asked of any sociological study, and it is best to let the sociologists work out their methodological issues.
An important remark, however: though Heintz’s original goal was to account for the formation of consensus among mathematicians within a science studies framework--with questionable success, but that is another matter--she does not defend a particular school within philosophy of mathematics. In this she differs from Bloor, for instance, who identifies himself explicitly as an empiricist.

of specialized texts in which the term plays a central role. I would like to argue that the nothing designated by “set” is some how different, and more fruitful, than the nothing designated by “essence.” But the means at my disposal for making such an argument take the form of mathematical reasoning, which leads me, at best, to a vicious circle. 25 More bluntly, and for reasons akin to those Serre invoked in his Libération interview, I cannot be satisfied with an answer that is less certain than the sort of answer mathematics provides;
for a mathematician, a pragmatist answer to Weil’s question is an admission of defeat. And yet I am aware that (metaphysically certain) grounds for distinguishing mathematical certainty from pragmatic certainty are lacking! Another, possibly more profound, reason to steer clear of speculation is that, where as philosophy presents itself as a dialogue extending over millennia, so that to understand each new contribution one would ideally be familiar with all previous contributions, mathematics is in principle supposed to be derivable by pure reason from a small number of axioms.
A philosophical proposition, in other words, remains attached to its origins and context; a mathematical proposition floats free. This principle, an important constituent of the aura of metaphysical certainty surrounding mathematics, does not in fact bear much resemblance to mathematics as it is actually practiced--“one of humankind’s longest conversations,” as Barry Mazur puts it.
I am nonetheless painfully aware that my personal “conversation” with the philosophical tradition is thoroughly unreliable, and my choice of footnotes is primarily the fruit of a random walk (or random surf, or remix) among scraps of the literature I have happened to encounter. If I am nevertheless writing about philosophy, it is in large part because of a question that was put to me in 1995 , during a presentation of Wiles’s proof of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) to an audience of scientists.
An October 1993 article in Scientific American entitled “The death of proof” had called Wiles’s proof a “splendid anachronism,” citing Laszlo Babai and his collaborators, among others, in support of the thesis that, in the future, deductive proof in mathematics will be largely supplanted by computer-assisted proofs and probabilistic arguments. That same month $25$ . “Truth is always the possibility of its proper destruction,” according to the (nonpostmodern) French philosopher, Alain Badiou, taking Gödel’s theorem as an example (www . egs .

VIII. Final Perspectives

the Notices of the American Mathematical Society ( $40$ : $978 - 81)$ published Doron Zeilberger’s manifesto “Theorems for a price,” predicting a rapid transition from rigorous proofs to an “age of semi-rigorous mathematics, in which identities (and perhaps other kinds of theorems) will carry price tags” measured in computer time and proportional to the degree of certainty desired, to be followed in turn by “abandoning the task of keeping track of price altogether, and ... the metamorphosis to non-rigorous mathematics” (John Horgan, Scientific American October 1993 : $92 - 102)$ .
26 Feeling called upon to answer the question Weil avoided, I argued that the basic unit of mathematics is the concept rather than the theorem, that the purpose of a proof is to illuminate a concept rather than merely confirm a theorem, and that the replacement of deductive proofs by probabilistic or mechanical proofs should be compared not to the introduction of a new technology for producing shoes, say, but rather to the attempt to replace shoes by the sales receipts, or perhaps the cash profits, of the shoe factory. The audience had its own question: Was I talking about certainty?
Of course not. That option has been philosophically discredited, as I have tried to explain. And other normative prescriptions fall victim no less easily to the laughter of philosophers. On the other hand, I see no pragmatic reason why probabilistic or mechanical proofs would not suit the five goals on the AMS committee’s list just as well as deductive proofs, nor any sociological reason why they should not be as effective in commanding consensus in the event of a paradigm shift. So what was I talking about?
Such a question, at this point in the essay, practically begs to be answered by an advertising slogan. For example: The practice of making what one writes “reliable and verifiable” fosters critical thinking in general. This is a popular argument for teaching proofs, and is probably even true, but how would one go about verifying such a claim? I am very much tempted to say that the concepts that serve as material for “one $26$ .
In the pop posthumanist scenarios promoted by Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil, and the like, computers acquire all human capabilities, including the ability to generate and prove theorems--for some reason this is always considered a landmark--by the middle of the twentyfirst century. The distinction between humans and computers subsequently fades away rather rapidly, making Zeilberger’s prediction moot. A more recent, and much more nuanced, discussion of prospects for automatic theorem proving has been posted on the Internet by Maggesi and Simpson (undated) .

Human mathematicians pride themselves on producing beautiful, clear, explanatory proofs, and devote much of their effort to reworking results in conceptually illuminating ways. Philosophers must not evade their duty to treat these value judgments in mathematics. They also have a duty, it seems to me, to account for terms like “idea” and “intuition”--and “conceptual” for that matter. An answer to the question “Why philosophy?” might well begin there.

Postscript

In December 2004 my university joined a number of other institutions in France and elsewhere in hosting a traveling UNESCO-sponsored exhibition entitled “Pourquoi les mathématiques?” Hoping to learn the answer before my submission deadline, I spent a few hours at the exhibition. It was clever and engaging, presenting a variety of (pure) mathematical ideas with a sprinkling of practical applications, but in no way did it address the “Pourquoi?” of the title.
An organizer was on hand, and when I turned to her for guidance she explained that the French title was a solution to a problem of translation. The English title, which came first, was “Experiencing mathematics.” This, she assured me, has no adequate French translation, so “Pourquoi les mathématiques?” was chosen as the best substitute. Maybe the solution to the problem of my title is simply to accept the translation in the opposite direction. Even the most ruthless funding agency is not yet so post-human as to require an answer to “Why experience?” $34$ Acknowledgments.
I thank Cathérine Goldstein and Norbert Schappacher for pointing me in the directions of the Rosental and Heintz books, among other source material, and for vigorously criticizing my project as well as its execution. I also thank Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel for explaining the title of the UNESCO exhibition and Ian Hacking for critically reading an earlier version of the manuscript with tolerance and rigor. David Corfield receives thanks for several helpful clarifications.
Barry Mazur is thanked especially warmly for many suggestions, much encouragement, for help with the title, and most of all for showing, in his Imagining Numbers, that there is at least one way out of the fly-bottle. $34$ . Or, as Weyl put it, “with [mathematics] we stand precisely at the point of intersection of restraint and freedom that makes up the essence of man itself.” Note the word “essence” (see Mancosu 1998 ). I thank David Corfield for this quotation.
