# The Art of Problem Solving

VIII . $1$ The Art of Problem Solving

A. Gardiner

Where there are problems, there is life.

Zinoviev (1980)

In English the word “problem” has negative connotations, suggesting some unwanted and unresolved tension. Zinoviev’s reminder is therefore important: problems are the stuff of life--and of mathematics. Good problems focus the mind: they challenge and frustrate; they cultivate ambition and humility; they show up the limitations of what we know, and highlight potential sources of more powerful ideas. By contrast, the word “solving” suggests a release of tension.
The juxtaposition of these two words in the expression “problem solving” may encourage the naive to think that this unwelcome tension can be massaged away by means of some “magic formula” or process. It cannot; there is no magic formula. Why don’t we tell the truth? No one has the faintest idea how the process ... works, and in calling it a “process” we may be already making a dangerous assumption. Gian-Carlo Rota, in Kac et al.
( 1986 ) A “problem” is something that one wants to understand, to explain, or to solve, but which eludes one’s initial attempts to classify it as being of some familiar “type.” The experience of being confronted by such a “problem” is inevitably unsettling: it may eventually prove to be more familiar than one thought, but the would-be solver is initially dumped in terrain with few signposts or marked tracks.
Some (such as Pólya and his recent followers) have tried to devise a universal “problem-solving meta-map.” But in reality there is no easy alternative to that painful immersion so familiar to generations of postgraduate students. Grand general principles can help to make sense of this experience, but are unlikely to take us very

far. Consider, for example, the four general principles formulated by descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) in his Discourse on Method. The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such. The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution. The third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend ... step by step to the knowledge of the more complex. And the last ...
to make enumerations so complete ... that I might be assured that nothing was omitted. Descartes’s rules are worth pondering. But it is hard to accept that it was the systematic application of these four rules that led to Descartes’s almost single-handed creation of analytic geometry as we know them today! In the detailed working out of the creative process, problem-specific “know-how” distilled from endless hands-on experience is likely to be far more important than any general principles. What then can one usefully say?
To describe the “art of problem solving” in impressive-sounding detail would be irresponsible. But to say nothing would be misleading. Both options are unsatisfactory--yet these two responses are what students, teachers, and would-be mathematicians are most likely to meet! Attempts to teach “problem-solving” in schools often misconstrue mathematics as a kind of “subjective pattern-spotting.” Instead of correcting this distortion at university level, mathematicians often maintain a discreet public silence about the very private matter of how serious mathematical problems actually get solved.
Hence, in addressing the theme for readers with a mathematical bent, this article has to start largely from scratch, and to proceed slowly. So we begin with a warning. The subject of problem solving is well worth exploring, but we shall proceed obliquely and our conclusions will often remain implicit. Along the way we shall meet extracts from a number of sources-- which may be viewed as an initial reading list for those

who wish to pursue the theme in greater detail, provided they never forget that the only way to gain true insight into a craft is through practicing the craft itself. Mathematics may be “the queen of the sciences,” but the art of doing mathematics remains a craft, passed on in the ancient craft tradition, through painful initiation. A number of collections of problems at various levels--often using relatively elementary material--are listed in the references. Here we make do with a single example. Problem.
For all positive integers $n$ and $k$, show that some triangular number is congruent to k (mod $2$ n). The reader is encouraged to explore this problem before reading on, noting any obvious stages along the way: from initial bewilderment, through an exploratory  /  organization phase, eventually culminating in a solution and an attempt to locate this isolated challenge in some broader mathematical context.
Mathematics is a largely unexplored “mental universe,” whose initial exploration and charting, subsequent colonization, routine traverse, and efficient administration correspond, in many ways, to the realworld adventures of geographical explorers in former centuries. To strike out beyond the security of the oldworld coastline, to imagine and explore something new, takes intellectual courage. Most prominent among these mathematical explorers are the “system builders,” who identify new mathematical continents, or who uncover profound and unexpected bridges joining known lands.
Their initial motivation may stem from a specific problem, whose analysis provides hints of the outline of previously undiscerned structures; but the system builder’s focus then switches to the bigger picture: trying to identify, and to clarify, connections between the structures that underlie “mathematics in the large.” Such ventures often end up with little to show for them-- they may come close to discovering some mathematical El Dorado, but they lack the gold to prove it. Some of these explorers may later be singled out as major prophets or discoverers, but such recognition can be fickle:
those so honored may not have been the first to see their particular promised land; they may not have appreciated the significance of what they had stumbled upon, or of how it would eventually be seen to link known mathematical lands; their success may have depended on earlier attempts by others; and their bounty may not have impressed their contemporaries as deeply as we now imagine.

VIII. Final Perspectives

Each triumph of the system builders is rooted in detailed knowledge of “mathematics in the small,” which may derive from work in a very different mathematical style--such as that of the mathematical beachcomber, who is most at home exploring the known mathematical shoreline, using some sixth sense to spot suspicious-looking rocks, under which are hidden intricate, and totally unexpected, microworlds on our very doorstep.
While great explorers range further and further afield, they leave behind annoying gaps, or unsolved problems, which represent significant lacunas in our understanding--gaps that some future beachcomber may one day explain, so opening the way for some new synthesis. The system builder and the beachcomber represent very different mental styles; but their contributions complement each other. In our evolving picture of the mathematical universe, insights on a small scale and on a large scale must somehow fit together.
Hence the beachcomber’s chance discoveries may contribute in unexpected ways to our future conception of the large-scale mathematical universe. Such differing styles should be borne in mind as we strive to make our introductory comments more specific. Our first attempt is based on a version of Alain Connes’s three levels of mathematical activity. The first [level] is defined by the faculty of calculation-- being able to apply a given algorithm rapidly and reliably. . . .
The second level begins when the actual method of calculation is adapted to, and criticized in the context of, a particular problem. . . . In mathematics this is what often makes it possible to solve problems that aren’t too difficult or that don’t require any new ideas. . . . The third level [is] the level at which the mind, or rather conscious thought, is occupied with another task while the problem in question is being solved ... subconsciously. . . . At [the third] level it isn’t only a matter of solving a given problem; it is also possible to discover ...
a part of mathematics to which the [previously] existing corpus gives no direct access. Alain Connes, in Changeux and Connes ( 1995 ) Connes’s first level focuses on the development of robust technique--that is, fluency, accuracy, and confidence in using given procedures in relatively standard ways. We say no more about work on this level except to stress its importance! Discussion about the “art of problem solving” presupposes, and only makes sense in the context of, appropriate robust technique.
Connes’s second level includes most, but by no means all, of the serious mathematics that mathematicians engage in on a daily basis. Genuine problems

The Art of Problem Solving

occur on this level in different guises, ranging from (i) challenges designed to stretch the young wouldbe mathematician (in high school geometry, in puzzle books and problem-solving journals, in Olympiads, etc., whose material is designed to force the would-be solver to select, to adapt, and to combine known methods in unexpected ways), to (ii) genuine research problems that can be tackled and largely solved by selecting, adapting, and combining known methods in a suitably imaginative way.
In our problem about triangular numbers, the first level includes the immediate translation from words into symbols to obtain the congruence $m(m - 1)/2$ ≡ k  (  mod $2^{n})$ , or $m(m - 1)$ ≡ $2k($ mod $2^{n} + {}^{1})$ , which, for arbitrary given $n \ge 1$ , has to be solved for all $k \ge 1$ . The second level might then include a systematic attempt to make sense of what happens for small values of n, leading to the formulation of simple conjectures whose proofs would solve the problem, followed by moves to devise the necessary proofs.
It is tempting to think of Connes’s third level as “inscrutable,” in the spirit of the following extract: In science, as well as in other fields of human endeavor, there are two kinds of geniuses: the “ordinary” and the “magicians.” An ordinary genius is a fellow that you or I would be just as good as if we were only many times better [than we are]. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with the magicians. They are ...
in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes in com pre he ns i ble. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely in the dark. They seldom if ever have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating to cope with the mysterious ways in which a magician’s mind works. Kac (1985) However, one would then expect activity on this level to be so idiosyncratic as to be irrelevant to ordinary mortals.
In fact, the most valuable insights we have into “the art of problem solving” derive from personal testimony about work on this level by precisely such “magicians” as poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912), which suggests that there are clear parallels between the experience of the very best mathematicians on Connes’s third level and what happens when ordinary students, or mathematicians, operate “out of their depth” when tackling more mundane problems; that is, when their own fumbling requires them to work in regions

to which their own “existing corpus gives no direct access.” In our problem about triangular numbers this might occur when a solver who has never met “congruences for binomial   coefficients” manages to adapt the naive proof for   m n ${}^{2} ($ mod 2) to cover the m slightly more awkward ${}^{3} ($ mod $2^{n})$ , and realizes that, though this naive approach does not extend even to m n ${}^{4} ($ mod 2) , something more general may be lurking in the darkness.
Thus we use the word “problem” to refer to a serious mathematical challenge on at least Connes’s second level, where this is to be interpreted in the spirit of activity on Connes’s second and third levels. So any analysis of the art of mathematical problem solving must somehow reflect experience on these two higher levels. By contrast, the educational assumptions that underpin most attempts to bring “problem-solving” to the classroom generally try to reduce this subtle process to a set of rules in the spirit of Connes’s first level! A problem is much more than just a hard exercise.
Consider the question, When is a “problem” not a problem? One answer is clearly, When it is too easy! However, many students and teachers are tempted to reject unfamiliar or mildly confusing problems because they appear to be too hard. This is an understandable reaction only where mathematics is limited to a succession of predictable exercises. Most of us learn mathematics as a collection of standard techniques, which we use to solve standard problems in predictable contexts (Connes ’ s first level). Like the athlete or musician, the mathematics student needs to develop technique.
However, as the athlete trains in order to compete, and the musician practices in order to make music, so the mathematician needs technique in order to make mathematics by tackling challenging problems. Each new piece of printed music may initially strike the beginner as a confusing array of black blobs. But as they work on the piece, phrase by phrase, it slowly takes on a shape of its own, revealing internal connections that may previously have been over looked. Much the same is true when we confront an unfamiliar mathematical problem. At first sight we may not even understand the question.
But as we struggle to make sense of the problem, we regularly find that, little by little, the fog begins to lift. Two rats fell into a can of milk. After swimming for a time one of them realized his hopeless fate and drowned. The other persisted, and at last the milk was turned to butter and he could get out.

In the first part of the war, Miss Cartwright and I got drawn into van der Pol’s equation. . . . [W] e went on and on ... with no earthly prospect of “results”: suddenly the entire vista of the dramatic fine structure of solutions stared us in the face. Littlewood (1986) In 1923 hardy [VI.73](/part-06/godfrey-harold-hardy-18771947) and littlewood [VI.79](/part-06/john-edensor-littlewood-18851977) made a conjecture about the number of arithmetic progressions (APs) of length k among the primes. One potential corollary was that the prime numbers must contain arbitrarily long APs.
Faced with such a claim it is natural to start looking for APs which consist entirely of primes! But if you try, you will soon approach the limits of what is known: the first three odd primes, $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , form a very familiar AP of length three, but longer APs are surprisingly elusive (in 2004 the record for an AP of distinct primes had length twenty-three, with both the primes themselves and the step size being astronomical). Despite this unpromising lack of evidence, in 2004 Ben Green and Terence Tao proved that the set of prime numbers does indeed contain arbitrarily long APs.
Their proof is a fine example of the way in which significant progress often combines a detailed reevaluation of known results (in this case a deep result of Szemer é di), lateral thinking (they embed the primes not in the integers, but in a natural but sparser set of “almost primes” of which the primes constitute a nonzero fraction), and the determination and ingenuity to make such ideas deliver the goods.
It remains a serious challenge to capture the essence of Littlewood’s experience (where the fog suddenly lifts) in a form that is suitable for relative beginners, whether through time-constrained problems (see Barbeau 1989 ; Gardiner 1997 ; Lovasz 1979) , or through structured investigations (see Gardiner 1987 ; Ringel 1974 ). In the year in which Green and Tao announced their proof, the British Mathematical Olympiad posed the following problem, which readers are encouraged to tackle. Problem. In an AP of seven distinct primes, what is the smallest possible value of the largest prime?
This challenge could enliven any introductory number theory course, as well as providing a natural link to recent developments. For the novice it is far from obvious how to begin, but the basic idea is elementary and should be “known” (in some sense), and can be used to generate natural APs of lengths $4$ , $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , $8$ , provided that one accepts the value of carrying out extensive computations quickly and intelligently.

VIII. Final Perspectives

A great discovery solves a great problem. But there is a grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery. Such experiences at a susceptible age may create a taste for mental work and leave their imprint on mind and character for a lifetime. From the preface to the first printing of Pólya (2004) Pólya is, if anything, too reticent here.
The important distinction is not between that which is “known” and that which is truly “original,” but rather between mathematical activity in the spirit of Connes’s first level and mathematical activity in the spirit of Connes’s second and third levels. Any introduction to this distinction is inevitably through problems whose solution is known to someone, so we should collect and use good “modest problems,” not apologize for them. Ulam puts it more directly. I learned chess from my father. . . .
The moves of the knight fascinated me, especially the way two enemy pieces can be threatened simultaneously with one knight. Although it is a simple stratagem, I thought it was marvelous, and I have loved the game ever since. Could the same process apply to the talent for mathematics? A child by chance has some satisfying experiences with numbers; then he experiments further and enlarges his memory by building up a store of experiences.
Ulam (1991) Children also find delight--if less profound and more short-lived--in the discovery that one can set up a “corner move” in the children’s game noughts and crosses (tictac - toe) so as to simultaneously threaten to complete two lines-of-three, at most one of which can be countered.
This delight in a double-edged strategy, which points in two directions at once, has much in common with the pleasure we derive from (i) puns and double entendres in ordinary language, in humor, and in poetry, (ii) the almost physical response when we recognize subtle variations on a theme in music, and (iii) the more cerebral appreciation we feel when we meet counting methods based on unanticipated isomorphisms, or the essentially two-faced idea of “proof by contradiction” in mathematics.
This enjoyment of hidden ambiguities and double meanings is related to the evident (but poorly understood) way in which analogy guides, and delights, mathematicians of all ages.

purely logical processes. “There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can find it by pure reason.” As in most printed mathematics, Hilbert offered no psychological guidance on how to proceed. Those who took up Hilbert’s challenge were expected to discover such things for themselves. Like every social activity, mathematics has a “front” and a “back”: the front is where the finished products are displayed for public consumption, while the back is where the real work is done in less presentable surroundings.
A naive realist might view the front as a mere facade, insist that all serious “problem solving” goes on “out back,” and declare this separation to be artificial. Sometime, in a future that is knocking at our door, we shall have to retrain ourselves and our children to properly tell the truth. The exercise will be particularly painful in mathematics. The enrapturing discoveries of our field systematically conceal, like footprints erased in the sand, the analogical train of thought that is the authentic life of mathematics. . . .
Until that day, however, the truths of mathematics will make only fleeting appearances, like shameful confessions whispered to a priest, to a psychiatrist, or to a wife. In the nineteenth chapter of “The Betrothed,” Manzoni describes as follows the one genuine moment in a conversation between astute Milanese diplomats: “It was as if, between acts in the performance of an opera, the curtain were to be raised too soon, and the spectators were given a glimpse of a half-dressed soprano screaming at the tenor.” Gian-Carlo Rota, in Kac et al.
( 1986 ) However, the prospect of some mathematical equivalent of being obliged to witness “a half-dressed soprano screaming at the tenor” should cause us to hesitate before embracing Rota’s vision of the future. The front-back metaphor is due to the sociologist Erving Goffman. One standard example is that of a restaurant. We tend to think of a restaurant in terms of what we see “out front,” where the manners, food, and language are “all dressed up”;
but everything we see out front is totally dependent on the raw heat, the steam and grease, the conflicts and curses “out back” in the kitchen--where the hard work is done to tight deadlines and in very different conditions. The triumph of mathematics in the modern world has been largely due to the fact that these two worlds-- the front and the back--have been deliberately and systematically separated. It may seem curious that we have no agreed way of discussing the dynamics of the mathematical kitchen; but mathematics has grown

VIII. Final Perspectives

largely because its practitioners have learned to separate its objective results, and the way they are validated and presented, from the intriguing, but inscrutable (and ultimately irrelevant !) subjective alchemy through which these mathematical results are conjured up. This formal separation has led to the adoption of a universally communicable format, which transcends personal taste and style, and which can therefore be comprehended, checked, and improved by anyone.
Any move to pay greater attention to the mental, physical, and emotional dynamics that underlie mathematical problem solving must understand the need for this separation and respect the formal world of “objective” mathematics. There are intriguing insights into the human dynamics of the mathematical kitchen scattered through out the mathematical literature. One such insight is the fact that different mathematicians may have very different styles, even though most of these differences are rarely discussed. One example is the perceived role of memory. Some mathematicians value memory highly.
It seems to me that a good memory--at least for mathematicians and physicists--forms a large part of their talent. And what we call talent or perhaps genius itself depends to a large extent on the ability to use one’s memory properly to find the analogies, past, present and future, which, as Banach said, are essential to the development of new ideas. Ulam (1991) Others have an excellent memory for anything within their own field of interest, but have considerable difficulty storing information from outside that domain in an easily retrievable form.
And many would-be mathematicians are drawn to the subject precisely because they see it as requiring markedly less memorizing than most other disciplines. The important point would seem to be not how much one remembers, but what one makes automatic, and how accessibly this and other information is stored. It is clearly worth making a serious effort to organize in one’s mind that material which is central to one’s own work--so that it is available for instant use.
It is also important, as we shall see, to collect a penumbra of possibly useful ideas, information, and examples--so that the mind is in a position to make incidental connections which might be fruitful. But it is not necessarily wise to learn in a uniform way everything that might conceivably be needed for the problem at hand: knowing slightly less sometimes forces the mind to get by on less, and hence to be more ingenious or inventive.

one class of Fuchsian functions, those that are derived from the hypergeometric series. I had only to verify the results, which only took a few hours. Poincaré (1908) I had been struggling for two months to prove a result I was pretty sure was true. When ... walking up a Swiss mountain, fully occupied by the effort, a very odd device emerged--so odd that though it worked I could not grasp the resulting proof as a whole. . . . I had a sense that my subconscious was saying, “Are you never going to do it, confound you;
try this.” Littlewood (1986) The resulting sense of satisfaction is familiar even to those whose mathematical experience is limited. Illumination is not only marked by the pleasure-- the exhilaration!--one inevitably experiences at the moment it strikes, but also by the relief one suddenly feels at seeing a fog abruptly lift, and disappear. Alain Connes in Changeux and Connes ( 1995 ) However, after months of hard work, such intoxication can sometimes be deceptive. In mathematics one cannot stop at drawing with a big, wide brush; all the details have to be filled in at some time.
Ulam (1991) The verification, or working-out, process often appears mundane; but it is rarely routine, and regularly reveals hidden subtleties that force us to reassess the anticipated approach. Unforeseen difficulties may remain unresolved, and we may be obliged reluctantly to begin the cycle all over again. It is tempting to think of this as “failure.” But mathematics is not a mere machine for solving problems; it is a way of life. In their different ways success and failure both send us back to the drawing board--as Gauss observed in a letter to bolyai [VI.34] in 1808 .
It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again; the never-satisfied man is so strange-- if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others. $965$ Further Reading Barbeau, E. 1989 . Polynomials. New York: Springer.
