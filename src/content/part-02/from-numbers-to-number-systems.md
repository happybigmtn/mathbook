# From Numbers to Number Systems

II.1 From Numbers to
     Number Systems

People have been writing numbers down for as long as
they have been writing. In every civilization that has
developed a way of recording information, we also find
a way of recording numbers. Some scholars even argue
that numbers came first.
  It is fairly clear that numbers first arose as adjectives:
they specified how many or how much of something
there was. Thus, it was possible to talk about three
apricots, say, long before it was possible to talk about
the number 3. But once the concept of “threeness” is
on the table, so that the same adjective specifies three
fish and three horses, and once a written symbol such
as “3” is developed that can be used in all of those
instances, the conditions exist for 3 itself to emerge
as an independent entity. Once it does, we are doing
mathematics.
  This process seems to have repeated itself many
times when new kinds of numbers have been intro-
duced: first a number is used, then it is represented
symbolically, and finally it comes to be conceived as a
thing in itself and as part of a system of similar entities.

The earliest mathematical documents we know about
go back to the civilizations of the ancient Middle East,
in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. In both cultures, a scribal
class developed. Scribes were responsible for keeping
records, which often required them to do arithmetic
and solve simple mathematical problems. Most of the
mathematical documents we have from those cultures
seem to have been created for the use of young scribes
learning their craft. Many of them are collections of

problems, provided with either answers or brief solu-
tions: twenty-five problems about digging trenches in
one tablet, twelve problems requiring the solution of
a linear equation in another, problems about squares

and their sides in a third.
Numbers were used both for counting and for mea-
suring, so a need for fractional numbers must have
come up fairly early. Fractions are complicated to write
down, and computing with them can be difficult. Hence,
the problem of “broken numbers” may well have been
the first really challenging mathematical problem. How
does one write down fractions? The Egyptians and
the Mesopotamians came up with strikingly different
answers, both of which are also quite different from
the way we write them today.
In Egypt (and later in Greece and much of the Mediter-
ranean world), the fundamental notion was “the nth
part,” as in “the third part of six is two.” In this lan-
guage, one would express the idea of dividing 7 by 3
as, “What is the third part of seven?” The answer is,
“Two and the third.” The process was complicated by an
additional restriction: one never recorded a final result
using more than one of the same kind of part. Thus, the
number we would want to express as “two fifth parts”
would have to be given as “the third and the fifteenth.”
In Mesopotamia, we find a very different idea, which
may have arisen to allow easy conversion between dif-
ferent kinds of units. First of all, the Babylonians had a
1   Numbers in Early Mathematics
way to generate symbols for all the numbers from 1 to
59. For larger numbers, they used a positional system
much like the one we use today, but based on 60 rather
than 10. So something like 1, 20 means one sixty and
twenty units, that is, 1 . imes 60 + 20 = 80. The same system
was then extended to fractions, so that one half was
represented as thirty sixtieths. It is convenient to mark
the beginning of the fractional part with a semicolon,
though this and the comma are a modern convention
that has no counterpart in the original texts. Then, for

78

example, 1;24,36 means 1 + 24
more usually write as 100 , or 1.41. The Mesopotamian
way of writing numbers is called a sexagesimal place-
value system by analogy with the system we use today,
which is, of course, a decimal place-value system.
   Neither of these systems is really equipped to deal
well with complicated numbers. In Mesopotamia, for
example, only finite sexagesimal expressions were em-
ployed, so the scribes were not able to write down an
exact value for the reciprocal of 7 because there is no
finite sexagesimal expression for 17 . In practice, this
meant that to divide by 7 required finding an approx i-
mate answer. The Egyptian “parts” system, on the other
hand, can represent any positive rational number, but
doing so may require a sequence of denominators that
to our eyes looks very complicated. One of the sur-
viving papyri includes problems that look designed to
produce just such complicated answers. One of these
answers is “14, the 4 th, the 56 th, the 97 th, the 194 th,
the 388 th, the 679 th, the 776 th,” which in modern nota-
tion is the fraction 14 28
putation for its own sake became well-established very
early in the development of mathematics.
   Mediterranean civilizations preserved both of these
systems for a while. Most everyday numbers were spec-
ified using the system of “parts.” On the other hand,
astronomy and navigation required more precision, so
the sexagesimal system was used in those fields. This
included measuring time and angles. The fact that we
still divide an hour into sixty minutes and a minute into
sixty seconds goes back, via the Greek astronomers,
to the Babylonian sexagesimal fractions; almost four
thousand years later, we are still influenced by the
Babylonian scribes.

Things get more complicated with the mathematics
of classical Greek and Hellenistic civilizations. The
Greeks, of course, are famous for coming up with
the first mathematical proofs. They were the first to
attempt to do mathematics in a rigorously deductive
way, using clear initial assumptions and careful state-
ments. This, perhaps, is what led them to be very
careful about numbers and their relations to other
magnitudes.
  Some time before the fourth century b.c.e., the Greeks
made the fundamental discovery of “incommensurable
magnitudes.” That is, they discovered that it is not
always possible to express two given lengths as (inte-
ger) multiples of a third length. It is not just that lengths   comparable with the others.

36
60 + 602 , which we would      and numbers are conceptually distinct things (though
141
this was important too). The Greeks had found a proof
that one cannot use numbers to represent lengths.
Suppose, they argued, you have two line segments.
If their lengths are both given by numbers, then those
numbers will at worst involve some fractions. By chang-
ing the unit of length, then, we can make sure that both
of the lengths correspond to whole numbers. In other
words, it must be possible to choose a unit length so
that each of our segments consists of a whole number
multiple of the unit. The two segments, then, could be
“measured together,” i.e., would be “commensurable.”
Now here’s the catch: the Greeks could prove that this
was not always the case. Their standard example had to
do with the side and the diagonal of a square. We do not
know exactly how they first established that these two
segments are not commensurable, but it might have
been something like this: if you subtract the side from
the diagonal, you will get a segment shorter than either
of them; if both side and diagonal are measured by a
97 . It seems that the joy of com-      common unit, then so is the difference. Now repeat the
argument: take the remainder and subtract it from the
side until we get a second remainder smaller than the
first (it can be subtracted twice, in fact). The second
remainder will also be measured by the common unit.
It turns out to be quite easy to show that this process
will never terminate; instead, it will produce smaller and
smaller remainder segments. Eventually, the remainder
segment will be smaller than the unit that supposedly
measures it a whole number of times. That is impossi-
ble (no whole number is smaller than 1, after all), and
hence we can conclude that the common unit does not,
in fact, exist.
Of course, the diagonal does in fact have a length.
Today, we would say that if the length of the side is
2   Lengths Are Not Numbers
one unit, then the length of the diagonal is 2 units,
and we would interpret this argument as showing that
√
the number 2 is not a fraction. The Greeks did not
√
quite see in what sense 2 could be a number. Instead,
it was a length, or, even better, the ratio between the
length of the diagonal and the length of the side. Sim-
ilar arguments could be applied to other lengths; for
example, they knew that the side of a square of area 1
and a square of area 10 are incommensurable.
The conclusion, then, is that lengths are not numbers:
instead, they are some other kind of magnitude. But
now we are faced with a proliferation of magnitudes:
numbers, lengths, areas, angles, volumes, etc. Each of
these must be taken as a different kind of quantity, not

$II$ . $1$ .

From Numbers to Number Systems

This is a problem for geometry, particularly if we want to measure things. The Greeks solved this problem by relying heavily on the notion of a ratio. Two quantities of the same type have a ratio, and this ratio was allowed to be equal to the ratio of two quantities of another type: equality of two ratios was defined using Eudoxus’s theory of proportion, the latter being one of the most important and deep ideas of Greek geometry.
So, for example, rather than talking about a number called $\pi$ , which to them would not be a number at all, they would say that “the ratio of the circle to the square on its radius is the same as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.” Notice that one of the two ratios is between two areas, the other between two lengths. The number $\pi$ itself had no name in Greek mathematics, but the Greeks did compare it with ratios between numbers:
archimedes [VI.3](/part-06/archimedes-ca) showed that it was just a little bit less than the ratio of $22$ to $7$ and just a little bit more than the ratio of $223$ to $71$ . Doing things this way seems ungainly to us, but it worked very well. Further more, it is philosophically satisfying to conceive of a great variety of magnitudes organized into various kinds (segments , angles, surfaces, etc .) . Magnitudes of the same kind can be related to one another by ratios, and ratios can be compared with each other because they are relations perceived by our minds.
In fact, the word for ratio, both in Greek and in Latin, is the same as the word for “reason” or “explanation” (logos in Greek, ratio in Latin). From the beginning, “irrational” (alogos in Greek) could mean both “with out a ratio” and “unreasonable.” Inevitably, this austere theoretical system was some what disconnected from the everyday needs of people who needed to measure things such as lengths and angles. Astronomers kept right on using sexagesimal approximations, as did mapmakers and other scientists. There was some “leakage” of course:
in the first century c.e., Heron of Alexandria wrote a book that reads like an attempt to apply the theoreticians’ discoveries to practical measurement. It is to him, for

$22$

example, that we owe the recommendation to us$e^{7}$ as an approximation for $\pi$ . (Presumably , he chose Archimedes’ upper bound because it was the simpler number .) In theoretical mathematics, however, the distinction between numbers and other kinds of magnitudes remained firm. The history of numbers in the West over the fifteen hundred years that followed the classical Greek period can be seen as having two main themes: first, the Greek

$79$

compartmentalization between different kinds of quantities was slowly demolished; second, in order to do this the notion of number had to be generalized over and over again.

$3$

Decimal Place Value

Our system for representing whole numbers goes back, ultimately, to the mathematicians of the Indian subcontinent. Some time before (probably well before) the fifth century c.e., they created nine symbols to designate the numbers from one to nine and used the position of these symbols to indicate their actual value. So $a_{3}$ in the units position meant three, and $a_{3}$ in the tens position meant three tens, i.e., thirty. This, of course, is what we still do; the symbols themselves have changed, but not the principle.
At about the same time, a place marker was developed to indicate an unoccupied space; this eventually evolved into our zero. Indian astronomy made extensive use of sines, which are almost never whole numbers. To represent these, a Babylonian-style sexagesimal system was used, with each “sexagesimal unit” being represented using the decimal system. So “thirty-three and a quarter” might be represented as 3315 , i.e., $33$ units and $15$ “minutes” (sixtieths). Decimal place-value numeration was passed on from India to the Islamic world fairly early. In the ninth century c.e.
in Baghdad, the recently established capital of the caliphate, one finds al-khwārizmı̄ [VI.5](/part-06/abu-jafar-muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizm-vi55-william-kingdon-cliord-18451879) writing a treatise on numeration in the Indian style, “using nine symbols.” Several centuries later, al-Khwārizmı̄’s treatise was translated into Latin. It was so popular and influential in late-medieval Europe that decimal numeration was often referred to as “algorism.” It is worth noting that in al-Khwārizmı̄’s writing zero still had a special status: it was a place holder, not a number.
But once we have a symbol, and we start doing arithmetic using these symbols, the distinction quickly disappears. We have to know how to add and multiply numbers by zero in order to multiply multidigit numbers. In this way, “nothing” slowly became a number.

What People Want Is a Number

As Greek culture was displaced by other influences, the practical tradition became more important. One can see this in al-Khwārizmı̄’s other famous book, whose title

80

gave us the word “algebra.” The book is actually a com-
pen dium of many different kinds of practical or semi-
practical mathematics problems. Al-Khwārizmı̄ opens
the book with a declaration that tells us at once that we     De Thiende (“The tenth”), which was first published in
are no longer in the Greek mathematical world: “When
I considered what people generally want in calculating,
I found that it is always a number.”
   The first portion of al-Khwārizmı̄’s book deals with
quadratic equations and with the algebraic manipula-
tions (done entirely in words, with no symbols whatso-
ever) needed to deal with them. His procedure is exactly
the quadratic formula we still use, which of course
requires extracting a square root. But in every example
the number whose square root we need to find turns
out to be a square, so that the square root is easily
found—and al-Khwārizmı̄ does get a number!
   At other points in the book, however, we can see
that al-Khwārizmı̄ is beginning to think of irrational
square roots as number-like entities. He teaches the
reader how to manipulate symbols with square roots
in them, and gives (in words, of course) examples such

as (20− 200)+( 200−10) = 10. In the second part of
the book, which deals with geometry and measurement,
one even sees an approximation to a square root: “The
product is one thousand eight hundred and seventy-
five; take its root, it is the area; it is forty-three and a   that all (positive) numbers were squares, cubes, fourth
little.”
   The mathematicians of medieval Islam were influ-
enced not only by the practical tradition represented
by al-Khwārizmı̄, but also by the Greek tradition, espe-     used for irrational numbers, i.e., numbers that are not
cially euclid’s [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) Elements. One finds in their writ-
ing a mixture of Greek precision and a more prac-
tical approach to measurement. In Omar Khayyam’s
Algebra, for example, one sees both theorems in the
Greek style and the desire for numerical solutions. In
his discussion of cubic equations Khayyam manages to
find solutions by means of geometric constructions but
laments his in ability to find numerical values.
   Slowly, however, the realm of “number” began to
grow. The Greeks might have insisted that 10 was not
a number, but rather a name for a line segment, the
side of a square whose area is 10, or a name for a ratio.     order to be used, they needed to be tabulated, and the
Among the medieval mathematicians, both in Islam and

in Europe, 10 started to behave more and more like a
number, entering into operations and even appearing
as the solution of certain problems.
     5   Giving Equal Status to All Numbers
The idea of extending the decimal place-value system
to include fractions was discovered by several mathe-

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics
maticians independently. The most influential of these
was stevin [VI.10](/part-06/simon-stevin-15481620), a Flemish mathematician and engi-
neer who popularized the system in a book let called
1585. By extending place value to tenths, hundredths,
and so on, Stevin created the system we still use today.
More importantly, he explained how it simplified cal-
culations that involved fractions, and gave many prac-
tical applications. The cover page, in fact, announces
that the book is for “astrologers, surveyors, measurers
of tapestries.”
Stevin was certainly aware of some of the issues cre-
ated by his move. He knew, for example, that the dec-
imal expansion for 13 was infinitely long; his discus-
sion simply says that while it might be more correct
to say that the full infinite expansion was the correct
representation, in practice it made little difference if
we truncated it.
Stevin was also aware that his system provided a way
to attach a “number” (meaning a decimal expansion)
. qrt{1}.1764705882 (the beginning of the decimal expansion
20
of 17 ) and 1.4142135623 (the beginning of the decimal
√
expansion of 2). In his Arithmetic he boldly declared
powers, etc., and that roots were just numbers. He also
says that “there are no absurd, irrational, irregular,
inexplicable, or surd numbers.” Those were all terms
fractions.
What Stevin was proposing, then, was to flatten the
incredible diversity of “quantities” or “magnitudes”
into one expansive notion of number, defined by dec-
imal expansions. He was aware that these numbers
could be represented as lengths along a line. This
amounted to a fairly clear notion of what we now call
the positive real numbers.
Stevin’s proposal was made immensely more influ-
√
ential by the invention of logarithms. Like the sine and
the cosine, these were practical computational tools. In
tables were given in decimal form. Very soon, every one
√
was using decimal representation.
It was only much later that it came to be understood
what a bold leap this move represented. The positive
real numbers are not just a larger number system; they
are an immensely larger number system, whose inter-
nal complexity we still do not fully understand (see set
theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory)).

II.1.   From Numbers to Number Systems

Even as Stevin was writing, the next steps were being
taken: under the pressure of the theory of equations,
negative numbers and complex numbers began to be
useful. Stevin himself was already aware of negative
numbers, though he was clearly not quite comfortable
with them. For example, he explained that the fact that
−3 is a root of x 2 + x − 6 really means that 3 is a root
of the associated polynomial x 2 − x − 6, obtained by
replacing x by −x every where.
   This was an easy dodge, but cubic equations cre-
ated more difficult problems. The work of several Ital-
ian mathematicians of the sixteenth century led to a
method for solving cubic equations. As a crucial step,
this method involved extracting a square root. The
problem was that the number whose root was needed
some times came out negative.
   Up until then, it had always turned out that when an
algebraic problem led to the extraction of the square
root of a negative number, the problem simply had no
solution. But the equation x 3 = 15 x + 4 clearly did
have a solution—indeed, x = 4 is one—it was just that
applying the cubic formula required computing −121.
   It was bombelli [VI.8](/part-06/rafael-bombelli-1526after), also a mathematician and
engineer, who decided to bite the bullet and just see
what happened. In his Algebra, published in 1572, he
went ahead and computed with this “new kind of rad-
ical” and showed that he could find the solution of
the cubic in this way. This showed that the cubic for-
mula did indeed work in this case; more importantly,
it showed that these strange new numbers could be
useful.
   It took a while for people to become comfortable with
these new quantities. About fifty years later, we find
both Albert Girard and descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) saying that
equations can have three sorts of roots: true (mean-
ing positive), false (negative), and imaginary. It is not   existence of transcendental numbers was not known at
completely clear that they understood that these imag-
inary roots would be what we now call complex num-
bers; Descartes, at least, some times seems to be saying     both e and π were transcendental, and later in the cen-
that an equation of degree n must have n roots, and
that the ones that are neither “true” nor “false” must
simply be imagined.
   Slowly, however, complex numbers began to be used.
They came up in the theory of equations, in debates
about the logarithms of negative numbers, and in con-
nection to trigonometry. Their connection with the sine     covery, in 1843, of a completely new number system.
and cosine functions (via the exponential) was turned
into a powerful tool by euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) in the eighteenth     using complex numbers (rather than simply using pairs

81

well-known that every polynomial had a complete set
of roots in the complex numbers. This result became
known as the fundamental theorem of algebra
[V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra); it was finally proved to every one’s satisfaction
by gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855). Thus, the theory of equations did not
seem to require any further extension of the notion of
number.
7   Number Systems, Old and New
Since complex numbers are clearly different from real
numbers, their presence stimulated people to begin
classifying numbers into different kinds. Stevin’s egal-
itarianism had its impact, but it could not quite erase
the fact that whole numbers are nicer than decimals,
and that fractions are generally easier to grasp than
irrational numbers.
In the nineteenth century, all sorts of new ideas cre-
ated the need for a more careful look at this classifi-
cation. In number theory, Gauss and kummer [VI.40]
started looking at subsets of the complex numbers that
behaved in a way analogous to the integers, such as the
√set of all numbers a + b −1 with a and b both integers.
In the theory of equations, galois [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832) pointed out
that in order to do a careful analysis of the solvability of
an equation one must start by agreeing on what num-
bers count as “rational.” So, for example, he pointed out
that in abel’s [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829) theorem on the unsolvability of
the quintic, “rational” meant “expressible as a quotient
of polynomials in the symbols used as the coefficients
of the equation,” and he noted that the set of all such
expressions obeyed the usual rules of arithmetic.
In the eighteenth century, Johann Lambert had estab-
lished that e and π were irrational, and conjectured
that in fact they were transcendental, that is, that they
were not roots of any polynomial equation. Even the
the time; liouville [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) proved that such numbers
exist in 1844. Within a few decades, it was proved that
tury cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) showed that in fact the vast major-
ity of real numbers were transcendental. Cantor’s dis-
covery highlighted, for the first time, that the system
Stevin had popularized contained unexpected depths.
Perhaps the most important change in the concept of
number, however, came after hamilton’s [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) dis-
Hamilton had noticed that coordinatizing the plane

82

of real numbers) vastly simplified plane geometry. He
set out to find a similar way to parametrize three-
dimensional space. This turned out to be impossible,
but led Hamilton to a four -dimensional system, which
he called the quaternions [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena). These behaved
much like numbers, with one crucial difference: mul-
tiplication was not commutative, that is, if q and q are     theory of fields.
quaternions, qq and q q are usually not the same.
   The quaternions were the first system of “hyper-
complex numbers,” and their appearance generated
lots of new questions. Were there other such systems?
What counts as a number system? If certain “numbers”
can fail to satisfy the commutative law, can we make
numbers that break other rules?
   In the long run, this intellectual ferment led math-
ematicians to let go of the vague notion of “number”
or “quantity” and to hold on, instead, to the more for-
mal notion of an algebraic structure. Each of the num-
ber systems, in the end, is simply a set of entities on
which we can do operations. What makes them inter-
esting is that we can use them to parametrize, or coor-
dinatize, systems that interest us. The whole numbers
(or integers, to give them their latinized formal name),     ematical notions. In fact, even stranger systems can
for example, formalize the notion of counting, while
the real numbers parametrize the line and serve as the
basis for geometry.
   By the beginning of the twentieth century, there were     requisite system turns out not to exist yet, well, one
many well-known number systems. The integers had
pride of place, followed by a nested hierarchy con-
sisting of the rational numbers (i.e., the fractions), the   Further Reading
real numbers (Stevin’s decimals, now carefully formal-
ized), and the complex numbers. Still more general
than the complex numbers were the quaternions. But
these were by no means the only systems around.
Number theorists worked with several different fields
of algebraic numbers, subsets of the complex num-
bers that could be understood as autonomous sys-
tems. Galois had introduced finite systems that obeyed
the usual rules of arithmetic, which we now call finite
fields. Function theorists worked with fields of func-
tions; they certainly did not think of these as numbers,
but their analogy to number systems was known and
exploited.
   Early in the twentieth century, Kurt Hensel intro-
duced the p-adic numbers [III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory), which were built
from the rational numbers by giving a special role to a
prime number p. (Since p can be chosen at will, Hensel
in fact created infinitely many new number systems.)
These too “obeyed the usual rules of arithmetic,” in
the sense that addition and multiplication behaved as

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics
expected; in modern language, they were fields. The
p-adics provided the first system of things that were
recognizably numbers but that had no visible relation
to the real or complex numbers—apart from the fact
that both systems contained the rational numbers. As
a result, they led Ernst Steinitz to create an abstract
The move to abstraction that appears in Steinitz’s
work had also occurred in other parts of mathemat-
ics, most notably the theory of groups and their repre-
sentations and the theory of algebraic numbers. All of
these theories were brought together into conceptual
unity by noether [VI.76](/part-06/emmy-noether-18821935), whose program came to be
known as “abstract algebra.” This left numbers behind
completely, focusing instead on the abstract structure
of sets with operations.
Today, it is no longer that easy to decide what counts
as a “number.” The objects from the original sequence
of “integer, rational, real, and complex” are certainly
numbers, but so are the p-adics. The quaternions are
rarely referred to as “numbers,” on the other hand,
though they can be used to coordinatize certain math-
show up as coordinates, such as Cayley’s octonions
[III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena). In the end, whatever serves to parametrize or
coordinatize the problem at hand is what we use. If the
just has to invent it.
