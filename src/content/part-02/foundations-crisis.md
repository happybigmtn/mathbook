# The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

$142$

in 1976 Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken settled a famous old problem by proving the four-color theorem [V.12](/part-05/the-four-color-theorem) . Their proof involved the checking of a huge number of different map configurations, which they did with the help of a computer. Initially, this raised debates about the legitimacy of their proof but it quickly became accepted and there are now several proofs of this kind. Some mathematicians even believe that computer-assisted and, more importantly, computer-generated proofs are the future of the entire discipline.
Under this (currently minority) view, our present views about what counts as an acceptable mathematical proof will soon become obsolete. A last point to stress is that many branches of mathematics now contain conjectures that seem to be both fundamentally important and out of reach for the foreseeable future. Mathematicians persuaded of the truth of such conjectures increasingly under take the systematic study of their consequences, assuming that an acceptable proof will one day appear (or at least that the conjecture is true).
Such conditional results are published in leading mathematical journals and doctoral degrees are routinely awarded for them. These trends all raise interesting questions about existing conceptions of legitimate mathematical proofs, the status of truth in mathematics, and the relationship between “pure” and “applied” fields. The formal notion of a proof as a string of symbols that obeys certain syntactical rules continues to provide an ideal model for the principles that under lie what most mathematicians see as the essence of their discipline.
It allows far-reaching mathematical analysis of the power of certain axiomatic systems, but at the same time it falls short of explaining the changing ways in which mathematicians decide what kinds of arguments they are willing to accept as legitimate in their actual professional practice.

The foundational crisis is a celebrated affair among mathematicians and it has also reached a large nonmathematical audience. A well-trained mathematician is supposed to know something about the three viewpoints called “logicism,” “formalism,” and “intuitionism” (to be explained below), and about what gödel’s incompleteness results [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem) tell us about the status of mathematical knowledge.
Professional mathematicians tend to be rather opinionated about such topics, either dismissing the foundational discussion as irrelevant--and thus siding with the winning party-- or defending, either as a matter of principle or as an intriguing option, some form of revisionist approach to mathematics. But the real out lines of the historical debate are not well-known and the subtler philosophical issues at stake are often ignored. Here we shall mainly discuss the former, in the hope that this will help bring the main conceptual issues into sharper focus.
The foundational crisis is usually understood as a relatively localized event in the $1920s$ , a heated debate between the partisans of “classical” (meaning late-nineteenth century) mathematics, led by hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and their critics, led by brouwer [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966), who advocated strong revision of the received doctrines.
There is, however, a second, and in my opinion very important, sense in which the “crisis” was a long and global process, in distinguishable from the rise of modern mathematics and the philosophical and methodological issues it created. This is the standpoint from which the present account has been written. Within this longer process one can still pick out some noteworthy intervals. Around 1870 there were many discussions about the acceptability of non-Euclidean geometries, and also about the proper foundations of complex analysis and even the real numbers.
Early in the twentieth century there were debates about set theory, about the concept of the continuum, and about the role of logic and the axiomatic method versus

II.7.   The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

the role of intuition. By about 1925 there was a cri-
sis in the proper sense, during which the main opin-
ions in these debates were developed and turned into
detailed mathematical research projects. And in the
1930 s gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness results,
which could not be assimilated with out some cherished
beliefs being abandoned. Let us analyze some of these
events and issues in greater detail.

There is evidence that in 1899 Hilbert endorsed the
viewpoint that came to be known as logicism. Logicism
was the thesis that the basic concepts of mathemat-
ics are definable by means of logical notions, and that
the key principles of mathematics are deducible from
logical principles alone.
  Over time this thesis has become unclear, based as it
seems to be on a fuzzy and immature conception of the
scope of logical theory. But historically speaking logi-
cism was a neat intellectual reaction to the rise of mod-
ern mathematics, and particularly to the set-theoretic
approach and methods. Since the majority opinion was
that set theory is just a part of (refined) logic,1 this the-
sis was thought to be supported by the fact that the
theories of natural and real numbers can be derived
from set theory, and also by the increasingly important
role of set-theoretic methods in algebra and in real and
complex analysis.
  Hilbert was following dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) in the way
he understood mathematics. For us, the essence of
Hilbert’s and Dedekind’s early logicism is their self-
conscious endorsement of certain modern methods,
however daring they seemed at the time. These meth-
ods had emerged gradually during the nineteenth cen-
tury, and were particularly associated with Göttingen
mathematics (gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and dirichlet [VI.36]);
they experienced a crucial turning point with rie-
mann’s [VI.49] novel ideas, and were developed fur-
ther by Dedekind, cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), Hilbert, and other,
lesser figures. Meanwhile, the influential Berlin school
of mathematics had opposed this new trend, kro-
necker [VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891) head-on and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) more
subtly. (The name of Weierstrass is synonymous with
the introduction of rigor in real analysis, but in fact, as
will be indicated below, he did not favor the more mod-
ern methods elaborated in his time.) Mathematicians in
  1. One should mention that key figures like Riemann and Cantor
disagreed (see Ferreirós 1999). The “majority” included Dedekind,
peano [VI.62](/part-06/giuseppe-peano-18581932), Hilbert, russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), and others.

Paris and elsewhere also harbored doubts about these
new and radical ideas.
The most characteristic traits of the modern ap-
proach were:
(i) acceptance of the notion of an “arbitrary” function
proposed by Dirichlet;
(ii) a wholehearted acceptance of infinite sets and the
higher infinite;
1   Early Foundational Questions
calculations” (Dirichlet), and to concentrate on
“structures” characterized axiomatically; and
(iv) a frequent reliance on “purely existential” meth-
ods of proof.
An early and influential example of these traits was
Dedekind’s approach (1871) to algebraic number
theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)—his set-theoretic definition of number
fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields) and ideals [III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules), and the methods
by which he proved results such as the fund a men-
tal theorem of unique decomposition. In a remark-
able departure from the number-theoretic tradition,
Dedekind studied the factorization properties of alge-
braic integers in terms of ideals, which are certain infi-
nite sets of algebraic integers. Using this new abstract
concept, together with a suitable definition of the
product of two ideals, Dedekind was able to prove in
full generality that, within any ring of algebraic inte-
gers, ideals possess a unique decomposition into prime
ideals.
The influential algebraist Kronecker complained that
Dedekind’s proofs do not enable us to calculate, in
a particular case, the relevant divisors or ideals: that
is, the proof was purely existential. Kronecker’s view
was that this abstract way of working, made possible
by the set-theoretic methods and by a concentration
on the algebraic properties of the structures involved,
was too remote from an algorithmic treatment—that is,
from so-called constructive methods. But for Dedekind
this complaint was misguided: it merely showed that
he had succeeded in elaborating the principle “to put
thoughts in the place of calculations,” a principle that
was also emphasized in Riemann’s theory of complex
functions. Obviously, concrete problems would require
the development of more delicate computational tech-
niques, and Dedekind contributed to this in several
papers. But he also insisted on the importance of a
general, conceptual theory.
The ideas and methods of Riemann and Dedekind
became better known through publications of the pe-
riod 1867–72. These were found particularly shocking

$144$

because of their very explicit defense of the view that mathematical theories ought not to be based upon formulas and calculations--they should always be based on clearly formulated general concepts, with analytical expressions or calculating devices relegated to the further development of the theory. To explain the contrast, let us consider the particularly clear case of the opposition between the different approaches of Riemann and Weierstrass to function theory.
Weierstrass explicitly represented analytic (or holomorphic [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) ) functions as collections $\infty$ of power series of the form {}n = {}0 an(z - a)n , which were connected with each other by analytic continuation [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) . Riemann chose a very different and more abstract approach, defining a function to be analytic if it satisfies the cauchy-riemann different i ability conditions [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).
2 This neat conceptual definition appeared objectionable to Weierstrass, as the class of differentiable functions had never been carefully characterized (in terms of series representations, for example). Exercising his famous critical abilities, Weierstrass offered examples of continuous functions that were no where differentiable. It is worth mentioning that, in preferring infinite series as the key means for research in analysis and function theory, Weierstrass remained closer to the old eighteenth-century idea of a function as an analytical expression.
On the other hand, Riemann and Dedekind were always in favor of Dirichlet’s abstract idea of a function f as an “arbitrary” way of associating with each x some $y = f$ (x) . (Previously it had been required that y should be expressed in terms of x by means of an explicit formula .) In his letters, Weierstrass criticized this conception of Dirichlet’s as too general and vague to constitute the starting point for any interesting mathematical development.
He seems to have missed the point that it was in fact just the right framework in which to define and analyze general concepts such as continuity [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and integration [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). This framework came to be called the conceptual approach in nineteenth-century mathematics. Similar methodological debates emerged in other areas too. In a letter of 1870 , Kronecker went as far as saying that the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem was $2$ .
Riemann determined particular functions by a series of independent traits such as the associated riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and the behavior at singular points. These traits determined the function via a certain variational principle (the “Dirichlet principle ”), which was also criticized by Weierstrass, who gave a counterexample to it. Hilbert and Kneser would later reformulate and justify the principle. II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics an “obvious sophism,” promising that he would offer counterexamples.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that an infinite bounded set of real numbers has an accumulation point, was a cornerstone of classical analysis, and was emphasized as such by Weierstrass in his famous Berlin lectures. The problem for Kronecker was that this theorem rests entirely on the completeness axiom for the real numbers (which , in one version, states that every sequence of nonempty nested closed intervals in R has a nonempty intersection). The real numbers cannot be constructed in an elementary way from the rational numbers:
one has to make heavy use of infinite sets (such as the set of all possible “Dedekind cuts,” which are subsets C ⊂ Q such that p $\in$ C whenever $p$ and $q$ are rational numbers such that p $<q$ and $q\in$ C). To put it another way: Kronecker was drawing attention to the problem that, very often, the accumulation point in the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem cannot be constructed by elementary operations from the rational numbers. The classical idea of the set of real numbers, or “the continuum,” already contained the seeds of the nonconstructive ingredient in modern mathematics.
Later on, in around 1890 , Hilbert’s work on invariant theory led to a debate about his purely existential proof of another basic result, the basis theorem, which states (in modern terminology) that every ideal in a polynomial ring is finitely generated. Paul Gordan, famous as the “king” of invariants for his heavily algorithmic work on the topic, remarked humorously that this was “theology,” not mathematics!
(He apparently meant that, because the proof was purely existential, rather than constructive, it was comparable with philosophical proofs of the existence of God .) This early foundational debate led to a gradual clarification of the opposing viewpoints. Cantor’s proofs in set theory also became quintessential examples of the modern methodology of existential proof. He offered an explicit defense of the higher infinite and modern methods in a paper of 1883 , which was peppered with hidden attacks on Kronecker’s views.
Kronecker in turn criticized Dedekind’s methods publicly in 1882 , spoke privately against Cantor, and in 1887 published an attempt to spell out his foundational views. Dedekind replied with a detailed set-theoretic (and “thus,” for him, logicistic) theory of the natural numbers in 1888 . The early round of criticism ended with an apparent victory for the modern camp, which enrolled new and powerful allies such as Hurwitz, minkowski [VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909), Hilbert, Volterra, Peano, and hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), and

II.7.   The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

which was defended by influential figures such as klein
[VI.57]. Although Riemannian function theory was still
in need of further refinement, recent developments
in real analysis, number theory, and other fields were
showing the power and promise of the modern meth-
ods. During the 1890 s, the modern viewpoint in gen-
eral, and logicism in particular, enjoyed great expan-
sion. Hilbert developed the new methodology into the
axiomatic method, which he used to good effect in his
treatment of geometry (1899 and subsequent editions)
and of the real number system.
   Then, dramatically, came the so-called logical para-
doxes, discovered by Cantor, Russell, Zermelo, and oth-
ers, which will be discussed below. These were of two
kinds. On the one hand, there were arguments show-
ing that assumptions that certain sets exist lead to
contradictions. These were later called the set-theoretic    tary contradiction, now known as Russell’s paradox or
paradoxes. On the other, there were arguments, later
known as the semantic paradoxes, which showed up
difficulties with the notions of truth and definability.
These paradoxes completely destroyed the attractive
view of recent developments in mathematics that had
been proposed by logicism. Indeed, the heyday of logi-
cism came before the paradoxes, that is, before 1900;
it subsequently enjoyed a revival with Russell and his
“theory of types,” but by 1920 logicism was of inter-
est more to philosophers than to mathematicians. How-
ever, the divide between advocates of the modern meth-
ods and constructivist critics of these methods was
there to stay.

Hilbert opened his famous list of mathematical prob-
lems at the Paris International Congress of Mathematics
of 1900 with Cantor’s continuum problem [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory),
a key question in set theory, and with the problem
of whether every set can be well-ordered. His second
problem amounted to establishing the consistency of
the notion of the set R of real numbers. It was not by
chance that he began with these problems: rather, it
was a way of making a clear statement about how math-
ematics should be in the twentieth century. Those two
problems, and the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) employed
by Hilbert’s young colleague Zermelo to show that R
(the continuum) can be well-ordered, are quintessential
examples of the traits (i)–(iv) that were listed above. It   erty x ∉ x (bearing in mind that negation and mem-
is little wonder that less daring minds objected and
revived Kronecker’s doubts, as can be seen in many
publications of 1905–6. This brings us to the next stage     the set R = {x : x ∉ x}, but this leads quickly to a
of the debate.

145
2.1   Paradoxes and Consistency
In a remarkable turn of events, the champions of mod-
ern mathematics stumbled upon arguments that cast
new doubts on its cogency. In around 1896, Cantor dis-
covered that the seemingly harmless concepts of the
set of all ordinals and the set of all cardinals led to
contradictions. In the former case the contradiction
is usually called the Burali-Forti paradox; the latter is
the Cantor paradox. The assumption that all transfi-
nite ordinals form a set leads, by Cantor’s previous
results, to the result that there is an ordinal that is less
than itself—and similarly for cardinals. Upon learning
of these paradoxes, Dedekind began to doubt whether
human thought is completely rational. Even worse, in
1901–2 Zermelo and Russell discovered a very elemen-
some times as the Zermelo–Russell paradox, which will
be discussed in a moment. The untenability of the
previous understanding of set theory as logic became
clear, and there began a new period of instability. But
it should be said that only logicists were seriously
upset by these arguments: they were presented with
contradictions in their theories.
Let us explain the importance of the Zermelo–Russell
paradox. From Riemann to Hilbert, many authors ac-
cepted the principle that, given any well-defined logi-
cal or mathematical property, there exists a set of all
objects satisfying that property. In symbols: given a
well-defined property p, there exists another object,
the set {x : p(x)}. For example, corresponding to the
2   Around 1900
formally by Hilbert’s axioms) there is the set of all real
numbers; corresponding to the property of “being an
ordinal” there is the set of all ordinals; and so on. This
is called the comprehension principle, and it constitutes
the basis for the logicistic understanding of set theory,
often called naive set theory, although its naivete is
only clear with hindsight. The principle was thought
of as a basic logical law, so that all of set theory was
merely a part of elementary logic.
The Zermelo–Russell paradox shows that the com-
prehension principle is contradictory, and it does so
by formulating a property that seems to be as basic
and purely logical as possible. Let p(x) be the prop-
ber ship were assumed to be purely logical concepts).
The comprehension principle yields the existence of
contradiction: if R ∈ R, then R ∉ R (by the definition

146

of R), and similarly, if R ∉ R, then R ∈ R. Hilbert (like   it introduces an element by reference to a totality that
his older colleague frege [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925)) was led to abandon
logicism, and even wondered whether Kronecker might
have been right all along. Eventually he concluded that     numbers as the intersection of all sets that contain
set theory had shown the need to refine logical theory.
It was also necessary to establish set theory axiom at-
ically, as a basic mathematical theory based on math-
ematical (not logical) axioms, and Zermelo under took
this task.
   Hilbert famously advocated that to claim that a set of   N itself. This kind of procedure appeared unacceptable
mathematical objects exists is tantamount to proving
that the corresponding axiom system is consistent—
that is, free of contradictions. The documentary evi-
dence suggests that Hilbert came to this celebrated
principle in reaction to Cantor’s paradoxes. His rea-
soning may have been that, instead of jumping directly
from well-defined concepts to their corresponding sets,
one had first to prove that the concepts are logically
consistent. For example, before one could accept the set    nent). One begins with the idea of definable real num-
of all real numbers, one should prove the consistency
of Hilbert’s axiom system for them. Hilbert’s principle     language by finite expressions, there are only count-
was a way of removing any metaphysical content from
the notion of mathematical existence. This view, that
mathematical objects had a sort of “ideal existence” in     alphabetical order of their definitions. (This is known
the realm of thought rather than an independent meta-
physical existence, had been anticipated by Dedekind
and Cantor.
   The “logical” paradoxes included not only the ones
that go by the names of Burali-Forti, Cantor, and Rus-
sell, but also many semantic paradoxes formulated by
Russell, Richard, König, Grelling, etc. (Richard’s para-    digit of an . (For example, let the nth digit of r be 2
dox will be discussed below.) Much confusion emerged
from the abundance of different paradoxes, but one
thing is clear: they played an important role in promot-    of definable numbers. But in the course of this con-
ing the development of modern logic and convincing
mathematicians of the need for strictly formal presen-
tation of their theories. Only when a theory has been
stated within a precise formal language can one disre-
gard the semantic paradoxes, and even formulate the
distinction between these and the set-theoretic ones.
2.2   Predicativity
When the books of Frege and Russell made the para-
doxes of set theory widely known to the mathematical
community in 1903, poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) used them to put
forward criticisms of both logicism and formalism.
  His analysis of the paradoxes led him to coin an
important new notion, predicativity, and maintain that
impredicative definitions should be avoided in mathe-
matics. Informally, a definition is impredicative when

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics
already contains that element. A typical example is
the following: Dedekind defines the set N of natural
1 and are closed under an injective function σ such
that 1 ∉ σ (N). (The function σ is called the success or
function.) His idea was to characterize N as minimal,
but in his procedure the set N is first introduced by
appeal to a totality of sets that should already include
to Poincaré (and also to Russell), especially when the
relevant object can be specified only by reference to
the more embracing totality. Poincaré found examples
of impredicative procedures in each of the paradoxes
he studied.
Take, for instance, Richard’s paradox, which is one
of the linguistic or semantic paradoxes (where, as we
said, the notions of truth and definability are promi-
bers. Because definitions must be expressed in a certain
ably many definable numbers. Indeed, we can explic-
itly count the definable real numbers by listing them in
as the lexicographic order.) Richard’s idea was to apply
to this list a diagonal process, of the kind used by Can-
tor to prove that R is not countable [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets). Let the
definable numbers be a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . . Define a new num-
ber r in a systematic way, making sure that the nth
decimal digit of r is different from the nth decimal
unless the nth digit of an is 2, in which case let the
nth digit of r be 4.) Then r cannot belong to the set
struc tion, the number r has just been defined in finitely
many words! Poincaré would ban impredicative defini-
tions and would therefore prevent the introduction of
the number r , since it was defined with reference to the
totality of all definable numbers.3
In this kind of approach to the foundations of math-
ematics, all mathematical objects (beyond the natural
numbers) must be introduced by explicit definitions.
If a definition refers to a presumed totality of which
the object being defined is itself a member, we are
involved in a circle: the object itself is then a con-
stituent of its own definition. In this view, “definitions”
3. The modern solution is to establish mathematical definitions
within a well-determined formal theory, whose language and expres-
sions are fixed to begin with. Richard’s paradox takes advantage of an
ambiguity as to what the available means of definition are.

II.7.   The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

must be predicative: one refers only to totalities that
have already been established before the object one is
defining. Important authors such as Russell and weyl
[VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) accepted this point of view and developed it.
   Zermelo was not convinced, arguing that impredica-
tive definitions were often used unproblematical ly, not
only in set theory (as in Dedekind’s definition of N, for
example), but also in classical analysis. As a particular
example, he cited cauchy’s [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) proof of the fun-
da mental theorem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra),4 but a sim-
pler example of impredicative definition is the least
upper bound in real analysis. The real numbers are
not introduced separately, by explicit predicative defi-
ni tions of each one of them; rather, they are introduced
as a completed whole, and the particular way in which
the least upper bound of an infinite bounded set of
reals is singled out becomes impredicative. But Zermelo
insisted that these definitions are innocuous, because
the object being defined is not “created” by the defini-
tion; it is merely singled out (see his paper of 1908 in
van Heijenoort (1967, pp. 183–98)).
   Poincaré’s idea of abolishing impredicative defini-
tions became important for Russell, who incorporated
it as the “vicious circle principle” in his influential
theory of types. Type theory is a system of higher-order
logic, with quantification over properties or sets, over
relations, over sets of sets, and so on. Roughly speak-
ing, it is based on the idea that the elements of any
set should always be objects of a certain homogeneous
type. For instance, we can have sets of “individuals,”
such as {a, b}, or sets of sets of individuals, such as
{{a}, {a, b}}, but never a “mixed” set like {a, {a, b}}.
Russell’s version of type theory became rather compli-
cated because of the so-called ramification he adopted
in order to avoid impredicativity. This system, together
with axioms of infinity, choice, and “reducibility” (a
surprisingly ad hoc means to “collapse” the ramifica-
tion), sufficed for the development of set theory and the
number systems. Thus it became the logical basis for
the renowned Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and
Russell (1910–13), in which they carefully developed a
foundation for mathematics.
   Type theory remained the main logical system until
about 1930, but under the form of simple type theory
  4. Cauchy’s reasoning was clearly nonconstructive, or “purely exis-
tential” as we have been saying. In order to show that the polynomial   sets and their defining properties was at the time
must have one root, Cauchy studied the absolute value of the polyno-    deeply ingrained in the minds of mathematicians and
mial, which has a global minimum σ . This global minimum is impred-
icatively defined. Cauchy assumed that it was positive, and from this
he derived a contradiction.

147
(that is, with out ramification), which, as Chwistek, Ram-
sey, and others realized, suffices for a foundation in
the style of Principia. Ramsey proposed arguments that
were aimed at eliminating worries about impredicativ-
ity, and he tried to justify the other existence axioms
of Principia—the axiom of infinity and the axiom of
choice—as logical principles. But his arguments were
inconclusive. Russell’s attempt to rescue logicism from
the paradoxes remained unconvincing, except to some
philosophers (especially members of the Vienna Circle).
Poincaré’s suggestions also became a key principle
for the interesting foundational approach proposed by
Weyl in his book Das Kontinuum (1918). The main idea
was to accept the theory of the natural numbers as they
were conventionally developed using classical logic,
but to work predicatively from there on. Thus, unlike
Brouwer, Weyl accepted the principle of the excluded
middle. (This, and Brouwer’s views, will be discussed in
the next section.) However, the full system of the real
numbers was not available to him: in his system the set
R was not complete and the Bolzano–Weierstrass theo-
rem failed, which meant that he had to devise sophisti-
cated replacements for the usual derivations of results
in analysis.
The idea of predicative foundations for mathematics,
in the style of Weyl, has been carefully developed in
recent decades with noteworthy results (see Feferman
1998). Predicative systems lie between those that coun-
tenance all of the modern methodology and the more
stringent constructivist ic systems. This is one of sev-
eral foundational approaches that do not fit into the
conventional but by now outdated triad of logicism,
formalism, and intuitionism.
2.3   Choices
As important as the paradoxes were, their impact on
the foundational debate has often been over stated. One
frequently finds accounts that take the paradoxes as
the real starting point of the debate, in strong con-
trast with our discussion in section 1. But even if we
restrict our attention to the first decade of the twenti-
eth century, there was another controversy of equal,
if not greater, importance: the arguments that sur-
rounded the axiom of choice and Zermelo’s proof of
the well-ordering theorem.
Recall from section 2.1 that the association between
logicians (via the contradictory principle of com pre hen-
sion). The axiom of choice (AC) is the principle that,

$148$

given any infinite family of disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set, known as a choice set, that contains exactly one element from each set in the family. The problem with this, said the critics, is that it merely stipulates the existence of the choice set and does not give a defining property for it. Indeed, when it is possible to characterize the choice set explicitly, then the use of AC is avoidable! But in the case of Zermelo’s well-ordering theorem it is essential to employ AC.
The required well-ordering of R “exists” in the ideal sense of Cantor, Dedekind, and Hilbert, but it seemed clear that it was completely out of reach from any constructivist perspective. Thus, the axiom of choice exacerbated obscurities in previous conceptions of set theory, forcing mathematicians to introduce much-needed clarifications. On the one hand, AC was nothing but an explicit statement of previous views about arbitrary subsets, and yet, on the other, it obviously clashed with strongly held views about the need to explicitly define infinite sets by properties.
The stage was set for deep debate. The discussions about this particular topic contributed more than anything else to a clarification of the existential implications of modern mathematical methods. It is instructive to know that borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956), Baire, and lebesgue [VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941), who became critics, had all relied on AC in less obvious ways in order to prove theorems of analysis. Not by chance, the axiom was suggested to Zermelo by an analyst, Erhard Schmidt, who was a student of Hilbert.
$5$ After the publication of Zermelo’s proof, an intense debate developed through out Europe. Zermelo was spurred on to work out the foundations of set theory in an attempt to show that his proof could be developed within an unexceptionable axiom system. The out come was his famous axiom system [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory), a masterpiece that emerged from careful analysis of set theory as it was historically given in the contributions of Cantor and Dedekind and in Zermelo’s own theorem.
With some additions due to Fraenkel and von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957) (the axioms of replacement and regularity) and the major innovation proposed by Weyl and skolem [VI.81](/part-06/thoralf-skolem-18871963) (to formulate it within first-order logic [IV.23](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), i.e., quantifying over individuals, the sets, but not over their properties), the axiom system became in the $1920s$ the one that we now know. $5$ . One may still gain much insight by reading the letters exchanged by the French analysts in 1905( see Moore 1982 ;
Ewald 1996) and Zermelo’s clever arguments in his second 1908 proof of well-ordering (van Heijenoort 1967).

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

The ZFC system (this stands for “Zermelo-Fraenkel with choice ”) codifies the key traits of modern mathematical methodology, offering a satisfactory framework for the development of mathematical theories and the conduct of proofs. In particular, it includes strong existence principles, allows impredicative definitions and arbitrary functions, warrants purely existential proofs, and makes it possible to define the main mathematical structures. It thus exhibits all the tendencies (i) - (iv) mentioned in section $1$ .
Zermelo’s own work was completely in line with Hilbert’s in formal axiomatizations of about 1900 , and he did not forget to promise a proof of consistency. Axiomatic set theory, whether in the Zermelo-Fraenkel presentation or the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel version, is the system that most mathematicians regard as the working foundation for their discipline. As of 1910 , the contrast between Russell’s type theory and Zermelo’s set theory was strong.
The former system was developed within formal logic, and its point of departure (albeit later compromised for pragmatic reasons) was in line with predicativism; in order to derive mathematics, the system needed the existential assumptions of infinity and choice, but these were rhetorically treated as tentative hypotheses rather than out right axioms.
The latter system was presented informally, adopted the impredicative standpoint wholeheartedly, and asserted as axioms strong existential assumptions that were sufficient to derive all of classical mathematics and Cantor’s theory of the higher infinite. In the $1920s$ the separation diminished greatly, especially with respect to the first two traits just indicated. Zermelo’s system was perfected and formulated within the language of modern formal logic. And the Russellians adopted simple type theory, thus accepting the impredicative and “existential” methodology of modern mathematics.
This is often given the (potentially confusing) term “Platonism”: the objects that the theory refers to are treated as if they were independent of what the mathematician can actually and explicitly define. Meanwhile, back in the first decade of the twentieth century, a young mathematician in the Netherlands was beginning to find his way toward a philosophically colored version of constructivism. Brouwer presented his strikingly peculiar metaphysical and ethical views in 1905 , and started to elaborate a corresponding foundation for mathematics in his thesis of 1907 .
His philosophy of “intuitionism” derived from the old metaphysical view that individual consciousness is the one and

of little interest in itself, so we shall concentrate here   cal mathematics.)
on Brouwer’s constructivist ic principles. In the years
around 1910, Brouwer became a renowned mathemat i-
cian, with crucial contributions to topology such as his     dition al ways of reasoning about the natural numbers:

dational ideas, helping to create the famous “crisis,” to    this context with out hesitation. But Brouwer put for-
which we now turn. He was also successful in establish-
ing the customary (but misleading) distinction between
formalism and intuitionism.

In 1921, the Mathematische Zeitschrift published a
paper by Weyl in which the famous mathematician, who
was a disciple of Hilbert, openly espoused intuitionism
and diagnosed a “crisis in the foundations” of math-
ematics. The crisis pointed toward a “dissolution” of
the old state of analysis, by means of Brouwer’s “revo-
lution.” Weyl’s paper was meant as a propaganda pam-
phlet to rouse the sleepers, and it certainly did. Hilbert   the “Second Act” of intuitionism. The “First Act” (from
answered in the same year, accusing Brouwer and Weyl
of attempting a “putsch” aimed at establishing “dic-
tat or ship à la Kronecker” (see the relevant papers in
Mancosu (1998) and van Heijenoort (1967)). The foun-
dational debate shifted dramatically toward the battle
between Hilbert’s attempts to justify “classical” math-
ematics and Brouwer’s developing reconstruction of a
much-reformed intuitionistic mathematics.
   Why was Brouwer “revolutionary”? Up to 1920 the
key foundational issues had been the acceptability of
the real numbers and, more fundamentally, of the
impredicativity and strong existential assumptions of
set theory, which supported the higher infinite and
the unrestricted use of existential proofs. Set theory
and, by implication, classical analysis had been crit-
icized for their reliance on impredicative definitions
and for their strong existential assumptions (in par-
ticular, the axiom of choice, of which extensive use
was made by sierpiński [VI.77](/part-06/wacaw-sierpinski-18821969) in 1918). Thus, the
debate in the first two decades of the twentieth cen-
tury was mainly about which principles to accept
when it came to defining and establishing the exis-
tence of sets and subsets. A key question was, can
one make rigorous the vague idea behind talk of “arbi-
trary subsets”? The most coherent reactions had been
Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory and Weyl’s
predicative system in Das Kontinuum. (The Principia
Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell was an unsuc-

Brouwer, however, brought new and even more basic
questions to the fore. No one had questioned the tra-
classical logic, in particular the use of quantifiers and
ward principled critiques of these assumptions and
started developing an alternative theory of analysis
that was much more radical than Weyl’s. In doing so, he
came upon a new theory of the continuum, which finally

new age.
3.1   Intuitionism
Brouwer began systematically developing his views
with two papers on “intuitionistic set theory,” writ-
ten in German and published in 1918 and 1919 by
the Verhandelingen of the Dutch Academy of Sciences.
These contributions were part of what he regarded as
1907) had been his emphasis on the intuitive founda-
tions of mathematics. Already Klein and Poincaré had
insisted that intuition has an inescapable role to play
in mathematical knowledge: as important as logic is in
proofs and in the development of mathematical theory,
mathematics cannot be reduced to pure logic; theories
and proofs are of course organized logically, but their
basic principles (axioms) are grounded in intuition. But
Brouwer went beyond them and insisted on the abso-
lute independence of mathematics from language and
logic.
From 1907, Brouwer rejected the principle of the
excluded middle (PEM), which he regarded as equiva-
lent to Hilbert’s conviction that all mathematical prob-
lems are solvable. PEM is the logical principle that the
statement p ∨ ¬p (that is, either p or not p) must
always be true, whatever the proposition p may be.
(For example, it follows from PEM that either the deci-
mal expansion of π contains infinitely many sevens or
it contains only finitely many sevens, even though we
do not have a proof of which.) Brouwer held that our
customary logical principles were abstracted from the
way we dealt with subsets of a finite set, and that it
was wrong to apply them to infinite sets as well. After
World War I he started the systematic reconstruction
of mathematics.
The intuitionist position is that one can only state “p
or q” when one can give either a constructive proof of

150

p or a constructive proof of q. This standpoint has the
consequence that proofs by contradiction (reductio ad
absurdum) are not valid. Consider Hilbert’s first proof
of his basis theorem (section 1), achieved by reductio:
he showed that one can derive a contradiction from the
assumption that the basis is infinite, and from this he
concluded that the basis is finite. The logic behind this
procedure is that we start from a concrete instance of
PEM, p ∨ ¬p, show that ¬p is untenable, and conclude
that p must be true. But constructive mathematics asks
for explicit procedures for constructing each object that     later call “spreads” and “species.” A species is basically
is assumed to exist, and explicit constructions behind
any mathematical statement. Similarly, we have men-
tioned before (section 2.1) Cauchy’s proof of the fun-
da mental theorem of algebra, as well as many proofs in
real analysis that invoke the least upper bound. All of
these proofs are in valid for a constructivist, and sev-
eral mathematicians have tried to save the theorems
by finding constructivist proofs for them. For instance,
both Weyl and Kneser worked on constructivist proofs
for the fundamental theorem of algebra.
   It is easy to give instances of the use of PEM that a
constructivist will not accept: one just has to apply it
to any unsolved mathematical problem. For example,
Catalan’s constant is the number
It is not known whether K is transcendental, so if p is
the statement “Catalan’s constant is transcendental,”

then a constructivist will not accept that p is either true   (and the initial condition x1 = 2). But another is to
or false.
   This may seem odd, or even obviously wrong, until
one realizes that constructivists have a different view
about what truth is. For a constructivist, to say that a
proposition is true simply means that we can prove it
in accordance with the stringent methods that we are
discussing; to say that it is false means that we can
actually exhibit a counterexample to it. Since there is
no reason to suppose that every existence statement
has either a strict constructivist proof or an explicit
counterexample, there is no reason to believe PEM (with
this notion of truth). Thus, in order to establish the
existence of a natural number with a certain prop-
erty, a proof by reductio ad absurdum is not enough.
Existence must be shown by explicit determination or
construction if you want to persuade a constructivist.
   Notice also how this viewpoint implies that math-
ematics is not time less or ahistorical. It was only in
1882 that Lindemann proved that π is a transcenden-

tal number [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers). Since that date, it has been pos-
sible to assign a truth value to statements that were
neither true nor false before, according to intuition-
ists. This may seem paradoxical, but it was just right
for Brouwer, since in his view mathematical objects
are mental constructions and he rejected as “meta-
physics” the assumption that they have an independent
existence.
In 1918, Brouwer replaced the sets of Cantor and
Zermelo by constructive counterparts, which he would
a set that has been defined by a characteristic prop-
erty, but with the proviso that every element has been
previously and independently defined by an explicit
construction. In particular, the definition of any given
species will be strictly predicative.
The concept of a spread is particularly characteris-
tic of intuitionism, and it forms the basis for Brouwer’s
definition of the continuum. It is an attempt to avoid
idealization and do justice to the temporal nature
of mathematical constructions. Suppose, for example,
that we wish to define a sequence of rational num-
bers that gives better and better approximations to
the square root of 2. In classical analysis, one con-
ceives of such sequences as existing in their entirety,
. nfty

be produced. One way to produce them is to give a rule,
such as the recurrence relation xn+1 = (xn    2 + 2)/2 x
n
make less rigidly determined choices that obey certain
constraints: for instance, one might insist that xn has
denominator n and that xn     2 differs from 2 by at most
100/n, which does not determine xn uniquely but does
ensure that the sequence produces better and better
√
approximations to 2.
A choice sequence is therefore not required to be
completely specified from the outset, and it can involve
choices that are freely made by the mathematician at
different moments in time. Both these features make
choice sequences very different from the sequences
of classical analysis: it has been said that intuitionist
mathematics is “mathematics in the making.” By con-
trast, classical mathematics is marked by a kind of
time less objectivity, since its objects are assumed to
be fully determined in themselves and independent of
the thinking processes of mathematicians.
A spread has choice sequences as its elements—it is
something like a law that regulates how the sequences

II.7.   The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

are constructed.6 For instance, one could take a spread
that consisted of all choice sequences that began in
some particular way, and such a spread would repre-
sent a segment—in general, spreads do not represent
isolated elements, but continuous domains. By using
spreads whose elements satisfy the Cauchy condition,
Brouwer offered a new mathematical conception of the
continuum: rather than being made up of points (or real
numbers) with some previous Platonic existence, it was
more genuinely “continuous.” Interestingly, this view
is reminiscent of Aristotle, who, twenty-three centuries
earlier, had emphasized the priority of the continuum
and rejected the idea that an extended continuum can
be made up of unextended points.
   The next stage in Brouwer’s redevelopment of analy-
sis was to analyze the idea of a function. Brouwer
defined a function to be an assignment of values to the
elements of a spread. However, because of the nature of
spreads, this assignment had to be wholly dependent
on an initial segment of the choice sequence in order
to be constructively admissible. This threw up a big
surprise: all functions that are every where defined are
continuous (and even uniformly continuous). What, you
might wonder, about the function f where f (x) = 0
when x < 0 and f (x) = 1 when x ⩾ 0? For Brouwer,
this is not a well-defined function, and the underlying
reason for this is that one can determine spreads for
which we do not know (and may never know) whether
they are positive, zero, or negative. For instance, one
could let xn be 1 if all the even numbers between 4 and
2 n are sums of two primes, and −1 otherwise.
   The rejection of PEM has the effect that intuitionis-
tic negation differs in meaning from classical negation.
Thus, intuitionistic arithmetic is also different from
classical arithmetic. Nevertheless, in 1933 Gödel and
Gentzen were able to show that the dedekind–peano
axioms [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms) of arithmetic are consistent relative to
formalized intuitionistic arithmetic. (That is, they were
able to establish a correspondence between the sen-
tences of both formal systems, such that a con tr adic-
tion in classical arithmetic yields a contradiction in its
intuitionistic counterpart; thus, if the latter is consis-
tent, the former must be as well.) This was a small tri-
umph for the Hilbertians, though corresponding proofs
  6. More precisely, a spread is defined by means of two laws; see
Heyting (1956), or more recently van Atten (2003), for further details
on this and other points. One can picture a spread as a subtree of the
universal tree of natural numbers (consisting of all finite sequences of
natural numbers), together with an assignment of previously available
mathematical objects to the nodes. One law of the spread determines
nodes in the tree, the other maps them to objects.

151
for systems of analysis or set theory have never been
found.
Initially there had been hopes that the develop-
ment of intuitionism would end in a simple and ele-
gant presentation of pure mathematics. However, as
Brouwer’s reconstruction developed in the 1920 s, it
became more and more clear that intuitionistic analysis
was extremely complicated and foreign. Brouwer was
not worried, for, as he would say in 1933, “the spheres
of truth are less transparent than those of illusion.” But
Weyl, although convinced that Brouwer had delineated
the domain of mathematical intuition in a completely
satisfactory way, remarked in 1925: “the mathemat i-
cian watches with pain the largest part of his tower-
ing theories dissolve into mist before his eyes.” Weyl
seems to have abandoned intuitionism shortly there-
after. Fortunately, there was an alternative approach
that suggested another way of rehabilitating classical
mathematics.
3.2   Hilbert’s Program
This alternative approach was, of course, Hilbert’s pro-
gram, which promised, in the memorable phrasing of
1928, “to eliminate from the world once and for all the
skeptical doubts” as to the acceptability of the classical
theories of mathematics. The new perspective, which
he started to develop in 1904, relied heavily on formal
logic and a combinatorial study of the formulas that are
provable from given formulas (the axioms). With mod-
ern logic, proofs are turned into formal computations
that can be checked mechanically, so that the process
is purely constructivist ic.
In the light of our previous discussion (section 1),
it is interesting that the new project was to employ
Kroneckerian means for a justification of modern, anti-
Kroneckerian methodology. Hilbert’s aim was to show
that it is impossible to prove a contradictory formula
from the axioms. Once this had been shown combina-
tori ally or constructively (or, as Hilbert also said, fini-
tarily), the argument can be regarded as a justification
of the axiom system—even if we read the axioms as
talking about non-Kroneckerian objects like the real
numbers or transfinite sets.
Still, Hilbert’s ideas at the time were marred by a defi-
cient understanding of logical theory.7 It was only in
1917–18 that Hilbert returned to this topic, now with
7. The logic he presented in 1905 lagged far behind Frege’s system
of 1879 or Peano’s of the 1890 s. We do not enter into the development
of logical theory in this period (see, for example, Moore 1998).

152

a refined understanding of logical theory and a greater
awareness of the considerable technical difficulties of
his project. Other mathematicians played very signif-
icant parts in promoting this better understanding.
By 1921, helped by his assistant Bernays, Hilbert had
arrived at a very refined conception of the formaliza-
tion of mathematics, and had perceived the need for a
deeper and more careful probing into the logical struc-
ture of mathematical proofs and theories. His program
was first clearly formulated in a talk at Leipzig late in
1922.
   Here we will describe the mature form of Hilbert’s
program, as it was presented for instance in the 1925
paper “On the infinite” (see van Heijenoort 1967). The
main goal was to establish, by means of syntactic con-
sistency proofs, the logical acceptability of the princi-
ples and modes of inference of modern mathematics.
Axiomatics, logic, and formalization made it possible
to study mathematical theories from a purely mathe-
mat ical standpoint (hence the name metamathematics),
and Hilbert hoped to establish the consistency of the
theories by employing very weak means. In particular,
Hilbert hoped to answer all of the criticisms of Weyl
and Brouwer, and there by justify set theory, the clas-
sical theory of real numbers, classical analysis, and of
course classical logic with its PEM (the basis for in direct    that contain (primitive recursive) arithmetic, as Gödel
proofs by reductio ad absurdum).
   The whole point of Hilbert’s approach was to make
mathematical theories fully precise, so that it would
become possible to obtain precise results about their
properties. The following steps are indispensable for
the completion of such a program.
  (i) Finding suitable axioms and primitive concepts for

studied in any introduction to mathematical logic, such
as Dedekind–Peano arithmetic or Zermelo–Fraenkel set
theory. It turns out that first-order logic is enough for
codifying mathematical proofs, but, interestingly, this
realization came rather late—after gödel’s theorems
[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem).
Hilbert’s main insight was that, when theories are
formalized, any proof becomes a finite combinatorial
object: it is just an array of strings of symbols com-
plying with the formal rules of the system. As Bernays
said, this was like “projecting” the deductive structure
of a theory T into the number-theoretic domain, and it
became possible to express in this domain the consis-
tency of T . These realizations raised hopes that a fini-
tary study of formalized proofs would suffice to estab-
lish the consistency of the theory, that is, to prove the
sentence expressing the consistency of T . But this hope,
not warranted by the previous insights, turned out to
be wrong.8
Also, a crucial presupposition of the program was
that not only the logical calculus but also each of the
axiomatic systems would be complete. Roughly speak-
ing, this means that they would be sufficiently power-
ful to allow the derivation of all the relevant results.9
This assumption turned out to be wrong for systems
showed.
It remains to say a bit more about what Hilbert meant
by finitism (for details, see Tait 1981). This is one of
the points in which his program of the 1920 s adopted
to some extent the principles of intuitionists such as
Poincaré and Brouwer and deviated strongly from the
ideas Hilbert himself had considered in 1900. The key
idea is that, contrary to the views of logicists like

II.7.   The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

finitary consideration of signs that he took to be intu-
itively given. Finitary mathematics was not in need of
any further justification or reduction.
   Hilbert’s program proceeded gradually by studying
weak theories at first and proceeding to progressively
stronger ones. The metatheory of a formal system stud-
ies properties such as consistency, completeness, and
some others (“completeness” in the logical sense means
that all true or valid formulas that can be represented
in the calculus are formally deducible in it). Pro posi-
tional logic was quickly proved to be consistent and
complete. First-order logic, also known as predicate
logic, was proved complete by Gödel in his dissertation
of 1929. For all of the 1920 s, the attention of Hilbert
and coworkers was set on elementary arithmetic and its
subsystems; once this had been settled, the project was
to move on to the much more difficult, but crucial, cases
of the theory of real numbers and set theory. Acker-
mann and von Neumann were able to establish consis-
tency results for certain subsystems of arithmetic, but
between 1928 and 1930 Hilbert was convinced that the
consistency of arithmetic had already been established.
Then came the severe blow of Gödel’s incompleteness
results (see section 4).
   The name “formalism,” as a description of this pro-
gram, came from the fact that Hilbert’s method con-
sisted in formalizing each mathematical theory, and
formally studying its proof structure. However, this
name is rather one-sided and even confusing, espe-
cially because it is usually contrasted with intuition-
ism, a full-blown philosophy of mathematics. Like most
mathematicians, Hilbert never viewed mathematics as
a mere game played with formulas. Indeed, he often
emphasized the meaningfulness of (in formal) mathe-
mat ical statements and the depth of conceptual con-
tent expressed in them.10
3.3     Personal Disputes
The crisis was unfolding not just at an intellectual level
but also at a personal level. One should perhaps tell
this story as a tragedy, in which the personalities of
the main figures and the successive events made the
final result quite inescapable.
   Hilbert and Brouwer were very different personal i-
ties, though they were both extremely willful and clever
men. Brouwer’s worldview was idealistic and tended
to solipsism. He had an artistic temperament and an

  10. This is very explicit, for example, in the lectures of 1919–20
edited by Rowe (1992), and also in the 1930 paper that bears exactly    11. See his “Intuitionistic reflections on formalism” of 1928 (in
the same title (see Gesammelte Abhandlungen, volume 3).

153
eccentric private life. He despised the modern world,
looking to the inner life of the self as the only way
out (at least in principle, though not always in prac-
tice). He preferred to work in isolation, although he had
good friends in the mathematical community, espe-
cially in the international group of topologists that
gathered around him. Hilbert was typically modernist
in his views and attitudes; full of optimism and ratio-
nalism, he was ready to lead his university, his country,
and the international community into a new world. He
was very much in favor of collaboration, and felt happy
to join Klein’s schemes for institutional development
and power.
As a consequence of World War I, Germans in the
early 1920 s were not allowed to attend the Interna-
tional Congresses of Mathematicians. When the oppor-
tunity finally arose in 1928, Hilbert was eager to seize
on it, but Brouwer was furious because of restrictions
that were still imposed on the German delegation and
sent a circular letter in order to convince other math-
ematicians. Their viewpoints were widely known and
led to a clash between the two men. On another level,
Hilbert had made important concessions to his oppo-
nents in the 1920 s, hoping that he would succeed in
his project of finding a consistency proof. Brouwer
emphasized these concessions, accusing him of fail-
ing to recognize authorship, and demanded new con-
ces sions.11 Hilbert must have felt insulted and per-
haps even threatened by a man whom he regarded
as perhaps the greatest mathematician of the younger
generation.
The last straw came with an episode in 1928. Brouwer
had since 1915 been a member of the editorial board
of Mathematische Annalen, the most prestigious math-
ematics journal at the time, of which Hilbert had been
the main editor since 1902. Ill with “pernicious ane-
mia,” and apparently thinking that he was close to the
end, Hilbert feared for the future of his journal and
decided it was imperative to remove Brouwer from the
editorial board. When he wrote to other members of the
board explaining his scheme, which he was already car-
rying out, Einstein replied saying that his proposal was
unwise and that he wanted to have nothing to do with
it. Other members, however, did not wish to upset the
old and admired Hilbert. Finally, a dubious procedure
was adopted, where the whole board was dissolved and
created anew. Brouwer was greatly disturbed by this
Mancosu 1998).

154

action, and as a result of it the journal lost Einstein and
Carathéodory, who had previously been main editors
(see van Dalen 2005).
  After that, Brouwer ceased to publish for some years,
leaving some book plans unfinished. With his disap-
pearance from the scene, and with the gradual disap-
pearance of previous political turbulences, the feelings
of “crisis” began to fade away (see Hesseling 2003).
Hilbert did not intervene much in the subsequent
debates and foundational developments.

It was not only the Annalen war that Hilbert won: the
mathematical community as a whole continued to work
in the style of modern mathematics. And yet his pro-
gram suffered a profound blow with the publication
of Gödel’s famous 1931 article in the Monatshefte für
Mathematik und Physik. An extremely ingenious devel-
opment of met a mathematical methods—the arithme-
tization of metamathematics—allowed Gödel to prove
that systems like axiomatic set theory or Dedekind–
Peano arithmetic are incomplete (see gödel’s theorem
[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem)). That is, there exist propositions P formulated
strictly in the language of the system such that neither
P nor ¬P is formally provable in the system.
   This theorem already presented a deep problem for
Hilbert’s endeavor, as it shows that formal proof cannot
even capture arithmetical truth. But there was more.
A close look at Gödel’s arguments made it clear that
this first met a mathematical proof could itself be for-
malized, which led to “Gödel’s second theorem”—that
it is impossible to establish the consistency of the
systems mentioned above by any proof that can be
codified within them. Gödel’s arithmetization of meta-
mathematics makes it possible to build a sentence, in
the language of formal arithmetic, that expresses the
consistency of this same formal system. And this sen-
tence turns out to be among those that are unprov-
able.12 To express it contrapositively, a finitary formal
proof (codifiable in the system of formal arithmetic)
of the impossibility of proving 1 = 0 could be trans-
formed into a contradiction of the system! Thus, if
the system is indeed consistent (as most mathemat i-
cians are convinced it is), then there is no such fini-
tary proof.
  12. For further details, see, for example, Smullyan (2001), van Hei-   duces an open-ended set-theoretic universe, masterfully described by
jen oort (1967), and good introductions to mathematical logic. Both
theorems were carefully proved in Hilbert and Bernays (1934/39). Bad     papers in Bernacerraf and Putnam (1983).
expositions and faulty interpretations of Gödel’s results abound.

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics
According to what Gödel called at the time “the
von Neumann conjecture” (namely, that if there is a
finitary proof of consistency, then it can be formalized
and codified within elementary arithmetic), the second
theorem implies the failure of Hilbert’s program (see
Mancosu (1999, p. 38) and, for more on the reception,
Dawson (1997, pp. 68 ff)). One should emphasize that
Gödel’s negative results are purely constructivist ic and
even finitistic, valid for all parties in the foundational
debate. They were difficult to digest, but in the end
they led to a reestablishment of the basic terms for
4    Gödel and the Aftermath
Mathematical logic and foundational studies con-
tinued to develop brilliantly with Gentzen-style proof
theory, with the rise of model theory [IV.23](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), etc.—
all of which had their roots in the foundational stud-
ies of the first third of the twentieth century. Although
the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms suffice for giving a rig-
orous foundation to most of today’s mathematics,
and have a rather convincing intuitive justification in
terms of the “iterative” conception of sets,13 there is
a general feeling that foundational studies, instead
of achieving their ambitious goal, “found themselves
attracted into the whirl of mathematical activity, and
are now enjoying full voting rights in the mathematical
senate.”14
However, this impression is some what superficial.
Proof theory has developed, leading to noteworthy
reductions of classical theories to systems that can be
regarded as constructive. A striking example is that
analysis can be formalized in conservative extensions
of arithmetic: that is, in systems that extend the lan-
guage of arithmetic while including all theorems of
arithmetic, but which are “conservative” in the sense
that they have no new consequences in the language of
arithmetic. Some parts of analysis can even be devel-
oped in conservative extensions of primitive recursive
arithmetic (see Feferman 1998). This raises questions
about the philosophical bases on which the admissibil-
ity of the relevant constructive theories can be founded.
But for these systems the question is far less simple
than it was for Hilbert’s finitary mathematics; it seems
13. The basic idea is to view the set-theoretic universe as a product
of iterating the following operation: one starts with a basic domain
V0 (possibly finite or even equal to ∅) and forms all possible sets of
elements in the domain; this gives a new domain V1 , and one iterates
forming sets of V0 ∪ V1 , and so on (to infinity and beyond!). This pro-
Zermelo (1930). On the iterative conception, see, for example, the last
14. To use the words of Gian-Carlo Rota in an essay of 1973.

The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics fair to say that no general consensus has yet been reached. Whatever its roots and justification may be, mathematics is a human activity. This truism is clear from the subsequent development of our story. The mathematical community refused to abandon “classical” ideas and methods; the constructivist “revolution” was aborted. In spite of its failure, formalism established itself in practice as the avowed ideology of twentieth-century mathematicians.
Some have remarked that formalism was less a real faith than a Sunday refuge for those who spent their weekdays working on mathematical objects as something very real. The Platonism of working days was only abandoned, as a bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) member said, when a ready-made reply was needed to unwelcome philosophical questions concerning mathematical knowledge. One should note that formalism suited very well the needs of a self-conscious, autonomous community of research mathematicians.
It granted them full freedom to choose their topics and to employ modern methods to explore them. However, to reflective mathematical minds it has long been clear that it is not the answer. Epistemological questions about mathematical knowledge have not been “eliminated from the world”; philosophers, historians, cognitive scientists, and others keep looking for more adequate ways of understanding its content and development.
Need less to say, this does not threaten the autonomy of mathematical researchers--if autonomy is to be a concern, perhaps we should worry instead about the pressures exerted on us by the market and other powers. Both (semi -) constructivism and modern mathematics have continued to develop:
the contrast between them has simply been consolidated, though in a very unbalanced way, since some $99$ % of practicing mathematicians are “modern.” (But do statistics matter when it comes to the correct methods for mathematics ?) In 1905 , commenting on the French debate, hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) wrote that “there are two conceptions of mathematics, two mentalities, in evidence.” It has now come to be recognized that there is value in both approaches: they complement each other and can coexist peacefully.
In particular, interest in effective methods, algorithms, and computational mathematics has grown markedly in recent decades--and all of these are closer to the constructivist tradition. The foundational debate left a rich legacy of ideas and results, key insights and developments, including the formulation of axiomatic set theories and the rise

$155$

of intuitionism. One of the most important of these developments was the emergence of modern mathematical logic as a refinement of axiomatics, which led to the theories of recursion and computability in around 1936 ( see algorithms [II.4](/part-02/algorithms) ). In the process, our understanding of the characteristics, possibilities, and limitations of formal systems was hugely clarified. One of the hottest issues through out the whole debate, and probably its main source, was the question of how to understand the continuum.
The reader may recall the contrast between the set-theoretic understanding of the real numbers and Brouwer’s approach, which rejected the idea that the continuum is “built of” points. That this is a labyrinthine question was further established by results on Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH), which postulates that the cardinality of the set of real numbers is א 1 , the second transfinite cardinal, or equivalently that every infinite subset of R must biject with either N or with R itself.
Gödel proved in 1939 that CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory, but Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that it is independent of its axioms (i . e . , Cohen proved that the negation of CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory)). The problem is still alive, with a few mathematicians proposing alternative approaches to the continuum and others trying to find new and convincing set-theoretic principles that will settle Cantor’s question (see Woodin 2001 ).
The foundational debate has also contributed in a definitive way to clarifying the peculiar style and methodology of modern mathematics, especially the so-called Platonism or existential character of modern mathematics (see the classic 1935 paper of Bernays in Benacerraf and Putnam ( 1983 )), by which is meant (here at least) a methodological trait rather than any supposed implications of metaphysical existence. Modern mathematics investigates structures by considering their elements as given independently of human (or mechanical) capabilities of effective definition and construction.
This may seem surprising, but perhaps this trait can be explained by broader characteristics of scientific thought and the role played by mathematical structures in the modeling of scientific phenomena. In the end, the debate made it clear that mathematics and its modern methods are still surrounded by important philosophical problems. When a sizable amount of mathematical knowledge can be taken for granted, theorems can be established and problems can be solved with the certainty and clarity for which mathematics is celebrated. But when it comes to laying out the bare

beginnings, philosophical issues cannot be avoided.

also in the basic ideas behind Hilbert’s program, and
of course in the problem of the relationship between
formal mathematics and its in formal counterpart, a
problem that is brought into sharp focus by Gödel’s
theorems.
