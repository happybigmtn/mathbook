# The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics

$142$

in 1976 Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken settled a famous old problem by proving the four-color theorem [V.12](/part-05/the-four-color-theorem) . Their proof involved the checking of a huge number of different map configurations, which they did with the help of a computer. Initially, this raised debates about the legitimacy of their proof but it quickly became accepted and there are now several proofs of this kind. Some mathematicians even believe that computer-assisted and, more importantly, computer-generated proofs are the future of the entire discipline.
Under this (currently minority) view, our present views about what counts as an acceptable mathematical proof will soon become obsolete. A last point to stress is that many branches of mathematics now contain conjectures that seem to be both fundamentally important and out of reach for the foreseeable future. Mathematicians persuaded of the truth of such conjectures increasingly undertake the systematic study of their consequences, assuming that an acceptable proof will one day appear (or at least that the conjecture is true).
Such conditional results are published in leading mathematical journals and doctoral degrees are routinely awarded for them. These trends all raise interesting questions about existing conceptions of legitimate mathematical proofs, the status of truth in mathematics, and the relationship between “pure” and “applied” fields. The formal notion of a proof as a string of symbols that obeys certain syntactical rules continues to provide an ideal model for the principles that underlie what most mathematicians see as the essence of their discipline.
It allows far-reaching mathematical analysis of the power of certain axiomatic systems, but at the same time it falls short of explaining the changing ways in which mathematicians decide what kinds of arguments they are willing to accept as legitimate in their actual professional practice.

Mathematics

José Ferreirós

The foundational crisis is a celebrated affair among mathematicians and it has also reached a large nonmathematical audience. A well-trained mathematician is supposed to know something about the three viewpoints called “logicism,” “formalism,” and “intuitionism” (to be explained below), and about what gödel’s incompleteness results [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem) tell us about the status of mathematical knowledge.
Professional mathematicians tend to be rather opinionated about such topics, either dismissing the foundational discussion as irrelevant--and thus siding with the winning party-- or defending, either as a matter of principle or as an intriguing option, some form of revisionist approach to mathematics. But the real outlines of the historical debate are not well-known and the subtler philosophical issues at stake are often ignored. Here we shall mainly discuss the former, in the hope that this will help bring the main conceptual issues into sharper focus.
The foundational crisis is usually understood as a relatively localized event in the $1920s$ , a heated debate between the partisans of “classical” (meaning late-nineteenth century) mathematics, led by hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), and their critics, led by brouwer [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966), who advocated strong revision of the received doctrines.
There is, however, a second, and in my opinion very important, sense in which the “crisis” was a long and global process, in distinguishable from the rise of modern mathematics and the philosophical and methodological issues it created. This is the standpoint from which the present account has been written. Within this longer process one can still pick out some noteworthy intervals. Around 1870 there were many discussions about the acceptability of non-Euclidean geometries, and also about the proper foundations of complex analysis and even the real numbers.
Early in the twentieth century there were debates about set theory, about the concept of the continuum, and about the role of logic and the axiomatic method versus

because of their very explicit defense of the view that mathematical theories ought not to be based upon formulas and calculations--they should always be based on clearly formulated general concepts, with analytical expressions or calculating devices relegated to the further development of the theory. To explain the contrast, let us consider the particularly clear case of the opposition between the different approaches of Riemann and Weierstrass to function theory.
Weierstrass explicitly represented analytic (or holomorphic [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) ) functions as collections $\infty$ of power series of the form {}n = {}0 an(z - a)n , which were connected with each other by analytic continuation [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) . Riemann chose a very different and more abstract approach, defining a function to be analytic if it satisfies the cauchy-riemann different i ability conditions [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).
2 This neat conceptual definition appeared objectionable to Weierstrass, as the class of differentiable functions had never been carefully characterized (in terms of series representations, for example). Exercising his famous critical abilities, Weierstrass offered examples of continuous functions that were nowhere differentiable. It is worth mentioning that, in preferring infinite series as the key means for research in analysis and function theory, Weierstrass remained closer to the old eighteenth-century idea of a function as an analytical expression.
On the other hand, Riemann and Dedekind were always in favor of Dirichlet’s abstract idea of a function f as an “arbitrary” way of associating with each x some $y = f$ (x) . (Previously it had been required that y should be expressed in terms of x by means of an explicit formula .) In his letters, Weierstrass criticized this conception of Dirichlet’s as too general and vague to constitute the starting point for any interesting mathematical development.
He seems to have missed the point that it was in fact just the right framework in which to define and analyze general concepts such as continuity [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and integration [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). This framework came to be called the conceptual approach in nineteenth-century mathematics. Similar methodological debates emerged in other areas too. In a letter of 1870 , Kronecker went as far as saying that the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem was $2$ .
Riemann determined particular functions by a series of independent traits such as the associated riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) and the behavior at singular points. These traits determined the function via a certain variational principle (the “Dirichlet principle ”), which was also criticized by Weierstrass, who gave a counterexample to it. Hilbert and Kneser would later reformulate and justify the principle. II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics an “obvious sophism,” promising that he would offer counterexamples.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that an infinite bounded set of real numbers has an accumulation point, was a cornerstone of classical analysis, and was emphasized as such by Weierstrass in his famous Berlin lectures. The problem for Kronecker was that this theorem rests entirely on the completeness axiom for the real numbers (which , in one version, states that every sequence of nonempty nested closed intervals in R has a nonempty intersection). The real numbers cannot be constructed in an elementary way from the rational numbers:
one has to make heavy use of infinite sets (such as the set of all possible “Dedekind cuts,” which are subsets C ⊂ Q such that p $\in$ C whenever $p$ and $q$ are rational numbers such that p $<q$ and $q\in$ C). To put it another way: Kronecker was drawing attention to the problem that, very often, the accumulation point in the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem cannot be constructed by elementary operations from the rational numbers. The classical idea of the set of real numbers, or “the continuum,” already contained the seeds of the nonconstructive ingredient in modern mathematics.
Later on, in around 1890 , Hilbert’s work on invariant theory led to a debate about his purely existential proof of another basic result, the basis theorem, which states (in modern terminology) that every ideal in a polynomial ring is finitely generated. Paul Gordan, famous as the “king” of invariants for his heavily algorithmic work on the topic, remarked humorously that this was “theology,” not mathematics!
(He apparently meant that, because the proof was purely existential, rather than constructive, it was comparable with philosophical proofs of the existence of God .) This early foundational debate led to a gradual clarification of the opposing viewpoints. Cantor’s proofs in set theory also became quintessential examples of the modern methodology of existential proof. He offered an explicit defense of the higher infinite and modern methods in a paper of 1883 , which was peppered with hidden attacks on Kronecker’s views.
Kronecker in turn criticized Dedekind’s methods publicly in 1882 , spoke privately against Cantor, and in 1887 published an attempt to spell out his foundational views. Dedekind replied with a detailed set-theoretic (and “thus,” for him, logicistic) theory of the natural numbers in 1888 . The early round of criticism ended with an apparent victory for the modern camp, which enrolled new and powerful allies such as Hurwitz, minkowski [VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909), Hilbert, Volterra, Peano, and hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), and

given any infinite family of disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set, known as a choice set, that contains exactly one element from each set in the family. The problem with this, said the critics, is that it merely stipulates the existence of the choice set and does not give a defining property for it. Indeed, when it is possible to characterize the choice set explicitly, then the use of AC is avoidable! But in the case of Zermelo’s well-ordering theorem it is essential to employ AC.
The required well-ordering of R “exists” in the ideal sense of Cantor, Dedekind, and Hilbert, but it seemed clear that it was completely out of reach from any constructivist perspective. Thus, the axiom of choice exacerbated obscurities in previous conceptions of set theory, forcing mathematicians to introduce much-needed clarifications. On the one hand, AC was nothing but an explicit statement of previous views about arbitrary subsets, and yet, on the other, it obviously clashed with strongly held views about the need to explicitly define infinite sets by properties.
The stage was set for deep debate. The discussions about this particular topic contributed more than anything else to a clarification of the existential implications of modern mathematical methods. It is instructive to know that borel [VI.70](/part-06/emile-borel-18711956), Baire, and lebesgue [VI.72](/part-06/henri-lebesgue-18751941), who became critics, had all relied on AC in less obvious ways in order to prove theorems of analysis. Not by chance, the axiom was suggested to Zermelo by an analyst, Erhard Schmidt, who was a student of Hilbert.
$5$ After the publication of Zermelo’s proof, an intense debate developed through out Europe. Zermelo was spurred on to work out the foundations of set theory in an attempt to show that his proof could be developed within an unexceptionable axiom system. The outcome was his famous axiom system [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) , a masterpiece that emerged from careful analysis of set theory as it was historically given in the contributions of Cantor and Dedekind and in Zermelo’s own theorem.
With some additions due to Fraenkel and von neumann [VI.91](/part-06/john-von-neumann-19031957) (the axioms of replacement and regularity) and the major innovation proposed by Weyl and skolem [VI.81](/part-06/thoralf-skolem-18871963) (to formulate it within first-order logic [IV.23](/part-04/logic-and-model-theory), i.e., quantifying over individuals, the sets, but not over their properties), the axiom system became in the $1920s$ the one that we now know. $5$ . One may still gain much insight by reading the letters exchanged by the French analysts in 1905( see Moore 1982 ;
Ewald 1996) and Zermelo’s clever arguments in his second 1908 proof of well-ordering (van Heijenoort 1967).

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

The ZFC system (this stands for “Zermelo-Fraenkel with choice ”) codifies the key traits of modern mathematical methodology, offering a satisfactory framework for the development of mathematical theories and the conduct of proofs. In particular, it includes strong existence principles, allows impredicative definitions and arbitrary functions, warrants purely existential proofs, and makes it possible to define the main mathematical structures. It thus exhibits all the tendencies (i) - (iv) mentioned in section $1$ .
Zermelo’s own work was completely in line with Hilbert’s informal axiomatizations of about 1900 , and he did not forget to promise a proof of consistency. Axiomatic set theory, whether in the Zermelo-Fraenkel presentation or the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel version, is the system that most mathematicians regard as the working foundation for their discipline. As of 1910 , the contrast between Russell’s type theory and Zermelo’s set theory was strong.
The former system was developed within formal logic, and its point of departure (albeit later compromised for pragmatic reasons) was in line with predicativism; in order to derive mathematics, the system needed the existential assumptions of infinity and choice, but these were rhetorically treated as tentative hypotheses rather than outright axioms.
The latter system was presented informally, adopted the impredicative standpoint wholeheartedly, and asserted as axioms strong existential assumptions that were sufficient to derive all of classical mathematics and Cantor’s theory of the higher infinite. In the $1920s$ the separation diminished greatly, especially with respect to the first two traits just indicated. Zermelo’s system was perfected and formulated within the language of modern formal logic. And the Russellians adopted simple type theory, thus accepting the impredicative and “existential” methodology of modern mathematics.
This is often given the (potentially confusing) term “Platonism”: the objects that the theory refers to are treated as if they were independent of what the mathematician can actually and explicitly define. Meanwhile, back in the first decade of the twentieth century, a young mathematician in the Netherlands was beginning to find his way toward a philosophically colored version of constructivism. Brouwer presented his strikingly peculiar metaphysical and ethical views in 1905 , and started to elaborate a corresponding foundation for mathematics in his thesis of 1907 .
His philosophy of “intuitionism” derived from the old metaphysical view that individual consciousness is the one and

The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics fair to say that no general consensus has yet been reached. Whatever its roots and justification may be, mathematics is a human activity. This truism is clear from the subsequent development of our story. The mathematical community refused to abandon “classical” ideas and methods; the constructivist “revolution” was aborted. In spite of its failure, formalism established itself in practice as the avowed ideology of twentieth-century mathematicians.
Some have remarked that formalism was less a real faith than a Sunday refuge for those who spent their weekdays working on mathematical objects as something very real. The Platonism of working days was only abandoned, as a bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) member said, when a ready-made reply was needed to unwelcome philosophical questions concerning mathematical knowledge. One should note that formalism suited very well the needs of a self-conscious, autonomous community of research mathematicians.
It granted them full freedom to choose their topics and to employ modern methods to explore them. However, to reflective mathematical minds it has long been clear that it is not the answer. Epistemological questions about mathematical knowledge have not been “eliminated from the world”; philosophers, historians, cognitive scientists, and others keep looking for more adequate ways of understanding its content and development.
Needless to say, this does not threaten the autonomy of mathematical researchers--if autonomy is to be a concern, perhaps we should worry instead about the pressures exerted on us by the market and other powers. Both (semi -) constructivism and modern mathematics have continued to develop:
the contrast between them has simply been consolidated, though in a very unbalanced way, since some $99$ % of practicing mathematicians are “modern.” (But do statistics matter when it comes to the correct methods for mathematics ?) In 1905 , commenting on the French debate, hadamard [VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) wrote that “there are two conceptions of mathematics, two mentalities, in evidence.” It has now come to be recognized that there is value in both approaches: they complement each other and can coexist peacefully.
In particular, interest in effective methods, algorithms, and computational mathematics has grown markedly in recent decades--and all of these are closer to the constructivist tradition. The foundational debate left a rich legacy of ideas and results, key insights and developments, including the formulation of axiomatic set theories and the rise

$155$

of intuitionism. One of the most important of these developments was the emergence of modern mathematical logic as a refinement of axiomatics, which led to the theories of recursion and computability in around 1936 ( see algorithms [II.4](/part-02/algorithms) ). In the process, our understanding of the characteristics, possibilities, and limitations of formal systems was hugely clarified. One of the hottest issues through out the whole debate, and probably its main source, was the question of how to understand the continuum.
The reader may recall the contrast between the set-theoretic understanding of the real numbers and Brouwer’s approach, which rejected the idea that the continuum is “built of” points. That this is a labyrinthine question was further established by results on Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH), which postulates that the cardinality of the set of real numbers is א 1 , the second transfinite cardinal, or equivalently that every infinite subset of R must biject with either N or with R itself.
Gödel proved in 1939 that CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory, but Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that it is independent of its axioms (i . e . , Cohen proved that the negation of CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory)). The problem is still alive, with a few mathematicians proposing alternative approaches to the continuum and others trying to find new and convincing set-theoretic principles that will settle Cantor’s question (see Woodin 2001 ).
The foundational debate has also contributed in a definitive way to clarifying the peculiar style and methodology of modern mathematics, especially the so-called Platonism or existential character of modern mathematics (see the classic 1935 paper of Bernays in Benacerraf and Putnam ( 1983 )), by which is meant (here at least) a methodological trait rather than any supposed implications of metaphysical existence. Modern mathematics investigates structures by considering their elements as given independently of human (or mechanical) capabilities of effective definition and construction.
This may seem surprising, but perhaps this trait can be explained by broader characteristics of scientific thought and the role played by mathematical structures in the modeling of scientific phenomena. In the end, the debate made it clear that mathematics and its modern methods are still surrounded by important philosophical problems. When a sizable amount of mathematical knowledge can be taken for granted, theorems can be established and problems can be solved with the certainty and clarity for which mathematics is celebrated. But when it comes to laying out the bare
