The Development of the Idea of Proof

realized the ultimate goal of Leibniz to have a theory of infinitesimals which was part of the same structure as that of the reals. Despite stimulating a flurry of activity, and considerable acclaim from some quarters, Robinson’s approach has never been widely accepted as a working foundation for analysis.

$1$ Introduction and

Preliminary Considerations

In many respects the development of the idea of proof is coextensive with the development of mathematics as a whole. Looking back into the past, one might at first consider mathematics to be a body of scientific knowledge that deals with the properties of numbers, magnitudes, and figures, obtaining its justifications from proofs rather than, say, from experiments or inductive inferences. Such a character ization, however, is not without problems. For one thing, it immediately leaves out important chapters in the history

of civilization that are more naturally associated with mathematics than with any other intellectual activity. For example, the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures developed elaborate bodies of knowledge that would most naturally be described as belonging to arithmetic or geometry, even though nothing is found in them that comes close to the idea of proof as it was later practiced in mathematics at large. To the extent that any justification is given, say, in the thousands of mathematical procedures found on clay tablets written in cuneiform script, it is inductive or based on experience.
The tablets repetitively show--without additional explanation or attempts at general justifications--a given procedure to be followed whenever one is pursuing a certain type of result. Later on, in the context of Chinese, Japanese, Mayan, or Hindu cultures, one again finds important developments in fields naturally associated with mathematics.
The extent to which these cultures pursued the idea of mathematical proof--a question that is debated among historians to this day-- was undoubtedly not as great as it was in Greek tradition, and it certainly did not take the specific forms we typically associate with the latter. Should one nevertheless say that these are instances of mathematical knowledge, even though they are not justified on the basis of some kind of general, deductive proof? If so, then we cannot characterize mathematics as a body of knowledge that is backed up by proofs, as suggested above.
However, this litmus test certainly provides a useful criterion--one that we do not want to give up too easily--for distinguishing mathematics from other intellectual endeavors. Without totally ignoring these important questions, the present account focuses on a story that started, at some point in the past, usually taken to be before or around the fifth century b.c.e.
in Greece, with the realization that there was a distinctive body of claims, mainly associated with numbers and with diagrams, whose truth could be and needed to be vindicated in a very special way--namely, by means of a general, deductive argument, or “proof.” Exactly when and how this story began is unclear. Equally unclear are the direct historical sources of such a unique idea.
Since the emphasis on the use of logic and reason in constructing an argument was well-entrenched in other spheres of public life in ancient Greece--such as politics, rhetoric, and law--much earlier than the fifth century b.c.e., it is possible that it is in those domains that the origins of mathematical proof are to be found.

$II$ . $6$ .

The Development of the Idea of Proof

practiced by Cavalieri, Roberval, and Torricelli. This is well illustrated by Torricelli’$s_{1643}$ calculation of the volume of the infinite body created by rotating the hyperbola $xy = k^{2}$ around the y-axis, with values of x between $0$ and a (as we would describe it in modern terms). The essential idea of indivisibles is that areas are considered to be sums, or collections, of infinitely many line segments, and volumes are considered to be sums, or collections, of infinitely many areas.
In this example, Torricelli calculated the volume of revolution by considering it to be a sum of the curved surfaces of an infinite collection of cylinders successively inscribed within each other and having radii ranging from $0$ to a. In modern algebraic terms, the height of the inscribed cylinder with radius x is k ${}^{2}/$ x , so the area of its curved √ surface is 2. ix(k2/x) = \pi( 2 k)2 , $a$ constant value that is independent of x and equal to the area of a circle √ of radius $2k$ .
Thus, in Torricelli’s approach based on the geometry of indivisibles, the collection of all surfaces that, when taken together, comprise the infinite body can be equated to a collection of circles with area $2\pik^{2}$ , one for each $x$ between $0$ and  a, or equivalently to a cylinder of volume $2\pik^{2}a.$ The rules of Euclid-like geometric proof were completely contravened in proofs of this kind and this made them unacceptable in the eyes of many.
On the other hand, their fruitfulness was highly appealing, especially in cases like this one in which an infinite body was shown to have a finite volume, a result which Torricelli himself found extremely surprising. Both supporters and detractors alike, however, realized that techniques of this kind might lead to contradictions and inaccurate results. By the eighteenth century, with the accelerated development of the infinitesimal calculus and its associated techniques and concepts, techniques based on indivisibles had essentially disappeared.
The limits set by the classical paradigm of Euclidean geometric proof were then transgressed in a different direction by the all-embracing algebraization of geometry at the hands of Descartes. The fundamental step under taken by Descartes was to introduce unit lengths as a key element in the diagrams used in geometric proofs. The radical innovation implied by this step, allowing the hitherto nonexistent possibility of defining operations with line segments, was explicitly stressed by Descartes in La Géométrie in 1637 :
Just as arithmetic consists of only four or five operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication,

division, and the extraction of roots, which may be considered a kind of division, so in geometry, to find required lines it is merely necessary to add or subtract other lines; or else, taking one line, which I shall call the unit in order to relate it as closely as possible to numbers, and which can in general be chosen arbitrarily, and having given two other lines, to find a fourth line which shall be to one of the given lines as the other is to the unit (which is the same as multiplication);
or again, to find a fourth line which is to one of the given lines as the unit is to the other (which is equivalent to division); or, finally, to find one, two, or several mean proportionals between the unit and some other line (which is the same as extracting the square root, cube root, etc., of the given line). Thus, for instance, given two segments BD, BE, the division of their lengths is represented by BC in figure $6$ , in which AB represents the unit length.
Although the proof was Euclid-like in appearance (because of the diagram and the use of the theory of similar triangles), the introduction of the unit length and its use for defining the operations with segments set it radically apart and opened completely new horizons for geometric proofs. Not only had measurements of length been absent from Euclidean-style proofs thus far, but also, as a consequence of the very existence of these operations, the essential dimensionality traditionally associated with geometric theorems lost its significance.
Descartes used expressions such as a  -  b, $a/b$ , $a^{2}$ , $b^{3}$ , and their roots, but he stressed that they should all be understood as “only simple lines, which, however, I name squares, cubes, etc., so that I make use of the terms employed in algebra.” With the removal of dimensionality, the requirement of homogeneity also became unnecessary. Unlike his predecessors, who handled magnitudes only when they had a direct geometric significance, Descartes could not see any problem in forming an expression such as $a^{2}b^{2} - b$ and then extracting its cube root.
In order to do so, he said “we must consider the quantity $a^{2}b^{2}$ divided once by the unit, and the quantity b multiplied twice by the unit.” Sentences of this kind would be simply in com pre he ns i ble to Greek geometers, as well as to their Islamic and Renaissance followers.
This algebraization of geometry, and particularly the newly created possibility of proving geometric facts via algebraic procedures, was strongly related to the recent consolidation of the idea of an algebraic equation, seen as an autonomous mathematical entity, for which formal rules of manipulation were well-known and could be systematically applied. This idea reached

The Development of the Idea of Proof

synthetic arithmetization of any given type of geometry, and thus helped to clarify the logical structure of Euclidean geometry as a deductive system. It also clarified the relationship between Euclidean geometry and the various other kinds of known geometries--non Euclidean, projective, or non-Archimedean. This focus on logic implied, among other things, that diagrams should be relegated to a merely heuristic role. In fact, although diagrams still appear in many proofs in the Grundlagen, the entire purpose of the logical analysis is to avoid being misled by diagrams.
Proofs, and particularly geometric proofs, have thus become purely logical arguments, rather than arguments about diagrams. And at the same time, the essence and the role of the axioms from which the derivations in question start also underwent a dramatic change. Following Pasch’s lead, Hilbert introduced a new system of axioms for geometry that attempted to close the logical gaps inherent in earlier systems.
These axioms were of five kinds--axioms of incidence, of order, of congruence, of parallels, and of continuity-- each of which expressed a particular way in which spatial intuition manifests itself in our understanding. They were formulated for three fundamental kinds of object: points, lines, and planes. These remained undefined, and the system of axioms was meant to provide an implicit definition of them.
In other words, rather than defining points or lines at the outset and then postulating axioms that are assumed to be valid for them, a point and a line were not directly defined, except as entities that satisfy the axioms postulated by the system. Further, Hilbert demanded that the axioms in a system of this kind should be mutually independent, and introduced a method for checking that this demand is fulfilled; in order to do so, he constructed models of geometries that fail to satisfy a given axiom of the system but satisfy all the others.
Hilbert also required that the system be consistent, and that the consistency of geometry could be made to depend, in his system, on that of arithmetic. He initially assumed that proving the consistency of arithmetic would not present a major obstacle and it was a long time before he realized that this was not the case. Two additional requirements that Hilbert initially introduced for axiomatic systems were simplicity and completeness.
Simplicity meant, in essence, that an axiom should not contain more than “a single idea.” The demand that every axiom in a system be “simple,” however, was never clearly defined or systematically pursued in subsequent works of Hilbert or any of his successors. The last requirement, com-

$139$

pleteness, meant for Hilbert in 1900 that any adequate axiomatization of a mathematical domain should allow for a derivation of all the known theorems of the discipline in question. Hilbert claimed that his axioms would indeed yield all the known results of Euclidean geometry, but of course this was not a property that he could formally prove. In fact, since this property of “completeness” cannot be formally checked for any given axiomatic system, it did not become one of the standard requirements of an axiomatic system.
It is important to note that the concept of completeness used by Hilbert in 1900 is completely different from the currently accepted, model-theoretical one that appeared much later. The latter amounts to the requirement that in a given axiomatic system every true statement, be it known or unknown, should be provable. The use of undefined concepts and the concomitant conception of axioms as implicit definitions gave enormous impetus to the view of geometry as a purely logical system, such as Pieri had devised it, and eventually transformed the very idea of truth and proof in mathematics.
Hilbert claimed on various occasions--echoing an idea of Dedekind--that, in his system, “points, lines, and planes” could be substituted by “chairs, tables, and beer mugs,” without thereby affecting in any sense the logical structure of the theory. Moreover, in the light of discussions about set-theoretical paradoxes, Hilbert strongly emphasized the view that the logical consistency of a concept implicitly defined by axioms was the essence of mathematical existence.
Under the influence of these views, of the new methodological tools introduced by Hilbert, and of the successful overview of the foundations of geometry thus achieved, many mathematicians went on to promote new views of mathematics and new mathematical activities that in many senses went beyond the views embodied in Hilbert’s approach. On the one hand, a trend that thrived in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, led by Eliakim H.
Moore, turned the study of systems of postulates into a mathematical field in its own right, independent of direct interest in the field of research defined by the systems in question. For instance, these mathematicians defined the minimal set of independent postulates for groups, fields, projective geometry, etc., without then proceeding to investigate of any of these individual disciplines.
On the other hand, prominent mathematicians started to adopt and develop increasingly formalistic views of proof and of mathematical truth, and began applying them in a growing number of mathematical fields. The work of the

$140$

radically modernist mathematician felix hausdorff [VI.68](/part-06/felix-hausdor-18681942) provides important examples of this trend, as he was among the first to consistently associate Hilbert’s achievement with a new, formalistic view of geometry. In 1904 , for instance, he wrote: In all philosophical debates since Kant, mathematics, or at least geometry, has always been treated as heteronomous, as dependent on some external instance of what we could call, for want of a better term, intuition, be it pure or empirical, subjective or scientifically amended, innate or acquired.
The most important and fundamental task of modern mathematics has been to set itself free from this dependency, to fight its way through from heteronomy to autonomy. Hilbert himself would pursue such a point of view around 1918 , when he engaged in the debates about the consistency of arithmetic and formulated his “finitist” program. This program did indeed adopt a strongly formalistic view, but it did so with the restricted aim of solving this particular problem.
It is therefore important to stress that Hilbert’s conceptions of geometry were, and remained, essentially empiricist and that he never regarded his axiomatic analysis of geometry as part of an overall formalistic conception of mathematics. He considered the axiomatic approach as a tool for the conceptual clarification of existing, well-elaborated theories, of which geometry provided only the most prominent example.
The implication of Hilbert’s axiomatic approach for the concept of proof and of truth in mathematics provoked strong reactions from some mathematicians, and prominently so from frege [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925) . Frege’s views are closely related to the changing status of logic at the turn of the twentieth century and its gradual process of mathematization and formalization. This process was an outcome of the successive efforts through the nineteenth century of boole [VI.43](/part-06/george-boole-18151864), de morgan [VI.38] , Grassmann, Charles S.
Peirce, and Ernst Schröder at formulating an algebra of logic. The most significant step toward a new, formal conception of logic, however, came with the increased understanding of the role of the logical quantifiers [I.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar) (universal , ∀, and existential, ∃) in the process of formulating a modern mathematical proof.
This understanding emerged in an informal, but increasingly clear, fashion as part of the process of the rigorization of analysis and the distancing from visual intuition, especially at the hands of Cauchy, bolzano [VI.28](/part-06/bernard-bolzano-17811848), and Weierstrass. It was formally defined and systematically codified for the first II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics time by Frege in his 1879 Begriffsschrift .
Frege’s system, as well as similar ones proposed later by Peano and by russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), brought to the fore a clear distinction between propositional connectives and quantifiers, as well as between logical symbols and algebraic or arithmetic ones. Frege formulated the idea of a formal system, in which one defines in advance all the allowable symbols, all the rules that produce well-formed formulas, all axioms (i . e . , certain preselected, well-formed formulas), and all the rules of inference.
In such systems any deduction can be checked syntactically--in other words, by purely symbolic means. On the basis of such systems Frege aimed to produce theories with no logical gaps in their proofs. This would apply not only to analysis and to its arithmetic foundation--the mathematical fields that provided the original motivation for his work--but also to the new systems of geometry that were evolving at the time. On the other hand, in Frege’s view the axioms of mathematical theories--even if they appear in the formal system merely as well-formed formulas--embody truths about the world.
This is precisely the source of his criticism of Hilbert. It is the truth of the axioms, asserted Frege, that certifies their consistency, rather than the other way around, as Hilbert suggested. We thus see how foundational research in two separate fields--geometry and analysis--was inspired by different methodologies and philosophical outlooks, but converged at the turn of the twentieth century to create an entirely new conception of mathematical proof.
In this conception a mathematical proof is seen as a purely logical construct validated in purely syntactic terms, independently of any visualization through diagrams. This conception has dominated mathematics ever since. Epilogue: Proof in the Twentieth Century The new notion of proof that stabilized at the beginning of the twentieth century provided an idealized model-- broadly accepted to this day--of what should constitute a valid mathematical argument. To be sure, actual proofs devised and published by mathematicians since that time are seldom presented as fully formalized texts.
They typically present a clearly articulated argument in a language that is precise enough to convince the reader that it could--in principle, and perhaps with straightforward (if sustained) effort--be turned into one. Through out the decades, however, some limitations of this dominant idea have gradually emerged

$II$ . $6$ .

The Development of the Idea of Proof

and alternative conceptions of what should count as a valid mathematical argument have become increasingly accepted as part of current mathematical practice. The attempt to pursue this idea systematically to its full extent led, early on and very unexpectedly, to a serious difficulty with the notion of a proof as a completely formalized and purely syntactic deductive argument. In the early $1920s$ , Hilbert and his collaborators developed a fully fledged mathematical theory whose subject matter was “proof,” considered as an object of study in itself.
This theory, which presupposed the formal conception of proof, arose as part of an ambitious program for providing a direct, finitistic consistency proof of arithmetic represented as a formalized system. Hilbert asserted that, just as the physicist examines the physical apparatus with which he carries out his experiments and the philosopher engages in a critique of reason, so the mathematician should be able to analyze mathematical proofs and do so strictly by mathematical means.
About a decade after the program was launched, gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) came up with his astonishing incompleteness theorem [V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem), which famously showed that “mathematical truth” and “provability” were not one and the same thing. Indeed, in any consistent, sufficiently rich axiomatic system (including the systems typically used by mathematicians) there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proved.
Gödel’s work implied that Hilbert’s finitistic program was too optimistic, but at the same time it also made clear the deep mathematical insights that could be obtained from Hilbert’s proof theory. A closely related development was the emergence of proofs that certain important mathematical statements were undecidable. Interestingly, these seemingly negative results have given rise to new ideas about the legitimate grounds for establishing the truth of such statements.
For instance, in 1963 Paul Cohen established that the continuum hypothesis [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) can be neither proved nor disproved in the usual systems of axioms for set theory. Most mathematicians simply accept this idea and regard the problem as solved (even if not in the way that was originally expected), but some contemporary set theorists, notably Hugh Woodin, maintain that there are good reasons to believe that the hypothesis is false. The strategy they follow in order to justify this assertion is fundamentally different from the formal notion of proof:
they devise new axioms, demonstrate that these axioms have very desirable properties, argue that they should therefore be accepted, and then show that they imply the negation of $141$ the continuum hypothesis. (See set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory) for further discussion .) A second important challenge came from the everincreasing length of significant proofs appearing in various mathematical domains.
A prominent example was the classification theorem for finite simple groups [V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups), whose proof was worked out in many separate parts by a large numbers of mathematicians. The resulting arguments, if put together, would reach about ten thousand pages, and errors have been found since the announcement in the early $1980s$ that the proof was complete. It has always been relatively straightforward to fix the errors and the theorem is indeed accepted and used by group theorists.
Nevertheless, the notion of a proof that is too long for a single human being to check is a challenge to our conception of when a proof should be accepted as such. The more recent, very conspicuous cases of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) and the poincaré conjecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture) were hard to survey for different reasons: not only were they long (though nowhere near as long as the classification of finite simple groups) , but they were also very difficult.
In both cases there was a significant interval between the first announcement of the proofs and their complete acceptance by the mathematical community because checking them required enormous efforts by the very few people qualified to do so. There is no controversy about either of these two breakthroughs, but they do raise an interesting sociological problem:
if somebody claims to have proved a theorem and nobody else is prepared to check it carefully (perhaps because, unlike the two theorems just mentioned, this one is not important enough for another mathematician to be prepared to spend the time that it would take), then what is the status of the theorem? Proofs based on probabilistic considerations have also appeared in various mathematical domains, including number theory, group theory, and combinatorics.
It is sometimes possible to prove mathematical statements (see , for example, the discussion of random primality testing in computational number theory [IV.3](/part-04/computational-number-theory)), not with complete certainty, but in such a way that the probability of error is tiny--at most one in a trillion, say. In such cases, we may not have a formal proof, but the chances that we are mistaken in considering the given statement to be true are probably lower than, say, the chance that there is a significant mistake in one of the lengthy proofs mentioned above.
Another challenge has come from the introduction of computer-assisted methods of proof. For instance,
