without reference to the individual numbers example, one important generating function has the$a^{n}$. For formulaf (x) = (1 - \sqrt{1} - 4 x)/2 x. In such cases, one can deduce properties of the sequence from properties off , rather than the other way round.a0, a1, a2, . . . and algebraic combinatorics forms For more on generating functions, see[III.91](/part-03/transforms).

How many edges canthe graph have? Clearly 1 n2 is possible, at least if n is even, since one can then divide up thetwo equal classes and join all vertices in one class to4 n vertices into all vertices in the other. But can there be more edgesthan that? graphs. Letn such that every graph with Here is another example of a typical question aboutk be a positive integer. Must there exist ann vertices always contains either vertices no two of which are joined to each other? Thisk vertices that are all joined to each other or k question is quite easy forbut already fork = 4 it is not obvious that such ank = 3 (where n =$6 suffices)$, n exists.For more on these problems (the first is the founding problem of “extremal graph theory,” while the sec-ond is the founding problem of “Ramsey theory”) and on the study of graphs in general, see probabilistic combinatorics [IV.19](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics).extremal and III.35 Hamiltonians

At first glance, the many theories and equations ofmodern physics exhibit a bewildering diversity: for instance, compare classical mechanics with quantum mechanics, or nonrelativistic physics with relativistic physics, or particle physics with statistical mechanics.However, there are strong unifying themes connecting all of these theories. One of these is the remarkable fact that in all of them the evolution of a physical system over time (as well as the steady states of that sys-tem) is largely controlled by a single object, the hamiltonian as describing the total energy of any given state in thatof that system, which can often be interpreted system. Roughly speaking, each physical phenomenon(e.g., ele ct ro magnetism, atomic bonding, particles in a potential well, etc.) may correspond to a single hamiltonian tum, statistical, etc.) corresponds to a different way H, while each type of mechanics (classical, quan-
