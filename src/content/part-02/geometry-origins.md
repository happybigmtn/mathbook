Introduction

The modern view of geometry was inspired by the novel geometrical theories of hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) and Einstein in the early years of the twentieth century, which built in their turn on other radical reformulations of geometry in the nineteenth century. For thousands of years, the geometrical knowledge of the Greeks, as set out most notably in euclid’s [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) Elements, was held up as a paradigm of perfect rigor, and indeed of human knowledge. The new theories amounted to the over throw of an entire way of thinking.
This essay will pursue the history of geometry, starting from the time of Euclid, continuing with the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, and ending with the work of riemann [VI.49] , klein [VI.57] , and poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912). Along the way, we shall examine how and why the notions of geometry changed so remarkably. Modern geometry itself will be discussed in later parts of this book.

Naive Geometry

Geometry generally, and Euclidean geometry in particular, is informally and rightly taken to be the mathematical description of what you see all around you: a space of three dimensions (left - right , up-down, forwards - backwards) that seems to extend indefinitely far. Objects in it have positions, they some times move around and occupy other positions, and all of these positions can be specified by measuring lengths along straight lines: this object is twenty meters from that one, it is two meters tall, and so on.
We can also measure angles, and there is a subtle relationship between angles and lengths. Indeed, there is another aspect to geometry, which we do not see but which we reason about. Geometry is a mathematical subject that is full of theorems--the isosceles triangle theorem, the Pythagorean theorem, and so on--which collectively summarize what we can say about lengths, angles, shapes, and positions. What distinguishes this aspect

$83$

of geometry from most other kinds of science is its highly deductive nature. It really seems that by taking the simplest of concepts and thinking hard about them one can build up an impressive, deductive body of knowledge about space with out having to gather experimental evidence. But can we? Is it really as simple as that? Can we have genuine knowledge of space with out ever leaving our armchairs? It turns out that we cannot: there are other geometries, also based on the concepts of length and angle, that have every claim to be useful, but that disagree with Euclidean geometry.
This is an astonishing discovery of the early nineteenth century, but, before it could be made, a naive understanding of fundamental concepts, such as straightness, length, and angle, had to be replaced by more precise definitions--a process that took many hundreds of years. Once this had been done, first one and then infinitely many new geometries were discovered.

The Greek Formulation

Geometry can be thought of as a set of useful facts about the world, or else as an organized body of knowledge. Either way, the origins of the subject are much disputed. It is clear that the civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia had at least some knowledge of geometry-- otherwise, they could not have built their large cities, elaborate temples, and pyramids. But not only is it difficult to give a rich and detailed account of what was known before the Greeks, it is difficult even to make sense of the few scattered sources that we have from before the time of Plato and Aristotle.
One reason for this is the spectacular success of the later Greek writer, and author of what became the definitive text on geometry, Euclid of Alexandria (ca . $300$ b . c . e .) . One glance at his famous Elements shows that a proper account of the history of geometry will have to be about something much more than the acquisition of geometrical facts. The Elements is a highly organized, deductive body of knowledge. It is divided into a number of distinct themes, but each theme has a complex theoretical structure.
Thus, whatever the origins of geometry might have been, by the time of Euclid it had become the paradigm of a logical subject, offering a kind of knowledge quite different from, and seemingly higher than, knowledge directly gleaned from ordinary experience. Rather, therefore, than attempt to elucidate the early history of geometry, this essay will trace the high road

about this question, but it is worth noting that the most celebrated Greek theory of the universe, developed by Aristotle and many later commentators, assumed that space was finite, bounded by the sphere of the fixed stars. The mathematical space of the Elements is infinite, and so one has at least to consider the possibility that, for all these writers, mathematical space was not intended as a simple idealization of the physical world.

Arab and Islamic Commentators

What we think of today as Greek geometry was the work of a handful of mathematicians, mostly concentrated in a period of less than two centuries. They were eventually succeeded by a some what larger number of Arabic and Islamic writers, spread out over a much greater area and a longer time. These writers tend to be remembered as commentators on Greek mathematics and science, and for transmitting them to later Western authors, but they should also be remembered as creative, innovative mathematicians and scientists in their own right.
A number of them took up the study of Euclid’s Elements, and with it the problem of the parallel postulate. They too took the view that it was not a proper postulate, but one that could be proved as a theorem using the core alone. Among the first to attempt a proof was Thābit ibn Qurra. He was a pagan from near Aleppo who lived and worked in Baghdad, where he died in $901$ . Here there is room to describe only his first approach.
He argued that if two lines $m$ and $n$ are crossed by a third, k, and if they approach each other on one side of the line k, then they diverge indefinitely on the other side of k. He deduced that two lines that make equal alternate angles with a transversal (the marked angles in figure $1$ ) cannot approach each other on one side of a transversal: the symmetry of the situation would imply that they approached on the other side as well, but he had shown that they would have to diverge on the other side.
From this he deduced the Euclidean theory of parallels, but his argument was also flawed, since he had not considered the possibility that two lines could diverge in both directions. The distinguished Islamic mathematician and scientist ibn al-Haytham was born in Basra in $965$ and died in Egypt in 1041 . He took a quadrilateral with two equal sides perpendicular to the base and dropped a perpendicular from one side to the other.
He now attempted to prove that this perpendicular is equal to the base, and to do so he argued that as one of two original perpendiculars is moved toward the other, its tip sweeps

This amounts to the assumption that the curve every where equidistant from a straight line is itself straight, from which the parallel postulate easily follows, and so his attempt fails.
His proof was later heavily criticized by Omar Khayyam for its use of motion, which he found fundamentally unclear and alien to Euclid’s Elements. It is indeed quite distinct from any use Euclid had for motion in geometry, because in this case the nature of the curve obtained is not clear: it is precisely what needs to be analyzed. The last of the Islamic attempts on the parallel postulate is due to Nas.ır al-Dı̄n al-T.ūsı̄. He was born in Iran in 1201 and died in Baghdad in 1274 .
His extensive commentary is also one of our sources of knowledge of earlier Islamic mathematical work on this subject. Al-T.ūsı̄ focused on showing that if two lines begin to converge, then they must continue to do so until they eventually meet. To this end he set out to show that (∗) if $l$ and $m$ are two lines that make an angle of less than a right angle, then every line perpendicular to l meets the line m.

He showed that if (∗) is true, then the parallel postulate follows. However, his argument for (∗) is flawed. It is genuinely difficult to see what is wrong with some of these arguments if one uses only the techniques available to mathematicians of the time. Islamic mathematicians showed a degree of sophistication that was not to be surpassed by their Western successors until the eighteenth century.
Unfortunately, however, their writings did not come to the attention of the West until much later, with the exception of a single work in the Vatican Library, published in 1594 , which was for many years erroneously attributed to al-T.ūsı̄ (and which may have been the work of his son).

The Western Revival of Interest

The Western revival of interest in the parallel postulate came with the second wave of translations of Greek mathematics, led by Commandino and Maurolico in the sixteenth century and spread by the advent of printing. Important texts were discovered in a number of older libraries, and ultimately this led to the production of new texts of Euclid’s Elements.
Many of these had something to say about the problem of parallels, pithily referred to by Henry Savile as “a blot on Euclid.” For example, the powerful Jesuit Christopher Clavius, who edited and reworked the Elements in 1574 , tried to argue that parallel lines could be defined as equidistant lines. The ready identification of physical space with the space of Euclidean geometry came about gradually during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, after the acceptance of Copernican astronomy and the abolition of the so-called sphere of fixed stars.
It was canonized by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) in his Principia Mathematica, which proposed a theory of gravitation that was firmly situated in Euclidean space. Although Newtonian physics had to fight for its acceptance, Newtonian cosmology had a smooth path and became the unchallenged orthodoxy of the eighteenth century. It can be argued that this identification raised the stakes, because any unexpected or counter intuitive conclusion drawn solely from the core of the Elements was now, possibly, a counter intuitive fact about space.
In 1663 the English mathematician John Wallis took a much more subtle view of the parallel postulate than any of his predecessors. He had been instructed by Halley, who could read Arabic, in the contents of the apocryphal edition of al-T.ūsı̄’s work in the Vatican Library, and he too gave an attempted proof. Unusually, Wallis

$87$

also had the insight to see where his own argument was flawed, and commented that what it really showed was that, in the presence of the core, the parallel postulate was equivalent to the assertion that there exist similar figures that are not congruent. Half a century later, Wallis was followed by the most persistent and thoroughgoing of all the defenders of the parallel postulate, Gerolamo Saccheri, an Italian Jesuit who published in 1733 , the year of his death, a short book called Euclid Freed of Every Flaw. This little masterpiece of classical reasoning opens with a trichotomy.
Unless the parallel postulate is known, the angle sum of a triangle may be either less than, equal to, or greater than two right angles. Saccheri showed that whatever happens in one triangle happens for them all, so there are apparently three geometries compatible with the core. In the first, every triangle has an angle sum less than two right angles (call this case L) . In the second, every triangle has an angle sum equal to two right angles (call this case E) . In the third, every triangle has an angle sum greater than two right angles (call this case G).
Case E is, of course, Euclidean geometry, which Saccheri wished to show was the only case possible. He therefore set to work to show that each of the other cases independently self-destructed. He was successful with case G, and then turned to case L “which alone obstructs the truth of the [parallel] axiom,” as he put it. Case L proved to be difficult, and during the course of his investigations Saccheri established a number of interesting propositions. For example, if case L is true, then two lines that do not meet have just one common perpendicular, and they diverge on either side of it.
In the end, Saccheri tried to deal with his difficulties by relying on foolish statements about the behavior of lines at infinity: it was here that his attempted proof failed. Saccheri’s work sank slowly, though not completely, into obscurity. It did, however, come to the attention of the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert, who pursued the trichotomy but, unlike Saccheri, stopped short of claiming success in proving the parallel postulate. Instead the work was abandoned, and was published only in 1786 , after his death.
Lambert distinguished carefully between unpalatable results and impossibilities. He had a sketch of an argument to show that in case L the area of a triangle is proportional to the difference between two right angles and the angle sum of the triangle. He knew that in case L similar triangles had to be congruent, which would imply that the

If, again in Euclidean geometry, one takes the family of all lines through a common point Q and chooses another point P, then there will be a curve through P that is perpendicular to all the lines: the circle with center Q that passes through P (figure $6$ ) . The curve defined by Bolyai and Lobachevskii has some of the properties of both these Euclidean constructions: it is perpendicular to all the parallels, but it is curved and not straight. Bolyai called such a curve an L-curve.
Lobachevskii more helpfully called it a horocycle, and the name has stuck. Their complicated arguments took both men into three-dimensional geometry. Here Lobachevskii’s arguments were some what clearer than Bolyai’s, and both men notably surpassed Gauss. If the figure defining a horocycle is rotated about one of the parallel lines, the lines become a family of parallel lines in three dimensions and the horocycle sweeps out a bowl-shaped surface, called the Fsurface by Bolyai and the horosphere by Lobachevskii. Both men now showed that something remarkable happens.
Planes through the horosphere cut it either in circles or in horocycles, and if a triangle

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

is drawn on a horosphere whose sides are horocycles, then the angle sum of such a triangle is two right angles. To put this another way, although the space that contains the horosphere is a three-dimensional version of case L, and is definitely not Euclidean, the geometry you obtain when you restrict attention to the horosphere is (two dimensional) Euclidean geometry!
Bolyai and Lobachevskii also knew that one can draw spheres in their three-dimensional space, and they showed (though in this they were not original) that the formulas of spherical geometry hold independently of the parallel postulate. Lobachevskii now used an ingenious construction involving his parallel lines to show that a triangle on a sphere determines and is determined by a triangle in the plane, which also determines and is determined by a triangle on the horosphere.
This implies that the formulas of spherical geometry must determine formulas that apply to the triangles on the horosphere. On checking through the details, Lobachevskii, and in more or less the same way Bolyai, showed that the triangles on the horosphere are described by the formulas of hyperbolic trigonometry. The formulas for spherical geometry depend on the radius of the sphere in question. Similarly, the formulas of hyperbolic trigonometry depend on a certain real parameter. However, this parameter does not have a similarly clear geometrical interpretation.
That defect apart, the formulas have a number of reassuring properties. In particular, they closely approximate the familiar formulas of plane geometry when the sides of the triangles are very small, which helps to explain how this geometry could have remained undetected for so long--it differs very little from Euclidean geometry in small regions of space. Formulas for length and area can be developed in the new setting: they show that the area of a triangle is proportional to the amount by which the angle sum of the triangle falls short of two right angles.
Lobachevskii, in particular, seems to have felt that the very fact that there were neat and plausible formulas of this kind was enough reason to accept the new geometry. In his opinion, all geometry was about measurement, and theorems in geometry were unfailing connections between measurements expressed by formulas. His methods produced such formulas, and that, for him, was enough. Bolyai and Lobachevskii, having produced a description of a novel three-dimensional geometry, raised the question of which geometry is true:
is it Euclidean geometry or is it the new geometry for some value of the parameter that could presumably be determined

Cross-ratios and distances in conics. A projective transformation of the plane sends four distinct points on a line, A, B, C, D, to four distinct collinear points, A , B , C , D , in such a way that the quantity

This quantity is called the cross-ratio of the four points A, B, C, D, and is written CR (A , B, C, D). In 1871 , Klein described non-Euclidean geometry as the geometry of points inside a fixed conic, K, where the transformations allowed are the projec D R Q P A K Figure $7$ Three points, P, Q, and R, on a non-Euclidean straight line in Klein’s projective model of non-Euclidean geometry. model.
He then used his new disk model to connect complex function theory, the theory of linear differential equations, riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) theory, and non-Euclidean geometry to produce a rich new body of ideas. Then, in 1891 , he pointed out that the disk model permitted one to show that any contradiction in non-Euclidean geometry would yield a contradiction in Euclidean geometry as well, and vice versa. Therefore, Euclidean geometry was consistent if and only if non-Euclidean geometry was consistent.
A curious consequence of this was that if any body had managed to derive the parallel postulate from the core of Euclidean geometry, then they would have inadvertently proved that Euclidean geometry was inconsistent! One obvious way to try to decide which geometry described the actual universe was to appeal to physics. But Poincaré was not convinced by this. He argued in another paper ( 1902 ) that experience was open to many

tive transformations that map K to itself and its interior to its interior (see figure $7$ ) . To define the distance between two points P and Q inside K, Klein noted that if the line PQ is extended to meet K at A and D, then the cross-ratio CR (A , P, D, Q) does not change if one applies a projective transformation: that is, it is a projective invariant. More over, if R is a third point on the line PQ and the points lie in the order P, Q , R, then CR (A , P, D, Q) CR (A , Q , D, R)  =  CR (A , P, D, R).
Accordingly, he defined the distance between P and Q as d (PQ) $= - \frac{1}{2}$ log CR (A , P, D, Q) (the factor of $- \frac{1}{2}$ is introduced to facilitate the later introduction of trigonometry). With this definition, distance is additive along a line: d (PQ)  +  d (QR) $=$ d (PR). interpretations and there was no logical way of deciding what belonged to mathematics and what to physics. Imagine, for example, an elaborate set of measurements of angle sums of figures, perhaps on an astronomical scale. Something would have to be taken to be straight, perhaps the paths of rays of light.
Suppose, finally, that the conclusion is that the angle sum of a triangle is indeed less than two right angles by an amount proportional to the area of the triangle. Poincaré said that there were two possible conclusions: light rays are straight and the geometry of space is non-Euclidean; or light rays are some how curved, and space is Euclidean. More over, he continued, there was no logical way to choose between these possibilities. All one could do was to make a convention and abide by it, and the sensible convention was to choose the simpler geometry: Euclidean geometry.
This philosophical position was to have a long life in the twentieth century under the name of conventionalism, but it was far from accepted in Poincaré’s lifetime. A prominent critic of conventionalism was the Italian Federigo Enriques, who, like Poincaré, was both a powerful mathematician and a writer of popular essays on issues in science and philosophy. He argued that one could decide whether a property was geometrical or physical by seeing whether we had any control over it. We cannot vary the law of gravity, but we can change the force of gravity at a point by moving matter around.
Poincaré had compared his disk model to a metal disk that was hot in the center and got cooler as one moved outwards. He had shown that a simple law of cooling produced figures identical to those of non-Euclidean geometry. Enriques replied that heat was
