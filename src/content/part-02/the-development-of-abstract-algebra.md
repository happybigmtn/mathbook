likewise something we can vary. A property such as Poincaré invoked, which was truly beyond our control, was not physical but geometric. 10 Looking Ahead In the end, the question was resolved, but not inits own terms. Two developments moved mathematicians beyond the simple dichotomy posed by Poincaré.Starting in 1899, hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) began an extensive rewriting of geometry along axiomatic lines, which eclipsed earlier ideas of some Italian mathematicians and opened the way to axiomatic studies of many kinds.
Hilbert’s work captured very well the idea thatif mathematics is sound, it is sound because of the nature of its reasoning, and led to profound invest i-ga tions in mathematical logic. And in 1915 Einstein proposed his general theory of relativity, which is in large part a geometric theory of gravity. confidence in mathematics was restored; our sense of geometry was much enlarged, and our insights into the rela-tion ships between geometry and space became considerably more sophisticated.
Einstein made full use of contemporary ideas about geometry, and his achieve-ment would have been unthinkable with out Riemann’s work. He described gravity as a kind of curvature in the four-dimensional manifold of spacetime (see general relativity and the einstein equations [IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)). His work led to new ways of thinking about the large-scale structure of the universe and its ultimate fate, and to questions that remain unanswered to this day.

Abstract Algebra

1 Introduction

What is algebra? To the high school student encoun-tering it for the first time, algebra is an unfamiliar abstract language ofx’s and$y$’s,$a$’s and$b$’s, together with rules for manipulating them. These letters, someof them variables and some constants, can be used for many purposes. For example, one can use them to express straight lines as equations of the formy =ax +b, which can be graphed and there by visualized in the Cartesian plane.
Further more, by manipulating and interpreting these equations, it is possible to determine such things as what a given line’s root is (if it has one)—that is, where it crosses the$x$-axis—and what its slope is—that is, how steep or flat it appears in the plane relative to the axis system. There are also techniques for solving simultaneous equations, or equivalently for determining when and where two lines intersect (or demonstrating that they are parallel). niques and abstract manipulations involved in deal-ing with lines, the ante is upped.
More complicated Just when there already seem to be a lot of tech curves like quadratics, cubics, y = ax3 + bx2 y+=cxax + 2 d+, and quartics, bx + c, and eveny = ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e, enter the picture, but the same sort of notation and rules apply, and similar sorts of questions are asked. Where are the roots of a given curve? Given two curves, where do they intersect?Suppose now that the same high school student, having mastered this sort of algebra, goes on to university and at tends an algebra course there.
Essentially gone are the by now familiar ti ally gone are the nice graphs that provide a way to x’s,$y$’s,$a$’s, and$b$’s; es sen picture what is going on. The university course reflects some brave new world in which the algebra has some how become “modern.” this abstract structures—groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), modern algebra involves rings [III.81 §1](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules), fields [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), and other so-called objects—each one defined in terms of a relatively small number of axioms and built up of substructures like
subgroups, ideals, and subfields. There is a lot of moving around between these objects, too, via maps like group homomorphisms and ring automorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). One objective of this new type of algebra is to understand the underlying structure of the objects and, in doing so, to build entire theories of groups or rings or fields. these abstract theories may then be applied in diverse settings where the basic axioms are satisfied but where itmay not be at all apparent a priori that a group or a ring or a field may be lurking.
This, in fact, is one of modern algebra’s great strengths: once we have proved a gen-eral fact about an algebraic structure, there is no need to prove that fact separately each time we come across an instance of that structure. This abstract approach allows us to recognize that contexts that may look quite different are in fact importantly similar.
sis of polynomial equations and the modern algebra of How is it that two endeavors—the high school analythe research mathematician—so seemingly different in their objectives, in their tools, and in their philosophical out looks are both called “algebra”? Are they even related? In fact, they are, but the story of how they are is long and complicated. From Old Babylon to the Hellenistic Era2 Algebra before There Was Algebra:
Solutions of what would today be recognized as first-and second-degree polynomial equations may be found in Old Babylonian cuneiform texts that date to the sec-ond millennium b.c.e. However, these problems were neither written in a notation that would be recogniz-able to our modern-day high school student nor solved using the kinds of general techniques so characteris-tic of the high school algebra classroom. Rather, particular problems were posed, and particular solutions obtained, from a series of recipe-like steps.
No general theoretical justification was given, and the problems were largely cast geometrically, in terms of measurable line segments and surfaces of particular areas. Con - sider, for example, this problem, translated and transcribed from a clay tablet held in the British Museum (catalogued as BM 13901, problem 1) that dates from between 1800 and 1600 b.c.e.: The surface of my confrontation I have accumulated:45 is it. 1, the projection, you posit. The moiety of 1 you break, 30 append: by 1, 1 is equalside. 30 and 30^ you make hold.
15^ which you have made^ to 45^ you hold in the inside you tear out: 30 the confrontation. This may be translated into modern notation as the equation x2 + 1 x =3, where it is important to notice that the Babylonian number system is base 60, so 45 denotes 45=3. The text then lays out the following4^ algorithm for solving the problem: take 1, the coeffi-cient of the linear term, and halve it to get60 4 1 . Square 1 2 2 II.

The modern2 what is now called the quadratic formula, but the Baby-lonian tablet presents it in the context of a particular problem and repeats it in the contexts of other partic-ular problems. There are no equations in the modern sense; the Babylonian writer is literally effecting a construction of plane figures.
Similar problems and simi-lar algorithmic solutions can also be found in ancient Egyptian texts such as the Rhind papyrus, believed to have been copied in 1650 about a century and a half older.b.c.e. from a text that was ented, untheoretical approach characteristic of texts from this early period and the axiomatic and deductive There is a sharp contrast between the problem-oriapproach thatics in around 300 euclidb.c.e.[VI.2](/part - 06/euclid - ca) introduced into mathemat-in his magisterial, geometrical treatise, the Elements.
(See geometry [II.2](/part - 02/geometry - origins) for a further discussion of this work.) There, building on explicit definitions and a small number of axioms or selfevident truths, Euclid proceeded to deduce known—and almost certainly some hitherto unknown—results within a strictly geometrical context. Geometry donein this axiomatic context defined Euclid’s standard of rigor. But what does this quintessential ly geometrical text have to do with algebra? Consider the sixth propo-sition in Euclid’s Book II, ostensibly a book on plane figures, and in particular quadrilaterals:
If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up ofthe half and the added straight line. While clearly a geometrical construction, it equally clearly describes two constructions—one a rectangle and one a square—that have equal areas. It therefore describes something that we should be able to write as an equation.
Figure 1 gives the picture correspond-ing to Euclid’s construction: he proves that the area of rectangle ADMK equals the sum of rectangles Cdml and HMFG. To do this, he adds the square on CB— namely, square LHGE—to CDML and HMFG. This gives square CDFE. It is not hard to see that this is equivalent to the high school procedure of “completing the square” and to the algebraic equation$(2 a + b)b + a2 =(a + b)2$, which we obtain by setting CB = a and II.3.

Equivalent, yes, but for Euclid this is a spe- cificrical geometrical equivalence. For this reason, he could not deal construction and a particular geometwith anything but positive real quantities, since the sides those terms. Negative quantities did not and could notof a geometrical figure could only be measured in enter into Euclid’s fundamentally geometrical mathematical world.
Nevertheless, in the historical literature, Euclid’s Book II has often been described as dealing with “geometrical algebra,” and, because of our easy translation of the book’s propositions into the lan-guage of algebra, it has been argued, albeit a historically, that Euclid had algebra but simply presented it geometrically.
to be regarded as a pinnacle of mathematical achieve - ment, it was in many ways not typical of the math-Although Euclid’s geometrical standard of rigor came ematics of classical Greek antiquity, a mathematics that focused less on systematization and more on the clever and individualistic solution of particular prob - lems. There is perhaps no better exemplar of this than archimedes [VI.3](/part - 06/archimedes - ca), held by many to have been one of the three or four greatest mathematicians of all time. Still, Archimedes, like Euclid, posed and solved particular problems geometrically.
As long as geometry defined the standard of rigor, not only negative numbers but also what we would recognize as polynomial equations of degree higher than three effectively fell out side the sphere of possible mathemat i-cal discussion. (As in the example from Euclid above, quadratic polynomials result from the geometrical process of completing the square; cubics could conceiv-ably result from the geometrical process of completing the cube;
but quartics and higher-degree polynomials could not be constructed in this way in familiar, three-dimensional space.) However, there was another math- ematician of great importance to the present story, Diophantus of Alexandria (who was active in the middle of the third century c.e.). Like Archimedes, he posed particular problems, but he solved them in an alg or ith-mic style much more reminiscent of the Old Babylonian texts than of Archimedes’ geometrical con struc - tions, and as a result he was able to begin to exceed the bounds of geometry.
eral, indeterminate problems, which he then restricted by specifying that the solutions should have partic-In his text Arithmetica, Diophantus put forward gen ular forms, before providing specific solutions. Heexpressed these problems in a very different way from the purely rhetorical style that held sway for centuries after him. His notation was more algebraic and was ultimately to prove suggestive to sixteenth-century math - ematicians (see below).
In particular, he used special abbreviations that allowed him to deal with the first six positive and negative powers of the unknown as wellas with the unknown to the zeroth power. Thus, whatever his mathematics was, it was not the “geometrical algebra” of Euclid and Archimedes. Consider, for example, this problem from Book II of thethe square of any one of them minus the next fol-Arithmetica: “To find three numbers such that lowing gives a square.” In terms of modern notation, he began by restricting his attention to solutions of the form(x + 1)2-((x2 x++11),2=xx+^2 and1, 4 x(2+x1+)1.
It is easy to see that)^2-(4 x+1) = 4 x^2, so two of the conditions of the problem are immediately satisfied, but he needed(4 x + 1)2 -(x + 1) = 16 x2 + 7 x to be a square as well. Arbitrarily setting 1625 x2, Diophantus then determined that x =7 x2 gave him+ 7 x = what he needed, so a solution was done. He provided no geometrical justification because169,239 ,379, and he was9 in his view none was needed; ation was all he required.
He did not set up what we single numerical soluwould recognize as a more general set of equations and try to find all possible solutions. Diophantus, who lived more than four centuries after Archimedes’ death, was doing neither geometry nor algebra in our modern sense, yet the kinds of problems and the sorts of solutions he obtained for them were very different from those found in the works of either Euclid or Archimedes.
The extent to which Diophantus created a wholly new approach, rather than drawing onan Alexandrian tradition of what might be called “algorithmic algebraic,” as opposed to “geometric algebraic,” scholarship is unknown. It is clear that by the time Dio-phantus’s ideas were introduced into the Latin West in

the sixteenth century, they suggested new possibilities to mathematicians long conditioned to the authority of geometry. 3 Algebra before There Was Algebra: The Medieval Islamic World The transmission of mathematical ideas was, however, a complex process.
After the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent decline of learning in the West, both the Euclidean and the Diophantine traditions ultimately made their way into the medieval Islamic world. There they were not only preserved—thanks to the active translation initiatives of Islamic scholars—but also studied and extended.al-kh$\bar{w}ariz \bar{m}$ı [VI.5](/part-06/abu-jafar-muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizm-vi55-william-kingdon-cliord-18451879) was a scholar at the royally funded House of Wisdom in Baghdad.
He linked the kinds of geometrical arguments Euclid had presented in Book II of his solving algorithms that dated back to Old Babylonian Elements with the indigenous problem times. In particular, he wrote a book on practical math-ematics, entitled al-Ki$\bar{t}$ ab al-mukhtas.ar $\bar{f}$ı h.i$\bar{s}$ ab al-jabr wa’l-mu$\bar{q}$ abala (“The compendious book on calculation by completion and balancing”), beginning it witha theoretical discussion of what we would now recognize as polynomial equations of the first and second degrees.
(The latinization of the word “al-jabr” or “completion” in his title gave us our modern term “alge-bra.”) Because he employed neither negative numbers nor zero coefficients, al-Kh$\bar{w}ariz \bar{m}$ı provided a systematization in terms of six separate kinds of examples where we would need just one, namely$ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$. He considered, for example, the case when “a square and 10 roots are equal to 39 units,” and his algorithmic solution in terms of multiplications, additions, and subtractions was in precisely the same form as the above solution from tablet BM 13901.

(A$\bar{b}$ mathematician of the generation after al-Kh$\bar{w}$ u $\bar{K}$ amil (ca.

This juxtaposition made explicit how the relationships between geometrical areas and lines could be interpreted in terms ofnumerical multiplications, additions, and subtractions,

However, like A$\bar{b}$ u-. ar{K}amil, he was aware of the Diophantine tradition too, and synthe-sized in more general terms some of the procedures Diophantus had laid out in the context of specific exam-ples in the Arithmetica. Although Diophantus’s ideas and style were known to these and other medieval Islamic mathematicians, they would remain unknown in the Latin West until their rediscovery and translation in the sixteenth century.
Equally unknown inthe Latin West were the accomplishments of Indian mathematicians, who had succeeded in solving some quadratic equations algorithmically by the beginning of the eighth century and who, like Bragmagupta four hundred years later, had techniques for finding integer solutions to particular examples of what are today called Pell’s equations, namely, equations of the form $ax2 + b = y2$, where a and b are integers and a is not a square. 4 Algebra before There Was Algebra:
The Latin West Concurrent with the rise of Islam in the East, the Latin West under went a gradual cultural and polit-ical stabilization in the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire. By the thirteenth century, this relative stability had resulted in the firm entrenchment of the Catholic Church as well as the establish-ment both of universities and of an active economy. More over, the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula in the eighth century and the subsequent establishment there of an Islamic court, library, and

research facility similar to the House of Wisdom in Baghdad brought the fruits of medieval Islamic scholarship to western Europe’s doorstep. However, as Islam found its position on the Iberian peninsula increas-ingly compromised in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, this Islamic learning, as well as some of the ancient Greek scholarship that the medieval Islamic scholars had preserved in Latin translation, began to filter into medieval Europe.
In particular,[VI.6](/part-06/leonardo-of-pisa-known-as-fibonacci-vi57-christian-felix-klein-18491925), son of an influential administrator within the fibonacci Pisan city state, encountered al-Kh$\bar{w}$ recognized not only the impact that the Arabic num-ariz$\bar{m}$ı’s text and ber system detailed there could have on accounting and commerce (Roman numerals and their cumber-some rules for manipulation were still widely in use) but also the importance of al-Kh. ar{w}discussion, with its wedding of geometrical proof andariz$\bar{m}$ı’s theoretical the algorithmic solution of what we can

So-called abacus schools (named Fibonacci’s presentation, especially of the practi-ariz$\bar{m}$ı’s text, soon became well after Fibonacci’s text and not after the Chinese calcul at-ing instrument) sprang up all over the Italian peninsula, particularly in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, for the training of accountants and bookkeepers in an increasingly mercantilistic Western world. The teach-ers in these schools, the “maestri d’abaco,” built on and extended the algorithms they found in Fibonacci’stext.
Another tradition, the Cossist tradition—after the German word “Coss” connoting algebra, that is, “Kun-strechnung” or “artful calculation”—developed simultaneously in the Germanic regions of Europe and aimed to introduce algebra into the mainstream there. this is the operative word: Pacioli’s text is one of the earliest In 1494 the Italian Luca Pacioli published (by now printed mathematical texts) a compendium of all known mathematics.
By this time, the geometrical justifications that al-Kh$\bar{w}ariz \bar{m}$ı and Fibonacci had presented had long since fallen from the mathematical ver-nacular. By reintroducing them in his book, the Summa, Pacioli brought them back to the mathematical fore. Not knowing of Khayyam’s work, he asserted that solutions had been discovered only in the six cases treated by both al-Kh$\bar{w}ariz \bar{m}$ıand Fibonacci, even though there had been abortive attempts to solve the cubic and even

And, if so, could these be Pacioli’s book had highlighted a key unsolved prob justified geometrically with proofs similar in spirit to those found in the texts of al-Kh. ar{w}ariz . ar{m}ıand Fibonacci? Among several sixteenth-century Italian mathematicians who eventually managed to answer the first ques-tion in the affirmative was cardano [VI.7](/part-06/girolamo-cardano-15011576).
In his Ars Magna, or The Great Art, of 1545, he presented algorithms with geometric justifications for the various cases of the cubic, effectively completing the cube where al - Kh. ar{w}square. He also presented algorithms that had been dis - ariz$\bar{m}$ı and Fibonacci had completed the covered by his student Ludovico Ferrari (1522–65) for solving the cases of the quartic. These intrigued him, because, unlike the algorithms for the cubic, they were not justified geometrically.
As he put it in his book, “all those matters up to and including the cubic are fully demonstrated, but the others which we will add, either by necessity or out of curiosity, we do not go beyond barely setting out.” An algebra was breaking out of the geometrical shell in which it had been encased. 5 Algebra Is Born This process was accelerated by the rediscovery and translation into Latin of Diophantus’s Arithmetica in the 1560 s, with its abbreviated presentational style and ungeometrical approach.
Algebra, as a general problem-solving technique, applicable to questions ingeometry, number theory, and other mathematical settings, was established in Algebra of 1572 and, more importantly, in raphael bombelli’s [VI.8](/part - 06/rafael - bombelli - 1526after)viète’s [VI.9](/part - 06/franois - vite - 15401603)to the Analytic Art In Artem Analyticem Isagoge, of 1591.
The aim of the latter, or Introduction was, in Viète’s words, “to leave no problem unsolved,”and to this end he developed a true notation—using vowels to denote variables and consonants to denote coefficients—as well as methods for solving equations in one unknown. He called his techniques “specious logistics.”Dimensionality—in the form of his so-called law of homogeneity As he put it, “[o]nly homogeneous magnitudes are—was, however, still an issue for Viète. to be compared to one another.” The problem was that he distinguished two types of magnitudes:
“ladder magnitudes”—that is, variables (modern notation), ( A square) (or x2 A), (side) (or A cube) (orx in ourx^3),

100

etc.; and “compared magnitudes”—that is, coefficients(B length) of dimension one, (B plane) of dimension two, (B solid) of dimension three, etc. In the light of his law of homogeneity, then, Viète could legitimately perform the operation(A cube)+(B plane)(A side) (orx3+bx in our notation), since the dimension of (A cube) is three, as is that of the product of the two-dimensional coefficient (B plane) and the one-dimensional vari- able (dimensional variable (A side), but he could not legally add the three-A cube) to the two-dimensional product of the one-dimensional coefficient (and the
one-dimensional variable (A side) (or, again, B length)x3 + bxin our notation). Be this as it may, his “analytic art” still allowed him to add, subtract, multiply, and divide letters as opposed to specific numbers, and those letters, as long as they satisfied the law of homo - geneity, could be raised to the second, third, fourth, or, indeed, any power.
He had a rudimentary algebra, although he failed to apply it to curves. The first mathematicians to do that were fermat [VI.12](/part - 06/pierre - fermat - 1601665) and development of the analytic geometry so familiar todescartes [VI.11](/part - 06/ren - descartes - 15961650) in their independent the high school algebra student of today. Fermat, and others like Thomas Harriot (ca.
1560–1621) in England, were influenced in their approaches by Viète, while Descartes not only introduced our present-day notational convention of representing variables by x’s and$y$’s and constants by$a$’s,$b$’s, and$c$’s but also began the arithmetization of algebra. He introduced a unit that allowed him to interpret all geometrical magnitudes as line segments, whether they were$x^{4}$’s, or any higher power ofx, there by removing con-x’s,$x^{2}$’s,$x^{3}$’s, cerns about homogeneity.
Fermat’s main work in this direction was a 1636 manuscript written in Latin, entitled “Introduction to plane and solid loci” and circu-lated among the early seventeenth-century mathematical cognoscenti; Descartes’s wasin French as one of three appendices to his philosoph-La Géométrie, written ical tract, Both were regarded as establishing the identification Discours de la Méthode, published in 1637.

In Fermat’s case, the curves were ge ol in es or conic sections—quadratic expressions inand$y$; Descartes did this too, but he also considered$x$ equations more generally, tackling questions about the roots of polynomial equations that were connected with transforming and reducing the polynomials.

In his further exploration of these issues, more over, he developed algebraic techniques, involving suitable transformations, for analyzing polynomial equations of the fifth and sixth degrees. Liber-ated from homogeneity concerns, Descartes was thus able to use his algebraic techniques freely to explore territory where the geometrically bound Cardano had clearly been reluctant to venture.
newton [VI.14](/part - 06/isaac - newton - 16421727) took the liberation of algebra from geometrical concerns astep further in his Arithmetica Universalis (or Universal arithmetic met ization of algebra, that is, for modeling algebra and) of 1707, arguing for the complete arith algebraic operations on the real numbers and the usual operations of arithmetic. Descartes’s La Géométrie highlighted at least two problems for further algebraic exploration: the funda-mental theorem of algebra and the solution of polynomial equations of degree greater than four.
Although eighteenth - century mathematicians like[VI.20](/part - 06/jean - le - rond - dalembert - 17171783) and euler [VI.19](/part - 06/leonhard - euler - 17071783) attempted proofs of the fun - d’alembert da mental theorem of algebra, the first person to prove it rigorously was gauss [VI.26](/part - 06/carl - friedrich - gauss - 17771855), who gave four distinct proofs over the course of his career.
His first, an algebraic geometrical proof, appeared in his doctoral dis-sertation of 1799, while a second, fundamentally different proof was published in 1816, which in modern terminology essentially involved constructing the polynomial’s splitting field. While the fundamental theorem of algebra established how many roots a given poly-nomial equation has, it did not provide insight into exactly what those roots were or how precisely to find them.
That problem and its many mathematical repercussions exercised a number of mathematicians in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and formed one of the strands of the mathematical thread that became modern algebra in the early twentieth century. Another emerged from attempts to understand the general behavior of systems of (one or more) polynomials inapproach number-theoretic questions algebraically.nunknowns, and yet another grew from efforts to II.3.
The Development of Abstract Algebra 6 The Search for the Roots of Algebraic Equations The problem of finding roots of polynomials provides a direct link from the algebra of the high school classroom to that of the modern research mathematician. Today’s high school student dutifully employs the quadratic formula to calculate the roots of seconddegree polynomials. To derive this formula, one trans-forms the given polynomial into one that can be solved more easily. By more complicated manipulations of cubics and quartics, Cardano and Ferrari obtained formulas for the roots of those as well.
It is natural to ask whether the same can be done for higher-degree poly - nomials. More precisely, are there formulas that involve just the usual operations of arithmetic—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—together with the extraction of roots? When there is such a formula, one says that the equation is solvable by radicals.
(including Euler, Alexandre - Théophile Vandermonde Although many eighteenth - century mathematicians (1735–96),83)) contributed to the effort to decide whether higher - waring [VI.21](/part - 06/edward - waring - ca), and Étienne Bézout (1730 order polynomial equations are solvable by radicals, it was not until the years from roughly 1770 to 1830 that there were significant breakthroughs, particularly in the work of lagrange [VI.22](/part - 06/joseph - louis - lagrange - 17361813), abel [VI.33](/part - 06/niels - henrik - abel - 18021829), and Gauss.
algébrique des équations” (Reflections on the algebraic In a lengthy set of “Réflections sur la résolution resolution of equations) published in 1771, lagrange tried to determine principles underlying the resolution of algebraic equations in general by analyzing in detail the specific cases of the cubic and the quartic.
Build-ing on the work of Cardano, Lagrange showed that a cubic of the formx3 + ax2 + bx + c = 0 could always be transformed into a cubic with no quadratic termx3 + px + q = 0 and that the roots of this could be written asx = u + v , where u3 and v3 are the roots of a certain quadratic polynomial equation. Lagrange was then able to show that if roots of the cubic, the intermediate functions$x^{1}$, x2, x3 are the threeu and v could actually be written asand$v = 1 (x +α2x +αx )$, foru =α^1^3 a primitive cube root(x^1 + αx^2 + α^2 x^3) of unity.
That is, expressions or resolvents in3 1 u2 and v3 could be written as ration alx , x , x . Conversely, starting with a linear expression in the roots$x^{1}$, x2, x3 and then permuting the roots1 y =2 A(x3)1 + Bx2 + Cx3 in all possible ways yielded six expressions each of which was a root of a particular sixth-degree polynomial equation. An analysis of the latter equation (which

involved the exploitation of properties of symmetric polynomials) yielded the same expressions foru and v in terms of$x1$, x2, x3 and the cube root of unity α. As Lagrange showed, this kind of two-pronged analysis—involving intermediate expressions rational in the roots that are solutions of a solvable equation as well as the behavior of certain rational expressions under permutation of the roots—yielded the complete solution in the cases both of the cubic and the quartic. It was approach that encompassed the solution of both types one of equation.
But could this technique be extended tothe case of the quintic and higher-degree polynomials? Lagrange was unable to push it through in the case of the quintic, but by building on his ideas, first his stu-dent Paolo Ruffini (1765–1822) at the turn of the nineteenth century and then, definitively, the young Norwe-gian mathematician Abel in the 1820 s showed that, in fact, the quintic is not solvable by radicals.
(See the insolubility of the quintic result, however, still left open the questions of which[V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic).) This negative algebraic equations As Lagrange’s analysis seemed to underscore, the were solvable by radicals and why. answer to this question in the cases of the cubic and the quartic involved in a critical way the cube and fourth roots of unity, respectively. By definition, these satisfy the particularly simple polynomial equations andx4 - 1 = 0, respectively.
It was thus natural tox3 - 1 = 0 examine the general case of the so-called cyclotomic equationxn - 1 = 0 and ask for what values n then this question in equivalent algebraic terms: for which th roots of unity are actually constructible. To put nunity that expresses them in terms of integers using theis it possible to find a formula for thenth roots of usual arithmetical operations and extraction of square(but not higher) roots? This was one of the many questions explored by Gauss in his wide - ranging, magiste - rial, and groundbreaking 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.
One of his most famous results was that the regular 17 - gon (or, equivalently, a 17 th root of unity) was constructible. In the course of his analysis, he not only employed techniques similar to those devel-oped by Lagrange but also developed key concepts such asthe modular “worlds”modular arithmetic Z , for[III.58](/part - 03/modular - arithmetic) and the properties ofp a prime, and, more gen - erally, tive element (a generator) of what would later be termed Z$n$, for n \in Z+, as well as the notion of a primi - p a cyclic group. Although it is not clear how well he knew Gauss’s work, in the
years around 1830 from the ideas both of Lagrange on the analysis of galois [VI.41](/part - 06/variste - galois - 18111832) drew 102 resolvents and of substitutions to obtain a solution to the general prob - cauchy [VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) on permutations and lem of solvability of polynomial equations by radicals. Although his approach borrowed from earlier ideas, it was in one important respect fundamentally new.
Where as prior efforts had aimed at deriving analgorithm for calculating the roots of a polynomial of a explicit given degree, Galois formulated a theoretical process based on constructs more general than but derived from the given equation that allowed him to assess whether or not that equation was solvable To be more precise, Galois recast the problem into. one in terms of two new concepts: fields (which he called “domains of rationality”) and groups (or, more precisely, groups of substitutions).
A polynomial equationf (x) = 0 of degree n was reducible over its domain of rationality—the ground field from which its coef-ficients were taken—if alln of its roots were in that ground field; otherwise, it was irreducible over that field. It could, however, be reducible over some larger field. Consider, for example, the polynomial$x^{2} + 1 as$ a polynomial over R, the field of real numbers.
While we know from high school algebra that this polynomial does not factor into a product of two real, linear factors (that is, there are no real numbers$r^{1} and r^{2}$ such that over C, the field of complex numbers, and, specifically,$x^{2} + 1 = (x - r^{1})(x - r^{2}))$, it does fac to rx numbers of the form^2 + 1 = (x + . qrt{-1})(xa +-b. qrt. qrt--1$, where1)$. Thus, if we take alla and b belong to polynomial R, then we enlargex2 +1 is reducible.
If Rto a new field F is a field and C in which thex is an element ofa similar process we can adjoin an element F that does not have annth root iny F, then byto F and stipulate thatyn = x. We call y a radical. The set of all polynomial expressions in$y$, with coefficients in F, can be shown to form a larger field. Galois showed thatif it was possible to enlarge F by successively adjoining radicals to obtain a fieldinton linear factors, then f (x)K in which= 0 was solvable byf (x) factored radicals.
He developed a process that hinged both onthe notion of adjoining an element—in particular, a so called primitive element—to a given ground field andon the idea of analyzing the internal structure of this new, enlarged field via an analysis of the (finite) group of substitutions (automorphisms of K) that leave invari- ant all rational relations of the n roots of f (x) = 0. The group-theoretic aspects of Galois’s analysis were par-ticular ly potent; he introduced the notions, although not the modern terminology, of a normal subgroup of agroup, a factor group, and a solvable group. Galois thus

resolved the concrete problem of determining when apolynomial equation was solvable by radicals by examining it from the abstract perspective of groups and their internal structure. Galois’s ideas, although sketched in the early 1830 s, did not begin to enter into the broader mathemat i-cal consciousness until their publication in 1846 in liouville’s [VI.39](/part-06/joseph-liouville-18091882) Journal des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquéestwo decades later when first Joseph Serret (1819–85), and they were not fully appreciated until and then In particular, Jordan’sjordan
[VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922) fleshed them out more fully. Traité des Substitutions et des Équations Algébriqueson algebraic equations”) of 1870 not only highlighted(“Treatise on substitutions and Galois’s work on the solution of algebraic equations but also developed the general structure theory of per-mutation groups as it had evolved at the hands of Lagrange, Gauss, Cauchy, Galois, and others. By the endof the nineteenth century, this line of development of group theory, stemming from efforts to solve algebraic equations by radicals, had intertwined with three others:
the abstract notion of a group defined in terms of a group multiplication table, which was formulated by cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895), the structural work of mathematicians like Ludwig Sylow (1832–1918) and Otto Hölder(1859–1937), and the geometrical work of lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) and1914) codified much of this earlier work by giving the klein [VI.57].
By 1893, when Heinrich Weber (1842 first actual abstract definitions of the notions both of group and field, there by recasting them in a form much more familiar to the modern mathematician, groups and fields had been shown to be of central importance in a wide variety of areas, both mathematical and physical. 7 Exploring the Behavior of Polynomials inn Unknowns The problem of solving algebraic equations involved finding the roots of polynomials in one unknown.
At least as early as the late seventeenth century, however, mathematicians like interested in techniques for solving simultaneously leibniz [VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716) had been systems of linear equations in more than two vari-ables. Although his work remained unknown at the time, Leibniz considered three linear equations in three unknowns and determined their simultaneous solvability based on the value of a particular expression in the coefficients of the system. This expression, equiva-lent to what Cauchy would later call the determinant

II.3. The Development of Abstract Algebra

[III.15](/part-03/determinants) and which would ultimately be associated with ann . imes  n square array or matrix[I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of coefficients, was also developed and analyzed independently by Gabriel Cramer (1704–52) in the mid eighteenth century in the general context of the simultaneous solutionof a system ofn linear equations in n unknowns.
From these beginnings, a theory of determinants, indepen-dent of the context of solving systems of linear equations, quickly became a topic of algebraic study in its own right, attracting the attention of Vandermonde, laplace [VI.23](/part-06/pierre-simon-laplace-17491827), and Cauchy, among others. Determinants were thus an example of a new algebraic construct, the properties of which were then systematically explored.
of whatof matrices proper grew initially from the context not Although determinants came to be viewed in terms sylvester [VI.42](/part - 06/james - joseph - sylvester - 18141897) would dub matrices, a theory of solving simultaneous linear equations but rather oflinearly transforming the variables of homogeneous polynomials in two, three, or more generally ab les.
In the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, for exam - n vari - ple, Gauss considered how binary and ternary quad-ratic forms with integer coefficients—expressions of the forma z2 + 2 aa1 xyx2 ++22 aa2 xyxz ++a23 ay2 yzand, respectively—are$a1 x2 + a2 y2 +$affected by a linear transformation of their variables. In the ternary case, he applied the linear transforma - 3 4 5 6 tionz = αx^ =x^ αx+ β^ +^ yβy^ +^ +γ^ γzz^ to derive a new ternary form., y = α^ x^ + β^ y^ + γ^ z^ , and He denoted the linear transformation of the variablesby the square array α, β, γα, β, γα, β, γ and, in the process of showing
what the composition of two such transformations was, gave an explicit exam-ple of matrix multiplication. By the middle of the nineteenth century, Cayley had begun to explore matrices per se and had established many of the properties that the theory of matrices as a mathematical system in its own right enjoys. This line of algebraic thought was eventually reinterpreted in terms of the theory of alge - bras (see below) and developed into the independent area of linear algebra and the theory of[I.3 §2.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions).
vector spaces Another theory that arose out of the analysis of linear transformations of homogeneous polynomials wasthe theory of invariants, and this too has its origins in 103 some sense in Gauss’sof ternary quadratic forms, Gauss began his study Disquisitiones. As in his study of binary forms by applying a linear transformation, specifically, x = αx^ + βy^ , y = γx^ + δy^ . The result was the new binary form where, explicitly, a^ = aa1α(x2^ +)22 + a2 aαγ2 x+^ ya^ +γ(a2)3, (ya^ )2=, aa1αβδ2.
As Gauss noted, if you multiply the second of + a2(αδ + βγ)1 + a3γδ1, and (a3)2 = a1β2 3 + 2 a2βδ2 + these equations by itself and subtract from this the product of the first and the third equations, you obtain3 the relation use language that Sylvester would develop in the early(a2)2 - a1 a3 = ((a2)2 - a1 a3)(αδ - βγ)2. To 1850 s, Gauss realized that the expression(a2)2 - a1 a3 in the coefficients of the original binary quadratic formis an invariant in the sense that it remains unchanged up to a power of the determinant of the linear trans - formation.
By the time Sylvester coined the term, the invariant phenomenon had also appeared in the work of the English mathematician attracted Cayley’s attention. It was not until after Cay - boole [VI.43](/part - 06/george - boole - 18151864), and had ley and Sylvester met in the late 1840 s, however, that the two of them began to pursue a theory of invariants proper, which aimed to determine all invariants for homogeneous polynomials of degree as well as simultaneous invariants for systems of suchm in n unknowns polynomials.
Although Cayley and (especially) Sylvester pursued this line of research from a
purely algebraic point of view, invariant theory also had number-theoretic and geometric implications, the former explored by Gotthold Eisenstein (1823–52) and latter by Otto Hesse (1811–74), Paul Gordan (1837–hermite [VI.47](/part - 06/charles - hermite - 18221901), the 1912), and Alfred Clebsch (1833–72), among others. It was of particular interest to understand how many“genuinely distinct” invariants were associated with a specific form, or system of forms.
In 1868, gordan achieved a fundamental breakthrough by showing that the invariants associated with any binary form inn vari- ables can always be expressed in terms of a finite num-ber of them. By the late 1880 s and early 1890 s, however, associated with the theory of algebras (see below) to hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) brought new, abstract concepts bear on invariant theory and, in so doing, not only reproved Gordan’s result but also showed that the result was true for forms of deg reem in n unknowns.
With Hilbert’s work, the emphasis shifted from the concrete calculations of his English and German predecessors to the kind of structurally oriented existence theorems that would soon be associated with abstract, modern algebra.

8 The Quest to understand the Properties of “Numbers” As early as the sixth century had studied the properties of numbers formally. Forb.c.e., the Pythagoreans example, they defined the concept of aber, which is a positive integer, such as 6 perfect num-= 1 + 2 + 3$and 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14$, which is the sum of its divisors (excluding the integer itself). In the sixteenth century, Cardano and Bombelli had willingly worked with new expressions, complex numbers, of the form$a + \sqrt{-b}$, for real numbers a and b, and had explored their computational properties.
In the seventeenth century, Fermat famously claimed that he could prove that the equation$x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n}$, for n an integer greater than 2, had no solutions in the integers, except for the trivial cases whenz = x or z = y and the remaining variable is zero. The latter result, known aslast theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem), generated many new ideas, espe-fermat’s cially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as mathematicians worked to find an actual proof of Fermat’s claim.
Central to their efforts were the creation and algebraic analysis of new types of number systems that extended the integers in much the same way that Galois had extended fields. This flexibility to create and analyze new number systems was to become one of the hallmarks of modern algebra as it would develop into the twentieth century. In the proof of Fermat’s last theorem for the case that he gave in his One of the first to venture down this path was Euler. Elements of Algebra of 1770, n = 3 Euler introduced the system of numbers of the form$a + b \sqrt{-3}$, where a and b are integers.
He then blithely proceeded to factorize them into primes, with out further justification, just as he would have factorized ordinary integers. By the 1820 s and 1830 s, Gauss had launched a more systematic study of numbers that are now called the bers of the form Gaussian integers$a + b \sqrt{-1}$, for integers. These are all num-a and b. He showed that, like the integers, the Gaussian integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication;
he defined the notions of unit, prime, and norm in order to prove an analogue ofof arithmetic [V.14](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic) for them. He there by demon-the fundamental theorem strated that there were whole new algebraic worlds to create and explore. (See algebraic numbers [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory) for more on these topics.) Where as Euler had been motivated in his work by Fermat’s last theorem, Gauss was trying to generalize the law of quadratic reciprocity [V.28](/part-05/from-quadratic-reciprocity-to-vi38-augustus-de-morgan-18061871) to a law of

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

biquadratic reciprocity. In the quadratic case, the prob-lem was the following. Ifa and m are integers with mif the equation⩾ 2, then we say thatx2 = a has a solution moda is a quadratic res i duem; that is, mod$m$ if there is an integerx such that x2 is congruent toaprimes. If you know whether mod m. Now suppose that pp andis a quadratic residueq are distinct odd$mod$ q, is there a simple way of telling whether q is a quadratic residue modand answered this question—the status of$p$?
In 1785, Legendre had posedq mod p will be the same as that ofofp and qis congruent to 1 mod 4, and different ifp mod q if at least one they are both congruent to 3 mod 4—but he had given a faulty proof. By 1796, Gauss had come up with the first rigorous proof of the theorem (he would ultimately give eight different proofs of it), and by the 1820 s hewas asking the analogous question for the case of two biquadratic equivalences x4 ≡ p (mod q) and y4 ≡ q(mod tion that he introduced the Gaussian integers and sig - p).
It was in his attempts to answer this new ques- naled at the same time that the theory of residues of higher degrees would make it necessary to create and analyze still other new sorts of “integers.” Although Eisenstein, and kronecker dirichlet[VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891), among others, pushed these[VI.36], Hermite, kummer [VI.40], ideas forward in this Gaussian spirit, it was[VI.50](/part - 06/julius - wilhelm - richard - dedekind - 18311916) in his tenth supplement to Dirichlet’sde de kind Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory ) of 1871 who
fundamentally re conceptual iz ed the prob-lem by treating it not number theoretically but rather set theoretically and axiomatically. Dedekind intro - duced, for example, the general notions—if not what would become the precise axiomatic definitions—of fields, rings, and analyzed his number-theoretic setting in terms of ideals [III.81 §2](/part - 03/rings - ideals - and - modules), and modules [III.81 §3](/part - 03/rings - ideals - and - modules) these new, abstract constructs. His strategy was, froma philosophical point of view, not unlike that of Galois:
translate the “concrete” problem at hand into new, more abstract terms in order to solve it more cleanly at a “higher” level. In the early twentieth century, noether van der Waerden (1903–96), would develop Dedekind’s[VI.76](/part-06/emmy-noether-18821935) and her students, among them Bartel ideas further to help create the structural approach to algebra so characteristic of the twentieth century.
evolution of the notion of “number” on the continent of Europe, a very different set of developments was taking Parallel to this nineteenth-century, number-theoretic place, initially in the British Isles. From the late eighteenth century, British mathematicians had debated not only the nature of number—questions such as,

II.3. The Development of Abstract Algebra

“Do negative and imaginary numbers make sense?”—but also the meaning of algebra—questions like, “In an expression like$y$legitimately take on and what precisely may ‘ax + by, what values may a, b,+x’ con-, and note?” By the 1830 s, the Irish mathematician[VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865) had come up with a “unified” interpretation ofhamilton the complex numbers that circumvented, in his view, the logical problem of adding a real number and an imaginary one, an apple and an orange. Given real num-bersa and b, Hamilton conceived of the complex num- berple”)a(a$, b)+ b \sqrt{}$.
He then defined addition, subtraction, mul--1 as the ordered pair (he called it a “co ut i pl ic at i on, and division of such couples. As he realized, this also provided a way of representing numbers inthe complex plane, and so he naturally asked whether he could construct algebraic, ordered triples so as torepresent points in 3-space.
After a decade of contemplating this question off and on, Hamilton finally answered it not for triples but for quadruples, the so-called quaternions [III.76](/part-03/quaternions-octonions-and-normed-iv25-probabilistic-models-of-critical-phenomena), “numbers” of the form (a, b, c, d)and where i, j, k satisfy the relations ij = a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c= −, andji d=are realk, jk =-kj = i, ki = −ik = j, i2 = j2 = k2 = −1.
As in the two- dimensional case, addition is defined component - wise, but multiplication, while definable in such a way that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, isnot commutative. Thus, this new number system did not obey all of the “usual” laws of arithmetic.
questioned the extent to which mathematicians were free to create such new mathematical worlds, others, Although some of Hamilton’s British contemporaries like Cayley, immediately took the idea further and created a system of ordered 8 - tuples, the octonions, the multiplication of which was neither commutative nor even, as was later discovered, associative. Several questions naturally arise about such systems, but one that Hamilton asked was what happens if the field of coefficients, the base field, is not the reals but rather the complexes?
In that case, it is easy to see that the product of the two nonzero complex quaternions (is 1-. qrt-+1 j,20=, 11,0+) = −(-1. qrt) -=10. In other words, the complex + j and (. qrt{-1},0, 1, 0) = . qrt{-1} + j quaternions contain zero divisors—nonzero elements the product of which is zero—another phenomenon that distinguishes their behavior fundamentally from that of the integers.
As it flourished in the hands of mathematicians like Benjamin Peirce (1809–80), frobenius [VI.58](/part-06/ferdinand-georg-frobenius-18491917), Georg Scheffers (1866–1945), Theodor Molien (1861–1941), Wedderburn (1882–1948), among others, this line of cartan [VI.69](/part-06/lie-joseph-cartan-18691951), and Joseph H. M.

thought resulted in a freestanding theory of algebras. This naturally intertwined with developments in the theory of matrices (theof dimension n2 over their base field) as it had evolve dn . imes n matrices form an algebra through the work of Gauss, Cayley, and Sylvester. It also merged with the not unrelated theory ofn-dimensional vector spaces (sional vector spaces with a vector multiplication asn-dimensional algebras are n - dimen- well as a vector addition and scalar multiplication) that issued from ideas like those of Hermann Grassmann (1809–77).
9 Modern Algebra By 1900, many new algebraic structures had been iden-tified and their properties explored. Structures that were first isolated in one context were then found to appear, some times unexpectedly, in others: thus, these new structures were mathematically more general than the problems that had led to their discovery. In the opening decades of the twentieth century, algebraists(the term is not ahistorical by 1900) increasingly recognized these commonalities—these shared structures such as groups, fields and rings—and asked questions at a more abstract level.
For example, what are all ofthe finite simple groups? Can they be classified? (See the classification of finite simple groups More over, inspired by the set-theoretic and axiomatic[V.7](/part - 05/the - classication - of - finite - simple - groups).) work ofto appreciate the common standard of analysis and cantor [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918), Hilbert, and others, they came comparison that axiomatization could provide.
Coming from this axiomatic point of view, Ernst Steinitz (1871–1928), for example, laid the groundwork for an abstract theory of fields in 1910, while Abraham Fraenkel (1891–1965) did the same for an abstract theory of rings four years later. As van der Waerden came to realize in the late 1920 s, these developments could be interpreted as dovetailing philosophically with results like Hilbert’s ininvariant theory and Dedekind’s and Noether’s in the algebraic theory of numbers.
That interpretation, laid out in 1930 in van der Waerden’s classic textbook Moderne Algebra ern algebra” that subsumed the algebra of polynomials, codified the structurally oriented “modof the high school classroom and that continues to characterize algebraic thought today.

It is not easy to give a precise definition of the word “algorithm.” One can provide approximate synonyms: some other words that (some times) mean roughly the same thing are “rule,” “technique,” “procedure,” and “method.” One can also give good examples, such aslong multiplication, the method one learns in high school for multiplying two positive integers together.
However, although in formal explanations and well-chosen examples do give a good idea of what an algorithm is, the concept has under gone a long evolution: it was not until the twentieth century that a satisfactory formal definition was achieved, and ideas about algorithms have evolved further even since then. In this arti-cle, we shall try to explain some of these developments and clarify the contemporary meaning of the term.

1.1 Abacists and Algorists

Returning to the example of multiplication, an obvious point is that how you try to multiply two numbers together is strongly influenced by how you represent those numbers. To see this, try multiplying the Roman numerals CXLVII and XXIX together with out first converting them into their decimal counterparts, 147 and

29. It is difficult and time-consuming, and explains why arithmetic in the Roman empire was extremely rudimentary. A numeration system can be additive, as itwas for the Romans, or positional, like ours today. If it is positional, then it can use one or several bases—for instance, the Sumerians used both base 10 and base 60.For a long time, many processes of calculation used abacuses on to which one placed stones (the Latin for small stone. Originally, these were lines traced on sand, iscounting tables equipped with rows or columns on to calculus) to represent numbers.
Later there were which one placed tokens. These could be used to rep-resent numbers to a given base. For example, if the base was 10, then a token would represent one unit, ten units, one hundred units, etc., according to which row or column it was in. The four arithmetic operations could then be carried out by moving the tokens accord-ing to precise rules. The Chinese counting frame can be regarded as a version of the abacus. cal works were translated into Latin, the denary posi-tional numeration system spread through Europe.
This In the twelfth century, when the Arabic mathemat i system was particularly suitable for carrying out the arithmetic operations, and led to new methods of cal-culation. The term algoritmus was introduced to refer to these, and to distinguish them from the traditional methods that used tokens on an abacus. Although the signs for the numerals had been adapted from Indian practice, the numerals became known as Arabic. And the origin of the word “algorithm” is Arabic:
it arose from a distortion of the namekh$\bar{w}ariz \bar{m}$ı [VI.5](/part-06/abu-jafar-muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizm-vi55-william-kingdon-cliord-18451879), who was the author of the oldest al known work on algebra, in the first half of the ninth century. His treatise, entitled al-Ki$\bar{t}$ ab al-mukhtas.ar $\bar{f}$ı h.i$\bar{s}$ ab al-jabr wa’l-mu$\bar{q}$ abalaon calculation by completion and balancing”), gave rise(“The compendious book to the word “algebra.”

the seventeenth century, according to[VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) Encyclopédie, the word was used in a more gen-d’alembert’s eral sense, referring not just to arithmetic but also to methods in algebra and to other calculational procedures such as “the algorithm of the integral calculus”or “the algorithm of sines.” tematic calculation that could be carried out by means of very precise rules. Finally, with the growing role of Gradually, the term came to mean any process of sys computers, the important role of understood:
it is essential that the process stops and finiteness was fully provides a result after a finite time. Thus one arrives atthe following naive definition: An algorithm is a set of finitely many rules for manip-ulat ing a finite amount of data in order to produce a result in a finite number of steps. Note the insistence on finiteness: finiteness in the writ-ing of the algorithm and finiteness in the implementation of the algorithm. ical definition in the classical sense of the term.
As we The formulation above is not of course a mathemat shall see later, it was important to formalize it further. But for now, let us be content with this “definition” and look at some classical examples of algorithms in mathematics. 2 Three Historical Examples A feature of algorithms that we have not yet mentionedis iteration, or the repetition of simple procedures. To see why iteration is important, consider once again the example of long multiplication. This is a method that works for positive integers of any size.
As the numbers get larger, the procedure takes longer, but—and this is of vital importance—the method is “the same”: if you understand how to multiply two three-digit num-bers together, then you do not need to learn any new principles in order to multiply two 137-digit numbers together (even if you might be rather reluctant to do the calculation). The reason for this is that the method for long multiplication involves a great deal of carefully structured repetition of much smaller tasks, such as multiplying two one-digit numbers together.
We shall see that iteration plays a very important part in the algorithms to be discussed in this section.

2.1 Euclid’s Algorithm: Iteration

One of the best, and most often used, examples to illus-trate the nature of algorithms is euclid’s algorithm

The method for of Book VII of Euclid’s“Two unequal numbers being set out, and the less being Elements. Here is the first one:
continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left never measures the one before it until a unit is left, the original numbers will be prime to one another.” In other words, if by carrying out successive alternate subtractions one obtains the number 1, then the gcd of the two numbers is equal to 1. In this case one says that the numbers are relatively prime or coprime.

2.1.1 Alternate Subtractions

Let us describe Euclid’s procedure in general. It is based on two simple observations: (i) ifa = b then the gcd of a and b is b (or a); (ii)dis a common divisor ofis a common divisor ofa -ab and and bb if and only if it, which implies that the gcd ofa - b and b. a and b is the same as the gcd of Now suppose that we wish to determine the gcd ofandb and suppose that a ⩾ b. If a = b then obser-a vation (i) tells us that the gcd istion (ii) tells us that the answer will be the same as it isb.

We can therefore repeat the process: ifa = b1 then the gcd of a andbwe replace1, and hence that ofa by a - ba1 andand reorganize the numbers1 b, is b1, and otherwise1 acomes first.1 - b1 and1 b1 so that if one of them is larger then i(t1)1108 a and 0\le b integersb \le a yes a= b no

0 1 2 Since the iterative procedure just described produces exactly such a strictly decreasing sequence, the iterations must eventually stop, which means that at somepointa and b will be equal, and that value is thus the gcd of$a^{k} and b^{k}$(see figure 1).

2.1.2 Euclidean Divisions

Euclid’s algorithm is usually described in a slightly different way. One makes use of a more complex pro-cedure called Euclidean division—that is, division with remainder—which greatly reduces the number of steps that the algorithm takes. The basic fact underlying this procedure is that ifa and b are two positive integers then there are (unique) integersq and r such thata = bq + r and 0 ⩽ r < b.

The number der. Remarks (i) and (ii) above are then replaced by theq is called the quotient and r is the remain- following ones: (ii(i^ ) if) the gcd ofr . r = 0 then the gcd ofa and b is the same as the gcd ofa and b is equal to bb; and This time, at the first step, one replaces Ifr = 0, then at the second step one replaces(a, b) by(b, r )(b, r )by.

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

(r , rby r1, and so on. The sequence of remainders is strictly), where r1 is the remainder in the division of b decreasing ( b > r > r1 > r2 ⩾ 0), so the process stops and the gcd is the last nonzero remainder. It is not hard to see that the two approaches are equivalent. Suppose, for example, that$b =$37. If you use the first approach, then you will$a = 103 438 and$ repeatedly subtract 37 from 103 438 until you reach a number that is smaller than 37. This number will be the remainder when 103 438 is divided by 37, which is the first number you would calculate if you used the second approach.
Thus, the reason for the second approach is that repeated subtraction can be a very inefficient wayof calculating remainders. This efficiency gain is very important in practice: the second approach gives riseto a polynomial-time algorithm [IV.20 §2](/part-04/computational-complexity), while the time taken by the first is exponentially long. 2.1.3 Generalizations Euclid’s algorithm can be generalized to many other contexts where we have notions of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
For example, there is a variant of it that applies to the ring [III.81 §1](/part - 03/rings - ideals - and - modules) Z[i] of Gaussian integers, that is, numbers of the form$a + bi$, where a and ring of all polynomials with real coefficients (or coeffi - b are ordinary integers. It can also be applied to the cients in any field, for that matter). The one require-ment is that we should be able to find some analogue of the notion of division with remainder, after which the algorithm is virtually identical to the algorithm for positive integers.
For example, we have the following statement for polynomials: given any two polynomials Anomialsand B with Q and B Rnot the zero polynomial, there are poly-such that A = BQ + R and either R = 0 or the degree of As Euclid noticed (R is less than the degree of Elements, Book X, proposition 2), B. one may also carry out the procedure on pairs of num-bersa and b that are not necessarily integers. It is easy to check that the process will stop if and only if the ratio to the concept ofa/b is a rational number. This observation leads continued fractions [III.22], which are discussed in part III.
They were not studied explic-itly before the seventeenth century, but the roots of the idea can be traced back to archimedes [VI.3](/part - 06/archimedes - ca). 2.2 The Method of Archimedes to Calculate Approximation and Finitenessπ: The ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diam-eter is a constant that has been denoted byπ since II.4. Algorithms the eighteenth century (see [[III.70]](/part - 03/)). Let us see how Archimedes, in the third century b.c.e., obtained the classical approximation inscribed polygons (whose vertices lie on the circle) and227 for this ratio.
If one draws circumscribed polygons (whose sides are tangent to the circle) and if one computes the length of these polygons, then one obtains lower and upper bounds forthe value ofπ, since the circumference of the circle is greater than the length of any inscribed polygon and less than the length of any circumscribed polygon (figure 2). Archimedes started with regular hexagons, and then repeatedly doubled the number of sides, obtaining more and more precise bounds. He finished with ninety-six-sided polygons, obtaining the estimates 3$+1071 ⩽ π ⩽ 3 + 1 7$. to call it an algorithm?

His explanation starts with the observation that the root mately equal to 2. He therefore writes x x = is approx i - 2 + p and obtains an equation forp by substituting 2 + p for x in the original equation. This new equation works out tobep3 + 6 p2 + 10 p - 1 = 0. Because x is close to 2, p is 109 TGHADFNEOBC Figure 2 Approximation ofπ. small, so he then estimatesp3 and 6 p2 (since these should be considerably smallerp by for getting the terms than 10 orp= p1. Of course, this is not an exact solution, but it- 1).
This gives him the equation 10 p -1 = 0, provides him with a new and better approximation, 2 forx. He then repeats the process, writing10 x = 2.1 +.q1,, substituting to obtain an equation forq, solving this equation approximately, and refining his estimate still further. The estimate he obtains for$q is - 0$.0054, so the next approximation for How, though, can we be sure that this process really$x is 2$.0946. does converge to$x$? Let us examine the method more closely.

For example, the domains of attraction of the roots±1 of the polynomial z2 - 1 are the open half-planes bounded by the vertical axis, but the domains corresponding to the roots 1,ω, andω2 of z3 - 1 are extremely complicated sets. They were described by Julia in 1918—such subsets are now called fractal sets. Newton’s method and fractal sets are discussed further in dynamics [IV.14](/part - 04/dynamics).
2.3.2 Recurrence Formulas At each stage of his method, Newton had to produce a new equation, but in 1690 Raphson noticed that this was not really necessary. For particular examples, hegave single formulas that could be used at each step, but his basic observation applies in general and leads to a general formula for every case, which one can easily obtain using the interpretation in terms of tangents. Indeed, the tangent to the curve point ofx-coordinate a has the equationy = yf (x)- f (a)at the = fx^ -coordinate(a)(x - a), and it cuts thea - f (a)/f^ (a).

3.1 Hilbert’s Tenth Problem:

The Need for Formalization

In 1900, at the Second International Congress of Math-ematicians, hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) proposed a list of twenty three problems. These problems, and Hilbert’s works in general, had a huge influence on mathematics during the twentieth century (Gray 2000). We are interested here in Hilbert’s tenth problem: given a Diophantine

II.4. Algorithms

equation, that is, a polynomial equation with any num-ber of indeterminates and with integer coefficients, “a process is sought by which it can be determined, in a finite number of operations, whether the equation issolvable in integral numbers.” In other words, we have to find an algorithm which tells us, for any Diophan-tine equation, whether or not it has at least one integer solution. Of course, for many Diophantine equations it is easy to find solutions, or to prove that no solutions exist. However, this is by no means always the case:
consider, for instance, the Fermat equation xn + yn = zn(n ⩾ 3). (Even before the solution of fermat’s last theorem mining for any specific[V.10](/part - 05/fermats - last - theorem) an algorithm was known for deter - n whether this equation had a solution. However, one could not call it easy.)If Hilbert’s tenth problem has a positive answer, then one can demonstrate it by exhibiting a “process” of the sort that Hilbert asked for. To do this, it is not necessary to have a precise understanding of what a “process” is.
However, if you want to give ayou have to show that no algorithm exists negative , and for that answer, then you need to say precisely what counts as an algorithm. In section 1.2 we gave a definition that seems to be reasonably precise, but it is not precise enough to enable us to think about Hilbert’s tenth problem. What kind of rules are we allowed to use in an algorithm? How can we be sure that no algorithm achieves a certain task, rather than just that we are unable to find one? 3.2 Recursive Functions: Church’s Thesis What we need is aalgorithm.
In the seventeenth century, formal definition of the notion of an leibniz [VI.15](/part - 06/gottfried - wilhelm - leibniz - 16461716) envisaged a universal language that would allow one to reduce mathematical proofs to simple computations. Then, during the nineteenth century, logicians suchas Charles Babbage, boole [VI.43](/part - 06/george - boole - 18151864), frege [VI.56](/part - 06/gottlob - frege - 18481925), and peano ing by an “algebraization” of logic.
Finally, between[VI.62](/part - 06/giuseppe - peano - 18581932) tried to formalize mathematical reason1931 and 1936, gödel [VI.92](/part - 06/kurt - gdel - 19061978), church [VI.89](/part - 06/alonzo - church - 19031995), and Stephen Kleene introduced the notion of tions (see Davis (1965), which contains the original recursive func texts). Roughly speaking, a recursive function is one that can be calculated by means of an algorithm, but the definition of recursive functions is different, and is completely precise.
3.2.1 Primitive Recursive Functions Another rough definition of a recursive function is as follows: a recursive function is one that has an induc - 111 tive definition. To give an idea of what this means, let usconsider addition and multiplication as functions from N . imes N to N. To emphasize this, we shall write sum(x, y) and prod(x, y) for x + y and xy, respectively. A familiar fact about multiplication is that it is “repeated addition.” Let us examine this idea more pre-cisely. We can define the function “prod” in terms of the function “sum” by means of the following two rules:
prod(1, y) equals y and prod(x + 1, y) equals sumyou know how to calculate sums, then you can work out(prod(x, y), y). Thus, if you know prod(x, y) and prod$(x + 1$, y). Since you also know the “base case” prod these simple rules completely determine the function$(1, y)$, a simple inductive argument shows that “prod.” sively defined” in terms of another. We now want to understand the class of We have just seen how one function can be “recur-all functions from Nn to N that can be built up in a few basic ways, of which recursionis the most important.
We shall refer to functions from Nn to N as n-ary functions. out of which the rest will be built. It turns out that a To begin with, we need an initial stock of functions very simple set of functions is enough. Most basic arethe constant functions: that is, functions that take every n-tuple in Nnto some fixed positive integerc. Another very simple function, but the function that allows usto create much more interesting ones, is the success or function one, n +, which takes a positive integer1. Finally, we have projection functionsn to the next:
the function maps it to the(Uk)n takes a sequence kth coordinate x(x.1, . . . , xn) in Nn and from other functions. The first ism We then have two ways of constructing functions-ary function φ and m n-ary functionsk substitutionψ. Given an, . . . , ψ , 1 m one defines ann-ary function by(x1, . . . , xn) \to φ(ψ1(x1, . . . , xn), $. . . , ψm(x1, . . . , xn))$. For example, so we can obtain the function(x + y)2 = prod(sum(x, y)(x, y)$,\to sum(x(x$, y))+ y)2, from the functions “sum” and “prod” by means of substitution. tive recursion The second method of construction is called.
This is a more general form of the induc-primitive method we used above in order to construct the function “prod” from the function “sum.” Given an (n - 1)-ary function ψ and an (n + 1)-ary function μ, one defines ann-ary function φ by saying thatφ(1, x2, $. . . , xn) = ψ(x2$, $. . . , xn) 112 and φ(k + 1, x2$, . . . , xn)= \mu(k, φ(k, x2, . . . , xn), x2, . . . , xn).

3.2.2 Recursive Functions

If you think for a while about primitive recursion and know a small amount about programming computers, you should be able to convince your self that they are effectively computable: that is, that for any primitive recursive function there is an algorithm for computingit. (For example, the operation of primitive recursion can usually be realized in a rather direct way as a FOR loop.)How about the converse? Are all computable functions primitive recursive? Consider, for example, the function that takes the positive integern to p , then algorithm for computingth prime number.
It is not hard to devise a simplep , and it is then a good exer-^n cise (if you want to understand primitive recursion) to convert this algorithm into a proof that the function is$n$ primitive recursive. However, it turns out that this function is not typical: there are computable functions that are not primitive recursive. In 1928, Wilhelm Ackermann defined a function, now known as the“doubly inductive” definition. The following function is Ackermann function, that has a not quite the same as Ackermann’s, but it is very simi-lar.
It is the function A(x, y) that is determined by the following recurrence rules: (iii)(ii)(i)A(A(x$, A(xand1, y)+y >11)$, y==1.+2 for everyy1+) 2 for every= A(x, A(xx;$y+$;1$, y)) whenever x > 1$ For example, From this and the fact that A(2, y +1) = A(A(1, A(2, 1)2, y))= 2 it follows that= A(2, y)+ 2.A(show that2, y) =A(2 y3, y)for every= 2 y, and in general that for eachy. In a similar way one canx

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

the function that takes$y to A(x + 1$, y)“iterates” the function that takes values of A(x, y) are extremely large even wheny to A(x, y). This means that thex andy are fairly small. For example$, A(4, y + 1) = 2 A(4 , y)$, so in general of height$y$. We have A(4, y)is given by an “exponential tower”A(4, 1) = 2, A(4, 2) = 22 = 4, A(A(44,,35)) == 2265 5364 =, which is too large a number for its16, A(4, 4) = 216 = 65 536, and decimal notation to be reproduced here. It can be shown that for every primitive recursive functionφ there is some x such that the function A(x, y)inductive argument.
To oversimplify slightly, if grows faster than φ(y). This is proved by anψ(y) andthanμ(y)A(x, y)have already been shown to grow more slowly, then one can show that the functionφgrows more slowly. This allows us to define a “diag-produced from them by primitive recursion also onal” function A(y) = A(y, y) that is not primi- tive recursive because it grows faster than any of the functions A(x, y).
functions can be calculated algorithmically, then our definition will surely have to encompass functions like If we are trying to understand in a precise way which the Ackermann function, since they can in principle becomputed. Therefore, we must consider a larger class of functions than just the primitive recursive ones. This is what Gödel, Church, and Kleene did, and they obtained in different ways the same class offunctions. For instance, Kleene added a third method ofrecursive construction, which he called$(n + 1)$-ary function, one defines an min im iz at io nn-ary function.

(If there is no suchn) to be the smallesty, one regard sy such that gc om pl ic at i on in what follows.)as undefined for1 n (x1, $. . . , x^{n})$. We shall ignore this recursive, but so are all functions that one can writea computer program to calculate. So this gives us the It turns out that, not only is the Ackermann function formal definition of computability that we did not have before.

3.2.3 Effective Calculability

Once the notion of recursive functions had been formulated, Church claimed that the class of recursive func-tions was exactly the same as the class of “effectively calculable” functions. This claim is widely believed, but it is a conviction that cannot be proved since the notion of recursive function is a mathematically precise concept while that of an effectively calculable function is an intuitive notion, rather like that of

II.4. Algorithms

“algorithm.” Church’s statement lies in the realm of metamathematics and is now called Church’s thesis.

3.3 Turing Machines

One of the strongest pieces of evidence for Church’sthesis is that in 1936 turing [VI.94](/part-06/alan-turing-19121954) found a very different-looking way of formalizing the notion of analgorithm, which he showed was equivalent. That is, every function that was computable in his new sense was recursive and vice versa. His approach was to define a notion that is now called awhich can be thought of as an extremely primitive com-Turing machine, puter, and which played an important part in the devel-opment of actual computers.
Indeed, functions that are computable by Turing machines are precisely those that can be programmed on a computer. The primitive architecture of Turing machines does not make them any less powerful: it merely means that in practice they would be too cumbersome to program or toimplement in hardware.
Since recursive functions are the same as Turing-computable functions, it follows that recursive functions too are those functions that can be programmed on a computer, so to disbelieve Church’s thesis would be to maintain that there are some “effective procedures” that cannot be converted into computer programs—which seems rather implausible. A description of Turing machines can be found in Turing introduced his machines in response to a computational complexity [IV.20 §1](/part-04/computational-complexity). question that generalized Hilbert’s tenth problem.
The entscheidungspr oblem asked by Hilbert, in 1922. He wanted to know whether, or decision problem, was also there was a “mechanical process” by which one could determine whether any given mathematical statement could be proved. In order to think about this, turing needed a precise notion of what constituted a “mechanical process.” Once he had defined Turing machines, he was able to show by means of a fairly straightforward diagonal argument that the answer to Hilbert’squestion was no.
His argument is outlined in the insolubility of the halting problem [V.20](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-halting-problem). 4 Properties of Algorithms 4.1 Iteration versus Recursion As previously mentioned, we often encounter compu-tation rules which define each element of a sequence in terms of the preceding elements. This gives rise totwo different ways of carrying out the computation. 113 The first isone obtains succeeding terms by means of a recurrence iteration: one computes the first terms, then formula.
The second is recursion, a procedure which seems circular at first because one defines a procedurein terms of itself. However, this is allowed because the procedure calls on itself with smaller values of the variables. The concept of recursion is subtle and powerful. Let us try to clarify the difference between recursion and iteration with some examples. Suppose that we wish to compute n!$= 1 · 2 ·$ 3 the recurrence relation· · · (n - 1) · n. An obvious way of doing it is to noten!$= n · (n - 1)$! and the initial value 1!= 1.
Having done so, one could then compute successively the numbers 2!, 3!, 4!, and soon until one reached$n$!, which would be the iterative approach. Alternatively, one could say that if fact the result of a procedure that leads to$n$!, then fact$(n)(n) is = n \t\text{imes fact}(n - 1)$, which would be a recursive procedure. The second approach says that to obtain know how to obtain$(n - 1)$!, and to obt a inn(n! it suffices to-1)! it suffices to know how to obtain knows that 1!$= 1$, one can obtain(n - 2)!, and so on. Since one$n$!.
Thus, recursion is a bit like iteration but thought of “backwards.” clearly the difference between the two procedures. In some ways this example is too simple to show More over, if one wishes to compute seems simpler and more natural than recursion. We n!, then iteration now look at an example where recursion is far simpler than iteration.

4.1.1 The Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a problem that goes back toÉdouard Lucas in 1884. One is givenn disks, all of dif- ferent sizes and each with a hole in the middle, stacked on a peg A in order of size, with the largest one at the bottom. We also have two empty pegs B and C. The problem is to move the stack from peg A to peg B while obeying the following rules. One is allowed to move just one disk at a time, and each move consists in taking the top disk from one of the pegs and putting it onto another peg. In addition, no disk may ever be placed above a smaller disk.
but becomes rapidly harder as the number of disks The problem is easy if you have just three disks, increases. However, with the help of recursion one cansee very quickly that an algorithm exists for moving the disks in the required way. Indeed, suppose that weknow a procedure H(n -1) that solves the problem forn - 1 disks. Here is a procedure H(n) for ndisks: move 114 the first H(n - 1)n, then move the last disk on A to B, and finally- 1 disks on top of A to C with the procedure apply once more the procedure H(n - 1) to move all the disks from C to B.
If we write that movesn disks from peg A to peg B according to the HAB(n) for the procedure rules, then we can represent this recursion symbolically as HAB(n) = HAC(n - 1)HAB(1)HBC(n - 1)$. Thus,1$), which are clearly equivalent to HAB(n) is deduced from HAC(n H-1(n) and- 1 H). Since BC(n -HABOne can easily check by induction that this proce-(1) is certainly easy, we have the full recursion. ABdure takes 2 n - 1 moves—more over, it turns out that the task cannot be accomplished in fewer moves.
Thus, the number of moves is an exponential function ofn, so for large Further more, the large rn the procedure will be very long.n is, the more memory one must use to keep track of where one is in the procedure. By contrast, if we wish to carry out an iteration during an iterative procedure, it is usually enough to know just the result of the previous iteration. Thus, the most we need to remember is the result of one iteration. There is in fact an iterative procedure for the Tower of Hanoi as well. It is easy to describe, but it is much less obvious that it actually solves the problem.
It encodes the positions of the step applies a very simple rule to obtain the nextn disks as an n-bit sequence and at eachn-bit sequence. This rule makes no reference to how many steps have so far taken place, and therefore the amount of memory needed, beyond that required to store the positions of the disks, is very small. 4.1.2 The Extended Euclid Algorithm Euclid’s algorithm is another example that lends itself in a very natural way to a recursive procedure. Recall that ifcan writea anda =bqbare two positive integers, then we + r with 0 ⩽ r < b.
The algo- rithm depended on the observation that gcd(a$, b) =$ gcdily from(b, r )a. Since the remainder and b, and since the pairr can be calculated eas-(b, r ) is smaller than the pair which stops when we reach a pair of the form(a, b), this gives us a recursive procedure,(a, 0). An important extension of Euclid’s algorithm is Bézout’s lemma tive integers(a, b), which states that for any pair of posi-there exist (not necessarily positive) integer su and v such thatua + vb = d = gcd(a, b). How can we obtain such integersis given by the extended Euclid algorithmu and v, which again?
The answer II.
 The Origins of Modern Mathematics can be defined using recursion. Suppose we can find apair(u^ , v^ ) that works for b and r: that is, u^ b + v^ r =dthis equation and deduce that. Since a = qb + r , we can substituted = u^ br+=v^ a(a--qbqb)into = v^ a+(u^ -v^ q)b. Thus, setting u = v^ and v = u^ -v^ q, we have for a anduab can be easily calculated from a pair + vb = d. Since a pair (u, v) that works(u^ , v^ ) that works for the smallersive procedure. The “bottom” of the recursion is whenb and r , this gives us a recur - r = 0, in which case we know that 1 b + 0 r = d.
Once we reach this, we can “run back up” through Euclid’s algo - rithm, successively modifying our pair(u, v) according to the rule just given. Notice, incidentally, that the fact that this procedure exists is a proof of Bézout’s lemma. 4.2 Complexity So far we have considered algorithms in a theoretical way and ignored their obvious practical importance. However, the mere existence of an algorithm for carrying out a certain task does not guarantee that your computer can do it, because some algorithms take so many steps that no computer can implement them (unless you are prepared to wait
billions of years forthe answer). The complexity of an algorithm is, loosely speaking, the number of steps it takes to complete its task (as a function of the size of the input). more precisely, this is the time complexity of the algorithm. There is also its maximum amount of memory a computer needs in space complexity, which measures the order to implement it. Complexity theory is the study of the computational resources that are needed to carry out various tasks.
It is discussed in detail in computational complexity [IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity)—here we shall give a hint of it by examining the complexity of one algorithm.

4.2.1 The Complexity of Euclid’s Algorithm

The length of time that a computer will take to imple-ment Euclid’s algorithm is closely related to the number of times one needs to compute quotients and remain-ders: that is, to the number of times that the recursive procedure calls on itself. Of course, this number depends in turn on the size of the numbers whose gcd is to be determined. An initial observation a and b is that if 0< b ⩽ a, then the remainder in the divi- sion ofifb ⩾ aa/by2 then the remainder isb is less than a/2.
To see this, notice thata - b, which is at mosta/2, where as if b ⩽ a/2 then we know that the remainder is at mostb and so is again at most a/2. It

II.4. Algorithms

follows that after two steps of calculating the remain-der, one arrives at a pair where the larger number is at most half what it was before. From this it is easy to show that the number of such calculations needed is atmost 2 loga + 1, which is roughly proportional to the number of digits ofthana itself, the algorithm can be used easily for very2 a. Since this number is far smaller large numbers, which gives it great practical utility togo with its theoretical significance. does not appear to have been studied until the first halfof the nineteenth century:
the above bound of 2 log The number of divisions needed in the worst casea+ 1 was given by Pierre-Joseph-Étienne Finck in 1841. Itis in fact not hard to improve this result slightly and2 prove that the algorithm takes longest when consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
This implies that thea and b are number of divisions needed is never more than log1, whereφ is the golden ratio$.^{φ} a+$ once one has replaced a pair Euclid’s algorithm also has low space complexity:(a, b) by a new pair (b, r ), one can forget the original pair, so at any stage one does not have to hold very much in one’s memory (or store it in the memory of one’s computer).
By contrast, the extended Euclid algorithm appears to require one to remember the entire sequence of calculations that leads to the gcdd of a and b, so that one can make a series of substitutions and eventually find such thatua + vb = d. However, a closer look at itu and v reveals that one can perform it while keeping track of only a few numbers at any one time. Let us see how this works with an example. We shall set38 ua+=2138$, v = b$1. We begin by writing down the first step$=$21, and find integer su and v such that of Euclid’s algorithm: 38$= 1 \times 21 + 17$.
This tells us that 17 = 38 - 21.
Now we write down the second step: 21$= 1 \times 17 + 4$. We know how to write 17 in terms of 38 and 21, so letus do a substitution: 21$= 1 \times (38 - 21) + 4$. Rearranging this, we discover that 4= 2 . imes 21 - 38. Now we write down the third step of Euclid’s algorithm: 17$= 4 \times 4 + 1$. We know how to write 17 and 4 in terms of 38 and 21, so let us substitute again: 38$- 21 = 4 \times (2 \times 21 - 38) + 1$.

115

Rearranging this, we find that 1$= 5 \times 38 - 9 \times 21$, and we have finished. at each stage one just has to keep track of how two numbers are expressed in terms of If you think about this procedure, you will see thata and b. Thus, the space complexity of the extended Euclid algorithm is small if you implement it properly. 5 Modern Aspects of Algorithms

5.1 Algorithms and Chance

Earlier it was remarked that the notion of algorithm has continued to develop even since its formalization in the 1920 s and 1930 s. One of the main reasons for this has been the realization thata very useful tool in algorithms. This may seem puz-randomness can be zling at first, since algorithms as we have described them are deterministic procedures; in a moment we shall give an example that illustrates how randomness can be used. A second reason is the recent development of the notion of a quantum algorithm: for more about this, see quantum computation [III.74](/part-03/quantum-computation).
 can be useful. Given an integer tion The following simple example illustrates how chancef (n)that is not too hard to calculate but is diffi-n, we shall define a func cult to analyze. If. qrt{n}to the point where the firstn has d digits, then you approximated digits after the dec- imal point are correct (using Newton’s method, say), and letf (n) equal the dth digit. Now suppose that you wish to know roughly what proportion of numbers between 1030 and 1031 have$f (n) = 0$.
There does notn seem to be a good way of determining this theoretically, but calculating it on a computer looks very hard, too, as there are so many numbers between 1030 and 1031. However, if one chooses a random sample of 10 000 numbers between 1030 and 1031 and does the calculation for just those numbers, then with high probability the proportion of those numbers with$f (n) = 0 \text{will be}$roughly the same as the proportion of all numbers inthe range withf (n) = 0.
Thus, if you do not demand absolute certainty but instead are satisfied with a very small error probability, then you can achieve your goal with much more modest computational resources. 5.1.1 Pseudorandom Numbers How, though, does one use a deterministic computer to select ten thousand random numbers between 1030 and 1031? The answer is that one does not in fact need to: it is almost always good enough to make a pseudorandom 116 selection instead. The basic idea is well-illustrated bya method proposed by von neumann [VI.91](/part - 06/john - von - neumann - 19031957) in the mid 1940 s.
One begins with a 2 the “seed,” calculates a2, and extracts fromn-digit integeraa2, called a new2 n-digit number b by taking all the digits of a2 from the(n + 1)st to the 3 nth. One then repeats the pro- cedure for pl ic at i on jumbles up digits, the resulting sequence ofb, and so on. Because of the way multi - 2 truly random sequence, and can be used in randomizedn-digit numbers is very hard to distinguish from a algorithms. There are many other ways of producing pseudorandom sequences, and this raises an obvious question:
what properties should a sequence have for usto regard it as pseudorandom? This turns out to be a complex question, and several different answers have been proposed. Randomized algorithms and pseudo randomness are discussed in depth in computational complexity“pseudorandom generators” can be found there.
(See [[IV.20 §§6, 7]](/part - 04/computational - complexity), and a formal definition of also account of a famous randomized algorithm for testing computational number theory [IV.3 §2](/part - 04/computational - number - theory) for an whether a number is prime.) Here, let us discuss a similar question about infinite sequences of zeros and ones. When should we regard such a sequence as “random”? One idea is to consider simple statistical tests: we would expect that in the long run the frequency of zeros Again, many different answers have been suggested.
should be roughly the same as that of ones, and more generally that any small subsequence such as 00110 should appear with the “right” frequency (which for this sequence would be 1 since it has length 5). It is perfectly possible, however, for a sequence to32 pass these simple tests but to be generated by a deter-ministic procedure. If one is trying to decide whether a sequence of zeros and ones isthat is, produced by some means such as tossing a actually random— coin—then we will be very suspicious of a sequence if we can identify an algorithm that produces the same sequence.
For example, we would reject a sequence that was derived in a simple way from the digits ofif it passed the statistical tests. However, merely to askπ, even that a sequence cannot be produced by a recursive procedure does not give a good test for randomness: for example, if one takes any such sequence and alternates the terms of that sequence with zeros, one then obtains a new sequence that is far from random, but which still cannot be produced recursively. sequence of zeros and ones should be called random if For this reason, von Mises suggested in 1919 that a II.
The Origins of Modern Mathematics it is not only the case that the limit of the frequency ofones is 1, but also that the same is true for any subsequence that can be extracted “by means of a reasonable procedure.” In 1940 Church made this more precise by2 translating “by means of a reasonable procedure” into “by means of a recursive function.” However, even this condition is too weak: there are such sequences that do not satisfy the “law of the iterated logarithm” (some-thing that a random sequence would satisfy).
Currently, the so-called Martin–Löf thesis, formulated in 1966, is one of the most commonly used definitions of random - ness: a random sequence is a sequence that satisfies all the “effective statistical sequential tests,” a notion that we cannot formulate precisely here, but which uses inan essential manner the notion of recursive function. By contrast with Church’s thesis, with which almost every mathematician agrees, the Martin–Löf thesis is still very much under discussion.
5.2 The Influence of Algorithms on Contemporary Mathematics Through out its history, mathematics has concerned itself with problems of existence. For example, are there transcendental numbers [III.41](/part - 03/irrational - and-\text{transcendental} - numbers), that is, numbers that are not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients? There are two kinds of answers to such questions:
either one actually exhibits a number such asby Carl Lindemann in 1873), or one gives an “indirectπ and proves that it is transcendental (this was done existence proof,” such as cantor’s [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918) demonstration that there are “far more” real numbers than there are roots of polynomials with integer coefficients (see countable and uncountable sets [III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets)), which shows in particular that some real numbers must be transcendental.
5.2.1 Constructivist Schools In around 1910, under the leadership of[VI.75](/part - 06/luitzen - egbertus - jan - brouwer - 18811966), the intuitionist school [II.7 §3.1](/part - 02/foundations - crisis) of mathe - l. e. j. brouwer matics arose, which rejected the principle of the ex-cluded middle, the principle that every mathematical assertion is either true or false. In particular, Brouwer did not accept that the existence of a mathematical object such as a transcendental number is proved by the fact that its nonexistence would lead to a contra - diction.
This was the first of several “constructivist” schools, for which an object exists if and only if it can be constructed explicitly. II.5. The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis to these principles, but almost all would agree that Not many working mathematicians have subscribed there is an important difference between constructive proofs and in direct proofs of existence, a difference that has come to seem more important with the riseof computer science. This has added a further level of refinement:
some times, even if you know that a math-ematical object can be produced algorithmically, you still care whether the algorithm can be made to work in a reasonably short time. 5.2.2 Effective Results In number theory there is an important distinction between “effective” and “ineffective” results. For example, and finally proved by Faltings in 1983, states that a mordell’s conjecture [V.29](/part - 05/rational - points - on - curves - and - vi40 - ernst - eduard - kummer - 18101893), proposed in 1922 smooth rational plane curve of degree most finitely many points with rational coefficients.
n > 3 has at Among its many consequences is that the Fermat equa-tionxn + yn = znhas only finitely many integral solutions for eachn ⩾ 4. (Of course, we now know that it has no nontrivial solutions, but the Mordell conjecture was proved before Fermat’s last theorem, and it has many other consequences.) However, Faltings’s proof is in effective ma tion about how many solutions there are (except that, which means that it does not give any inforthere are not infinitely many), or how large they can be, so one cannot use a computer to find them all and know that one has finished the job.
There are many other very important proofs in number theory that are ineffective, and replacing any one of them with an effective argument would be a major breakthrough. A completely different set of issues was raised by another solution to a famous open problem, the color theorem [V.12](/part-05/the-four-color-theorem), which was conjectured by Fran-four cis Guthrie, a student ofand proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken, with a proof de morgan [VI.38], in 1852 that made essential use of computers.
They began witha theoretical argument that reduced the problem to checking finitely many cases, but the number of cases was so large that it could not be done by hand and was instead done by computers. But how should we judge such a proof? Can we be sure that the computer has been programmed correctly? And even if it has, how do we know with a computation of that size that the computer has operated correctly? And does a proof that relies on a computer really tell usrem is true? These questions continue to be debated why the the oto day.

1 Background

This article is about how rigor came to be introduced into mathematical analysis. This is a complicated topic, since mathematical practice has changed considerably, especially in the period between the founding of the cal-culus (shortly before 1700) and the early twentieth century. In a sense, the basic criteria for what constitutes a correct and logical argument have not altered, but the circumstances under which one would require such anargument, and even to some degree the purpose of the argument, have altered with time.
The voluminous and successful mathematical analysis of the 1700 s, associated with names such as Johann and Daniel[VI.18](/part-06/the-bernoullis-), euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783), and lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), lacked bernoulli foundational clarity in ways that were criticized and remedied in subsequent periods. By around 1910 a general consensus had emerged about how to make arguments in analysis rigorous.
calculation, methods for describing important features Mathematics consists of more than techniques for of geometric objects, and models of worldly phenom-ena. Nowadays, almost all working mathematicians are trained in, and concerned with, the production of rig-orous arguments that justify their conclusions. These conclusions are usually framed as statements of fact, accompanied by an argument, ortheorems, which are proof, that the theorem is indeed true. Here is a simple example: every positive whole number that is divisible

118

by 6 is also divisible by 2. Running through the six times table (6, 12, 18, 24, ...) we see that each number is even, which makes the statement easy enough to believe. A possible justification of it would be to say that since 6 is divisible by 2, then every number divisible by 6 must also be divisible by 2.Such a justification might or might not be thought of as a thorough proof, depending on the reader. For on hearing the justification we can raise questions: is it always true that ifa, b, and c are three positive whole numbers such that ble bya, then c is divisible byc is divisible bya?
What is div is i bi li tyb and b is divisi- exactly? What is a whole number? The mathematician deals with such questions by precisely defining con-cepts (such as divisibility of one number by another), basing the definitions on a smallish number of unde-fined terms (“whole number” might be one, though it is possible to start even further back, with sets). For example, one could define a number by a num berm if and only if there exists an integern to be divisibleq such that more precise proof: if$qm = n$.
Using this definition, we can give an is divisible by 6, then n = 6 q for some$q$, and therefore n = 2(3 q), which proves that nto show that the definition of divisibility by 2 holds is divisible by 2. Thus we have used the definitions whenever the definition of divisibility by 6 holds. Historically, mathematical writers have been satisfied with varying levels of rigor.
Results and methods have often been widely used with out a full justification of the kind just outlined, particularly in bodies of mathematical thought that are new and rapidly developing. Some ancient cultures, the Egyptians for example, had methods for multiplication and division, but no justification of these methods has survived and it does not seem especially likely that formal justification existed. The methods were probably accepted simply because they worked, rather than because there was a thorough argument justifying them.
mathematical writers who were engaged in research were well-acquainted with the model of rigorous math-By the middle of the seventeenth century, European ematical argument supplied by ments. The kind of deductive, or synthetic, argument euclid’s [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) Elewe illustrated earlier would have been described as aproof more geometrico—in the geometrical way. While Euclid’s arguments, assumptions, and definitions arenot wholly rigorous by today’s standards, the basic idea was clear:
one proceeds from clear definitions and generally agreed basic ideas (such as that the whole is greater than the part) to deduce theorems (also called

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

propositions) in a step-by-step manner, not bringingin anything extra (either on the sly or unintentionally). This classical model of geometric argument was widely used in reasoning about whole numbers (for example by[VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650)), and in mechanics (Galileo).fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665)), in analytic geometry (descartes itself has had a shifting meaning.
Coming from ancient origins, by around 1600 the term was used to refer to This article is about rigor in analysis, a term which mathematics in which one worked with an unknown(something we would now write asx) to do a calculation or find a length. In other words, it was closely related to algebra, though the notion was imported into geometry by Descartes and others. However, over the course of the eighteenth century the word came to be associated with the calculus, which was the principal area of application of analytic techniques.
When we talk about rigor in analysis it is the rigorous theory of the mathematics associated with differential and integral calculus that we are principally discussing. In the third quarter ofthe seventeenth century rival methods for the differential and integral calculus were devised by[VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) and leibniz [VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716), who there by synthesized newton and extended a considerable amount of earlier work concerned with tangents and normals to curves and with the areas of regions bounded by curves.
The techniques were highly successful, and were extended read-ily in a variety of directions, most notably in mechanics and in differential equations. The key common feature of this research was the use of infinities: in some sense, it involved devising meth-ods for combining infinitely many infinitely small quantities to get a finite answer. For example, suppose we divide the circumference of a circle into a (large) num-ber of equal parts by marking off points at equal distances, then joining the points and creating triangles by joining the points to the center.
Adding up the areas of the triangles approximates the circular area, and the more points we use the better the approximation. Ifwe imagine infinitely many of these inscribed triangles, the area of each will be “infinitely small” ormal. But because the total involves adding up infinitely infinite simany of them, it may be that we get a finite positive total (rather than just 0, from adding up infinitely many zeros, or an infinite number, as we would get if we added the same finite number to itself infinitely many times).
Many techniques for doing such calculations were devised, though the interpretation of what was taking place varied. Were the infinities involved“real” or merely “potential”? If something is “really”

II.5. The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis infinitesimal, is it just zero? Aristotelian writers had abhorred actual infinities, and complaints about them were common at the time. Newton, Leibniz, and their immediate followers provided mathematical arguments to justify these methods.
However, the introduction of techniques involv-ing reasoning with infinitely small objects, limiting processes, infinite sums, and so forth meant that the founders of the calculus were exploring new ground in their arguments, and the comprehensibili ty of these arguments was frequently compromised by vague terminology or by the drawing of one conclusion when another might seem to follow equally well.
The objects they were discussing included infinitesimals (quantities infinitely smaller than those we experience directly), ratios of vanishingly small quantities (i.e., fractionsin, or approaching, the form 0/0), and finite sums of infinitely many positive terms. Taylor series re pre sen-tat i ons, in particular, provoked a variety of questions.
A function may be written as a series in such a way that the series, when viewed as a function, will have, at a given pointx = a, the same value as the function, the same rate of change (or first derivative), and the same higher-order derivatives to arbitrary order: f (x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a) + {}12 f (a)(x - a)2 + · · ·. For example, sin$x = x - x^{3}/$3!$+ x^{5}/$5!$+ · · ·$, a fact already known to Newton though such series are now named after Newton’s disciple brook taylor [VI.16](/part-06/brook-taylor-16851731).
One problem with early arguments was that the terms being discussed were used in different ways bydifferent writers. Other problems arose from this lack of clarity, since it concealed a variety of issues. Per-haps the most important of these was that an argument could fail to work in one context, even though a very similar argument worked perfectly well in another.
In time, this led to serious problems in extending analysis. Eventually, analysis became fully rigorous and these difficulties were solved, but the process was a long one and it was complete only by the beginning of the twentieth century. ficul ties that arose from the very beginning, using a result of Leibniz. Suppose we have two variables, Let us consider some examples of the kinds of dif-$u$ and$x$, changes. An infinitesimal change inv, each of which changes when another variable, x is denoted dx, the differential ofquantity, thought of as a geometrical magnitude, such$x$.
The differential is an infinitesimal as a length, for example. This was imagined to be com-bined or compared with other magnitudes in the usual

119

ways (two lengths can be added, have a ratio, and so on).Whenx changes to x + dx, u and v change to u + du$and$ v + dv , respectively. Leibniz concluded that the product so that duv(uv)would then change to = u dv + v du. His argument is, roughly, uv + u dv + v du, that d(uv) = (u + du)(v + dv) - uv. Expanding the right-hand side using regular algebra and then simpli-fying givesu dv + v du + du dv. But the term dudv is a second-order infinitesimal, vanishingly small compared with the first-order differentials, and is thus treated as equal to 0.
Indeed, one aspect of the problems is that there appears to be anway that infinitesimals are treated. For instance, if you in consistency in the want to work out the derivative of y = x2, the calcu- lation corresponding to the one just given (expanding$(x + dx)2$, and so on) shows that dy/dx = 2 x+dx. We then treat the dthe one on the left-hand side seems as though it oughtx on the right-hand side as zero, but to be an infinitesimal we could not divide by it. So is it zero or not?
And if not, nonzero quantity, since otherwise how do we get around the apparent in consistency?At a slightly more technical level, the calculus required mathematicians to deal repeatedly with the“ultimate” values of ratios of the form dy/dx when the quantities in both numerator and denominator approach or actually reach 0. This phrasing uses, once again, the differential notation of Leibniz, though the same issues arose for Newton with a slightly different notational and conceptual approach.
Newton generally spoke of variables as depending on time, and he sought(for example) the values approached when “evanescent increments”—vanishingly small time intervals— are considered. One long-standing set of confusions arose precisely from this idea that variable quantities were in the process of changing, whether with timeor with changes in the value of another variable. This means that we talk about values of a variable approach-ing a given value, but with out a clear idea of what this “approach” actually is.
2 Eighteenth-Century approaches and Critiques Of course, had the calculus not turned out to be an enormously fruitful field of endeavor, no one would have bothered to criticize it. But the methods of New-ton and Leibniz were widely adopted for the solution of problems that had interested earlier generations (notably tangent and area problems) and for the posing and solution of problems that these techniques suddenly

120

made far more accessible. Problems of areas, maxima and minima, the formulation and solution of differential equations to describe the shape of hanging chains or the positions of points on vibrating strings, applications to celestial mechanics, the investigation of prob-lems having to do with the properties of functions (thought of for the most part as analytic expressions involving variable quantities)—all these fields and more were developed over the course of the eighteenth cen-tury by mathematicians such as Taylor, Johann and Daniel Bernoulli, Euler, and many others.
These people employed many vir-d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783), Lagrange, tuoso arguments of suspect validity. Operations with divergent series, the use of imaginary numbers, and manipulations involving actual infinities were used effectively in the hands of the most capable of these writers. However, the methods could not always be explained to the less capable, and thus certain results were not reliably reproducible—a very odd state for mathematics from today’s standpoint. To do Euler’sc al cu la tions, one needed to be Euler.
This was a situation that persisted well into the following century. Specific controversies often highlighted issues that we now see as a result of foundational confusion. In the case of infinite series, for example, there was confusion about the domain of validity of formal expressions. Consider the series 1- 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 − · · ·. In today’s usual elementary definition (due to[VI.29](/part - 06/augustin - louis - cauchy - 17891857) around 1820) we would now consider this series cauchy to be divergent because the sequence of partial sums1, 0, 1, 0, . . . does not tend to a limit.
But in fact there was some controversy about the actual meaning of such expressions. Euler and Nicolaus Bernoulli, for example, discussed the potential distinction between theand the value of an infinite sum, Bernoulli arguing that sum something like 1 - 2 + 6 - 24 + 120+· · · has no sum but that this algebraic expression does constitute a value. Whatever may have been meant by this, Euler defended the notion that the sum of the series is the value of the finite expression that gives rise to the series.
Inhis 1755 Institutiones Calculi differential is, he gives the example of 1$- x + x2 - x3 + · · ·$, which comes from$1 that 1/(1 +-x)1$, and later defended the view that this meant + 1 - 1 + · · · =1. His view was not uni- versa lly accepted. Similar controversies arose in con-side ring how to extend the values of functions outside2 their usual domain, for example with the logarithms ofnegative numbers. II.
The Origins of Modern Mathematics tique of the language and methods of eighteenth - cen-tury analysis is due to the philosopher George Berke-Probably the most famous eighteenth-century criley (1685–1753). Berkeley’s motto, “To be is to beperceived,” expresses his idealist stance, which was coupled with a strong view that the abstraction of individual qualities, for the purposes of philosophical discussion, is impossible. The objects of philos-ophy should thus be things that are perceived, and perceived in their entirety.
The impossibility of per-ceiving infinitesimally small objects, combined with their manifestly abstracted nature, led him to attack their use in his 1734 treatise course Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician The Analyst: Or, a Dis-. Referring sarcastically in 1734 to infinitesimals as the “ghosts of departed quantities,” Berkeley argued that neglecting some quantity, no matter how small, was inap-propriate in mathematical argument.
He quoted Newton in this regard, to the effect that “in mathematical matters, errors are to be condemned, no matter how small.” Berkeley continued, saying that “[n]othing butthe obscurity of the subject” could have induced Newton to impose this kind of reasoning on his follow-ers. Such remarks, while they apparently did not dissuade those enamored of the methods, contributed to asentiment that aspects of the calculus required deeper explanation.
Writers such as Euler, d’Alembert, Lazare Carnot, and others attempted to address foundational criticisms by clarifying what differentials were, and gave a variety of arguments to justify the operations of the calculus.

2.1 Euler

Euler contributed to the general development of analy-sis more than any other individual in the eighteenth century, and his approaches to justifying his arguments were enormously influential even after his death, owing to the success and wide use of his important textbooks. Euler’s reasoning is some times regarded as rather care-less since he operated rather freely with the notation of the calculus, and many of his arguments are certainly deficient by later standards. This is particularly true of arguments involving infinite series and products.
Atypical example is provided by an early version of his proof that

$\infty 1 = π^{2}$.n2 6

His method is as follows. Using the known series ex-pansion for sinx he considered the zeros ofn=1. in . qrt. qrt{xx} = 1 -3!$x + x$5!2- x7!3$+ · · ·$.

II.5. The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis These lie atπ2, (2π)2, (3π)2, . . .. Applying (with- out argument) the factor theorem for finite algebraic equations he expressed this equation as$\sqrt{} \sin \sqrt{xx} = 1 - πx^{2} 1 - 4xπ^{2} 1 - 9xπ^{2} · · ·$.$Now$, it can be seen that the coefficient ofnite sum,$- {}^{1}$, should equal the negative of the sumxin the infiof the coefficients ofently concluded this by imagining multiplying out the6 x in the product.

and multiplying both sides byπ2 gives the required sum. problems. The product of the infinitely many terms We now think of this approach as having several may or may not represent a finite value, and today we would specify conditions for when it does. Also, applying a result about (finite) polynomials to (infi-nite) power series is a step that requires justification. Euler himself was to provide alternative arguments for this result later in his life. But the fact that hemay have known counterexamples—situations in which such usages would not work—was not, for him, a decisive obstacle.
This view, in which one reasoned in a generic situation that might admit a few exceptions, was common at his time, and it was only in the late nineteenth century that a concerted effort was made to state the results of analysis in ways that set out precisely the conditions under which the theorems would hold. sums or infinitesimals. Some times he was happy to Euler did not dwell on the interpretation of infinite regard differentials as actually equal to zero, and to derive the meaning of a ratio of differentials from the context of the problem:
An infinitely small quantity is nothing but a vanish-ing quantity and therefore will be actually equal to

0. . . . Hence there are not so many mysteries hidden inthis concept as there are usually believed to be. These supposed mysteries have rendered the calculus of the infinitely small quite suspect to many people. This statement, from the Institutiones Calculi differential is tions in which one of the ratios is 0 of 1755, was followed by a discussion of propor-$/$0, and a justification of the fact that differentials may be neglectedin calculations with ordinary numbers. This accurately

describes a good deal of his practice—when he worked with differential equations, for example. Controversial matters did arise, however, and debates about definitions were not unusual. The best-known example involves discussions connected with the so-called vibrating string problem, which involved Euler, d’Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli. These were closely connected with the definition of functions [I.2 §2.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar), and the question of which functions studied by analysis actually could be represented by series (in particular trigonometric series).
The idea that a curve of arbitrary shape could serve as an initial position for a vibrating string extended the idea of function, andthe work of fourier [VI.25](/part-06/jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier-17681830) in the early nineteenth century made such functions analytically accessible. In this context, functions with broken graphs (a kind of discontinuous function) came under inspection.
Later, how to deal with such functions would be a decisive issue for the foundations of analysis, as the more “nat-ural” objects associated with algebraic operations and trigonometry gave way to the more general modern concept of function.

2.2 Responses from the Late Eighteenth Century One significant response to Berkeley in Britain was thatof Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), whose 1742 textbook A Treatise of Fluxions attempted to clarify the foundations of the calculus and do away with the ideaof infinitely small quantities. Maclaurin, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment of the mid eighteenth century, was the most distinguished british mathematician of his time and an ardent proponent of Newton’s methods.
His work, unlike that of many of his British contemporaries, was read with intereston the Continent, especially his elaborations of Newtonian celestial mechanics. Maclaurin attempted to base his reasoning on the notion of the limits of what he termed “assignable” finite quantities. Maclaurin’s workis famously obscure, though it did provide examples of calculating the limits of ratios. Perhaps his most important contribution to the clarification of the foundations of analysis was his influence on d’Alembert.
and followed them in rejecting infinitesimals as real D’Alembert had read both Berkeley and Maclaurin quantities. While exploring the idea of a differential asa limit, he also attempted to reconcile his idea with the idea that infinitesimals may be consistently regarded as being actually zero, perhaps in a nod to Euler’sview. The main exposition of d’Alembert’s views may

122

be found in the fer en ti a ls (published in 1754) and on limits (1765).Encyclopédie, in the articles on dif D’Alembert argued for the importance of geometric rather than algebraic limits. His meaning seems to have been that the quantities being investigated should notbe treated merely formally, by substitution and simplification. Rather, a limit should be understood as the limit of a length (or collection of lengths), area, or other dimensioned quantity, in much the way that a circle may be seen as a limit of inscribed polygons.
His aim seems primarily to have been to establish the reality of the objects described by existing algorithms, since the actual calculations he employs are carried out with differentials.

2.2.1 Lagrange

In the course of the eighteenth century, the differential and the integral calculus gradually distinguished themselves as a set of methods distinct from their applica-tions in mechanics and physics. At the same time, the primary focus of the methods moved away from geom-etry, so that in work of the second half of the eighteenth century we increasingly see calculus treated as “alge-braic analysis” of “analytic functions.” The term “analytic” was used in a variety of senses.
For many writers, such as Euler, it merely referred to a function (that is, a relationship between variable quantities) that is given by a single expression of the type used in analysis. was indebted to this algebraic viewpoint. lagrange concentrated on power-series expansions as the basic Lagrange provided a foundation for the calculus that entity of analysis, and through his work the term ana-lytic function evolved toward its more recent meaning connected with the existence of a convergent Tay-lor series representation. His approach reached a full expression in his1797.
This was a version of his lectures at the École Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques of Polytechnique, a new institution for the elite trainingof military engineers in revolutionary France. Lagrange assumed that a function must necessarily be express-ible as an infinite series of algebraic functions, basing this argument on the existence of expansions for known functions. He first sought to show that “in gen-eral” no negative or fractional powers would appear in the expansion, and from this he obtained a power-series representation.
His arguments here are surprising, and some what ad hoc, and I use an example given by Fraser (1987). The slightly strange notation is based on that of Lagrange. Suppose that one seeks an expan-sion off (x) = . qrt{x} + i in powers of i. In general, only

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

integer powers will be involved. Terms of the form im/ndo not make sense, says Lagrange, since the expression of the function. qrt{x} + i is only two - valued, while im/n hasn values. Hence the series. qrtx + i = x + pi + qi2 + · · · +. qrt{ti}k + · · · obtains its two values from the term powers must be integral. With fractional exponents setx, and all other aside, Lagrange argued that f (x + i) = f (x) +ia P (x, i)$, \text{with Pfinite fori} = 0$.
Successive application of this result gave him the expansion $f (x + i) = f (x) + pi + qi^{2} + r i^{3} + · · ·$, where on$x$, so Lagrange defined ai was a small increment. The number derived functionp de pen dsf^ (x) =p(x)derivative, and in Lagrange’s language. The French term dérivée is the origin of the term$f$is the “primitive” of this derived function. Similar arguments can be made to relate the higher coefficients to the higher derivatives in the usual Taylor formula.
This approach, which seems oddly circular to modern eyes, relied on the eighteenth-century distinction between the “algebraic” infinite process of the series expansion on the one hand, and the use of differentials on the other. Lagrange did not see the original series expansion as based on the limit process. With the renewed emphasis on limits and modern defini-tions developed by Cauchy, this approach was soon to be regarded as untenable. 3 The First Half of the Nineteenth Century

3.1 Cauchy

Many writers contributed to discussions on rigor inanalysis in the first decades of the nineteenth century. It was Cauchy who was to revive the limit approach to greatest effect. His aim was pedagogical, and his ideas were probably worked out in the context of preparing his introductory lectures for the École Polytechnique atthe beginning of the 1820 s. Although the students were the best in France in scholarly ability, many found the approach too difficult.
As a result, while Cauchy himself continued to use his methods, other instructors held on to older approaches using infinitesimals, which they found more intuitively accessible for the studentsas well as better adapted to the solution of problems in elementary mechanics. Cauchy’s self-imposed exile from Paris in the 1830 s further limited the impact of his approach, which was initially taken up only by afew of his students.

II.5. The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis nuity, and of the derivative gradually came into gen-Nonetheless, Cauchy’s definitions of limit, of con ti eral use in France, and were influential elsewhere aswell, especially in Italy. More over, his methods of using these definitions in proofs, and particularly his use ofmean value theorems in various forms, moved analysis from a collection of symbolic manipulations of quanti-ties with special properties toward the science of argument about infinite processes using close estimation via the manipulation of inequalities.
In some respects,
Cauchy’s greatest contribution lay in his clear definitions. For earlier writers, the sumof an infinite series was a some what vague notion, some times interpreted by a kind of convergence argu-ment (as with the sum of a geometric series such as . nftyn=0 2-n) and some times as the value of the function from which the series was derived (as Euler, for exam-ple, often regarded it). Cauchy revised the definition to state that the sum of an infinite series was the limit of the sequence of partial sums.
This provided a unified approach for series of numbers and series of func-tions, an important step in the move to base calculus and analysis on ideas about real numbers. This trend, eventually dominant, is often referred to as the “arithmetization of analysis.” Similarly, a continuous function is one for which “an infinitely small increase ofthe variable produces an infinitely small increase of the function itself” (Cauchy 1821, pp. 34–35). not shy away from infinitely small quantities, nor didhe analyze this notion further.
The limit of a variable As we see from the example just given, Cauchy did quantity is defined in a way that we would now regard as conversational, or heuristic: When the values that are successively assigned to agiven variable approach a fixed value indefinitely, in such a way that it ends up differing from it as little asone wishes, this latter value is called the limit of all the others. Thus, for example, an irrational number is the limit of the various fractions that provide values that are closer and closer to it. Cauchy (1821, p.
4) These ideas were not completely rigorous by modern standards, but he was able to use them to provide a unified foundation for the basic processes of analysis. example, in his definition of a continuous function. to paraphrase his definition, suppose that a function This use of infinitely small quantities appears, forf (x) is single-valued on some finite interval of the real line, and choose any valuex0 inside the interval. If the value123 ofby the amount x0 is increased tof (x x + 0 + a)a-, the function also changesf (x ).
Cauchy says that the function each value ofxf is continuous for this interval if, forin that interval, the numerical value o(f0)0 the difference to 0 witha. In other words, Cauchy defines continu-f ((x0)0 + a) - f (x0) decreases indefinitely ity as a propertyin essence by saying that on that interval infinitely on an interval rather than at a point, small changes in the argument produce infinitely small changes in the function value.
Cauchy appears to have considered continuity to be a property of a function on an interval. This definition emphasizes the importance of jumps in the value of the function for the understanding ofits properties, something that Cauchy had encountered early in his career when discussing theorem of calculus [I.3 §5.5](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). In his 1814 memoir the fundamental on definite integrals, Cauchy stated: If the function tinuous manner betweenφ(z) increases or decreases in a con - z = b^ and z = b^ , the value of the integral [represented by$φ(b)b - b φ(bφ (z))$. But if ...

Oeuvres (volume 1, pp. 402–3) defining the definite integral. He considered first of alla division of the interval of integration into a finite In his lectures, Cauchy assumed continuity when number of subintervals on which the function is either increasing or decreasing.
(This is not possible for all functions, but this appeared not to concern Cauchy.)He then defined the definite integral as the limit of the sum(X - Sx = )f (x(x1 - x)0)f (xas the number0) + (x2 - xn1)f (xbe comes very1) + · · · + large. Cauchy gives a detailed argument for the exis-tence of this limit, using his theorem of the mean and$(n - 1()n)-1$ the fact of continuity. Versions of the main subjects of Cauchy’s lectures were published in 1821 and 1823. Every student at theÉcole Polytechnique would have been aware of them subsequently, and many would have used them explic - itly.
They were joined in 1841 by a version of the course elaborated by Cauchy’s associate, the Abbé Moigno. They were referred to frequently in France and the definitions employed by Cauchy became standard there. We also know that the lectures were studied by others, notably by spent time in Paris in the 1820 s, and byabel [VI.33](/part - 06/niels - henrik - abel - 18021829) and dirichlet [VI.36], who riemann [VI.49].

One famous example, the function that takes the valuee-1 /x2 when x . neq 0 and zero when x =0, is differentiable infinitely many times, yet it does not yielda Taylor series that converges to the function at the origin.
Despite this example, which he mentioned inhis lectures, Cauchy was not a specialist in counterexamples, and in fact the trend toward producing counterexamples for the purpose of clarifying definitions was a later development. work: his statement that a convergent series of contin-Abel famously drew attention to an error in Cauchy’s uous functions has a continuous sum. For this to betrue, the series must be uniformly convergent, and in 1826 Abel gave as a counterexample the series

. nf ty(-1()k)+1 . in kkx, k=1

which is discontinuous at odd multiples ofπ. Cauchy was led to make this distinction only much later, after the phenomenon had been identified by several writers. Historians have written extensively about this apparent error; one influential account, due to Bottazzini, proposes that for various reasons Cauchy would not have found Abel’s example telling, even if he had known of it at the time (this account appears in Bottazzini (1990, p. LXXXV)).
Before leaving the time of Cauchy, we should note the related independent activity of Bolzano, a Bohemian priest and professor whose ideas bolzano [VI.28](/part-06/bernard-bolzano-17811848). were not widely disseminated at the time, investigated the foundations of the calculus extensively. In 1817, for example, he gave what he termed a “purely ana-lytic proof of the theorem that between any two values that possess opposite signs, at least one real root ofthe equation exists”: the intermediate value theorem. Bolzano also studied infinite sets:
what is now called the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem states that for every bounded infinite set there is at least one point having the property that any disk about that point contains infinitely many points of the set. Such “limit points” were studied independently by By the 1870 s, Bolzano’s work became more broadly weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897). known.

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

3.2 Riemann, the Integral, and Counterexamples Riemann is indelibly associated with the foundations of analysis because of the Riemann integral, which is partof every calculus course. Despite this, he was not always driven by issues involving rigor. Indeed he remains a standard example of the fruitfulness of nonrigorous intuitive invention. There are many points in Riemann’s work at which issues about rigor arise naturally, and the wide interest in his innovations did much to direct the attention of researchers to making these insights precise.
Riemann’s definition of the definite integral was presented in his 1854 sis,” which qualified him to lecture at a university for habilitationsch rift—the “second the fees. He generalized Cauchy’s notion to functions that are not necessarily continuous. He did this as part of an investigation of fourier series [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) expansions. The extensive theory of such series was devised by Fourier in 1807 but not published until the 1820 s. A fourier series represents a function in the form f (x) = a0 +n. nfty=1(an . os (nx) + bn . in (nx)) on a finite interval.
dirichlet earlier faulty work by Cauchy on the question of when The immediate inspiration for Riemann’s work was[VI.36], who had corrected and developed and whether the Fourier series expansion of a function converges to the function from which it is derived. In 1829 Dirichlet had succeeded in proving such convergence for a function with period 2 on an interval of that length, does not possess infinitelyπ that is integrable many maxima and minima there, and at jump discontinuities takes on the average value between the two limiting values on each side.
As Riemann noted, following his professor Dirichlet, “this subject stands in the closest connection to the principles of infinitesimal cal-culus, and can therefore serve to bring these to greater clarity and definiteness” (Riemann 1854, p. 238). Riemann sought to extend Dirichlet’s investigations to fur-ther cases, and was thus led to investigate in detail each of the conditions given by Dirichlet. Accordingly, he generalized the definition of a definite integral as follows: We take between value sx , x , . . .
, xa and, and for brevity designateb an increasing sequence ofx -a$by$δ1$, (x1)2 - 2x1 by δn - 2$,1. . ., b - xn-1 by δn and by1 a

In connection with this definition of the integral, andin part to show its power, Riemann provided an example of a function that is discontinuous in any interval, yet can be integrated. The integral thus has points of nondifferentiab ility on each interval. Riemann’s definition rendered problematic the inverse relationship between differentiation and integration, and his example brought this problem out clearly. The role of such “pathological” counterexamples in pushing the devel-opment of rigor, already apparent in Cauchy’s work, intensified greatly around this time. lowing his death;
an expository version due to Gaston Riemann’s definition was published only in 1867, fol Darboux appeared in French in 1873. The populariza-tion and extension of Riemann’s approach went hand in hand with the increasing appreciation of the impor-tance of rigor associated with the Weierstrass school, discussed below. Riemann’s approach focused attention on sets of points of discontinuities, and thus were seminal for cantor’s [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918) investigations into point sets in the 1870 s and afterwards.
ther example of the way in which Riemann’s work drew The use of the Dirichlet principle serves as a fur attention to problems in the foundations of analysis. In connection with his research into complex analysis, Riemann was led to investigate solutions to the so-called on the boundary of a closed region in the plane, does Dirichlet problem: given a function$g$, defined there exist a function partial differential equation$f$that satisfies the[I.3 §5.4](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) in the inte-laplace rior and takes the same values asg on the bound- ary?
Riemann asserted that the answer was yes. to demonstrate this, he reduced the question to proving the existence of a function that minimizes a cer-tain integral over the region, and argued on physical grounds that such a minimizing function must always exist. Even before Riemann’s death his assertion was questioned by weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), who published a counterexample in 1870. This led to attempts to refor-mulate Riemann’s results and prove them by other

means, and ultimately to a rehabilitation of the Dirich-let principle through the provision of precise and broad hypotheses for its validity, which were expressed by hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) in 1900. 4 Weierstrass and His School Weierstrass had a passion for mathematics as a student at Bonn and Münster, but his student career was very uneven. He spent the years from 1840 to 1856 as a high school teacher, under taking research independently but at first publishing obscurely.
Papers from 1854 onward in Journal für die reine und angewandte mathematik wide attention to his talent, and he obtained a profes-(otherwise known as Crelle’s Journal) attracted sorship in Berlin in 1856. Weierstrass began to lecture regularly on mathematical analysis, and his approach to the subject developed into a series of four courses of lectures given cyclically between the early 1860 sand 1890. The lectures evolved over time and were attended by a large number of important mathemat i-cal researchers.
They also indirectly influenced many others through the circulation of unpublished notes. This circle included R. Lipschitz, P. du Bois-Reymond, H. A. Schwarz, O. Hölder, Cantor, L. Koenigsberger, G. Mittag-Leffler, name only some of the most important. Through their kovalevskaya [VI.59](/part-06/sofya-sonya-kovalevskaya-18501891), and L. Fuchs, to use of Weierstrass i an approaches in their own research, and their espousal of his ideas in their own lectures, these approaches became widely used well before the eventual publication of a version of his lectures late in his life.
The account that follows is based largely onthe 1878 version of the lectures. His approach was also influential out side Germany: parts of it were absorbedin France in the lectures of hermite [VI.47](/part-06/charles-hermite-18221901) and jordan [VI.52](/part-06/camille-jordan-18381922), for example. (though the detailed relationship between the two bod-Weierstrass’s approach builds on that of Cauchy ies of work has never been fully examined).
The two overarching themes of Weierstrass’s approach are, on the one hand, the banning of the idea of motion, orchanging values of a variable, from limit processes, and, on the other, the representation of functions, notably of a complex variable. The two are intimately linked. Essential to the motion-free definition of a limit is Weierstrass’s nascent investigation of what we would now call the topology of the real line or complex plane, with the idea of a limit point, and a clear distinc-tion between local and global behavior.
The central objects of study for Weierstrass are functions (of one

or more real or complex variable quantities), but it should be borne in mind that set theory is not involved, so that functions are ordered pairs. not to be thought of as sets of The lectures begin with a now-familiar subject: the development of rational, negative, and real numbers from the integers. For example, negative numbers are defined operationally by making the integers closed under the operation of subtraction. He attempted a unified approach to the definition of rational and irrational numbers which involved unit fractions and decimal expansions and now seems some what murky.
Weier-strass’s definition of the real numbers appears unsatisfactory to modern eyes, but the general path oft ization of analysis was established by this approach. In a ri th me parallel to the development of number systems, he also developed different classes of functions, building them up from rational functions by using power-series rep-re sent at i ons. Thus, in Weierstrass’s approach, a polynomial (called an integer rational function) is general-ized to a “function of integer character,” which means a function with a convergent power-series expansion every where.
The Weierstrass factorization theorem asserts that any such function may be written as a (pos-sibly infinite) product of certain “prime” functions and exponential functions with polynomial exponents of a certain type. oughly modern features: The limit definition given by Weierstrass has thor That a variable quantity simultaneously with another quantity xbe comes infinitely smallymeans: “After the assumption of an arbitrarily small quantity boundδ for x may be found, such that for every valuea ofwill be less thanx for which |x|.”< δ, the corresponding value of |y| Weierstrass (1988, p.

The former notions of variables tending to given values were replaced by quantified statements about linked inequalities. The framing of hypotheses in terms of inequalities became a guiding motif in the work of Weierstrass’s school: here we men-tion in passing the Lipschitz and Hölder conditions in the existence theory for differential equations.

a routine way by those inculcated in the weierstrass approach. The fact that general functions were built from rational functions using series expansions gave the lat-ter a key role in Weierstrass’s work, and as early as 1841 he had identified the importance of uniform con-vergence. The distinction between uniform and pointwise convergence was made very clearly in his lectures. A series converges, as it does for Cauchy, ifits sequence of partial sums converges, though now the convergence is phrased in the following terms:
theseriesf (x) converges to s at x = x if, given an arbitrary positive|s - (f (xn ) + f (x, there is an integer) + · · · +0 f (x ))| <0 N such that for everyn > Nvariable if the same0. The convergence is uniform on a domain of th(e1)0 2 N0 will work for tha(tn)0 value for allx in the domain. Uniform convergence guarantees con- tinuity of the sum, since these are series of rational, hence continuous, functions. From this point of view, then, uniform convergence is important well beyond the context of trigonometric series (important though those may be).
Indeed, it is a central tool of the entire theory of functions. others, notably Riemann, has already been noted. More than any other leading figure, he generated counter-Weierstrass’s role as a critic of rigor in the work of examples to illustrate difficulties with received notions and to distinguish between different kinds of analyti-cal behavior. One of his best-known examples was of an every where-continuous but no where-differentiable function, namely$f (x) = b^{n} \cos (a^{n}x)$, which is uni- formly convergent forentiable at anyx if ab >b <11 but fails to be differ-$+ {}^{3}π$.
Similarly he con- struc ted functions for which the Dirichlet principle fails, examples of sets constituting “natural bound-2 aries,” that is, obstacles to continuing series expan-sions into larger domains, and so forth. The careful distinctions he encouraged, and the very procedure of seeking pathological rather than typical examples, threw the spotlight on the precision of hypotheses in analysis to an unprecedented degree.
From the 1880 s, with the maturity of this program, analysis no longer dealt with generic cases and looked instead for absolutely precise statements in a way that has for the most part endured to the present. This was also to become a pattern and an imperative in other areas of mathe-matics, though some times the passage from reasoning from generic examples to fully expressed hypotheses and definitions took decades. (Algebraic geometry pro-vides a famous example, one in which reasoning with

II.5. The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis generic cases lasted until the 1920 s.) In this sense the form of rigorous argument and exposition espoused by Weierstrass and his school was to become a pattern for mathematics generally.

4.1 The Aftermath of Weierstrass and Riemann

Analysis became the model subdiscipline for rigor fora variety of reasons. Of course, analysis was important for the sheer volume and range of application of its results. Not every one agreed with the precise way in which Weierstrass approached foundational questions(through series, rational functions, and so on). Indeed, Riemann’s more geometric approach had also attracted followers, if not exactly a school, and the insights his approach afforded were enthusiastic ally embraced.
However, any subsequent discussion had to take place at a level of rigor comparable to that which Weierstrass had attained. While approaches to the foundations ofanalysis were to vary, the idea that limits should be rigorously handled in much the way that Weierstrass didwas not to alter.
Among the remaining central issues for rigor was the definition of the number systems. For the real numbers, probably the most successful definition (in terms of its later use) was provided bythe integers as fundamental, and extended them to the dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916). Dedekind, like Weierstrass, took rationals, noting that the algebraic properties satisfiedby the latter are those satisfied by what we now call a field showed that the rational numbers satisfy a[I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).
(This idea is also Dedekind’s.) He then trichotomy law collection into three parts:. That is, each rational numberx itself, rational number sx divides the entire greater than also showed that the rationals greater and less than ax, and rational numbers less than x. He given number extend to infinity, and that any rational corresponds to a distinct point on the number line. However, he also observed that along that line there are infinitely many points that do not correspond to any rational.
Using the idea that to every point on the line there should correspond a number, he constructed the remainder of the continuum (that is, the real line)by the use of cuts. These are ordered pairs(A , A ) of nonempty sets of rational numbers such that every ele-ment of the first set is less than every element of the1 2 second, and such that taken together they contain allthe rationals. Such cuts may obviously be produced by an element ment of A1 xor the least element of, in which case x is either the greatest ele-A2.
But some times Ament, and in that case we can use the cut to define a1 does not have a greatest element, or A2 a least ele-127 new number, which is necessarily irrational. The set ofall such cuts may be shown to correspond to the points of the number line, so that nothing is left out. A critical reader might feel that this is begging the question, since the idea of the number line constituting a continuum in some way might seem to be a hidden premise. Dedekind’s construction stimulated a good deal of discussion, especially in Germany, about the best way to found the real numbers.
Participants included Can - tor, E. Heine, and the logician frege [VI.56](/part - 06/gottlob - frege - 18481925). Heine and Cantor, for example, considered real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rationals, together with a machinery that permitted them to define the basic arithmetical operations. A very simi-lar approach was proposed by the French mathematician Charles Méray. Frege, by contrast, in his 1884 Grundlagen der Arithmetik, sought to found the inte-Die gerson logic.
While his attempts to construct the reals along these lines did not bear fruit, he had an important role in his insistence that the various con struc-tions should not merely be mathematically functional but should also be demonstrably free from internal contradiction. real numbers, infinite sets, and other basic notions for analysis, consensus remained elusive.
For example, the Despite much activity on the foundations of the influential Berlin mathematician[VI.48](/part - 06/leopold - kronecker - 18231891) denied the existence of the reals, and held that leopold kronecker all true mathematics was to be based on finite sets. Like Weierstrass, with whom he worked and whom he influenced, he emphasized the strong analogies between the integers and the polynomials, and sought to use this algebraic foundation to build all of mathematics. Hence for Kronecker the entire main path of research in analysis was anathema, and he opposed it ardently.
These views were influential, both directly and indirectly, on a number of later writers, including the intuitionist school around him, and the algebraist brouwer [VI.75](/part - 06/luitzen - egbertus - jan - brouwer - 18811966), and number theorist Kurt Hensel. or another on an underlying notion (not always made explicit) of quantity. The foundational framework of All efforts to found analysis were based in one way analysis, however, was to shift over the period from1880 to 1910 toward the theory of sets.
This had its origin in the work of Cantor, a student of weierstrass who began studying discontinuities of Fourier series in the early 1870 s. Cantor became concerned about howto distinguish between different types of infinite sets. His proofs that the rational numbers and the algebraic numbers are countable [III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets) while the reals are not 128 led him to a hierarchy of infinite sets of different car - dinality.
The importance of this discovery for analysis was at first not widely recognized, though in the 1880 s Mittag-Leffler and Hurwitz both made significant appli-ca tions of notions about derived sets (the set of limit points of a given set) and dense or no where-dense sets. Cantor gradually came to the view that set theory could function as a foundational tool for all of mathematics. As early as 1882 he wrote that the science of sets encompassed arithmetic, function theory, and geometry, combining them into a “higher unity” based on the idea of cardinality.
However, this proposal was vaguely articulated and at first attracted no adherents. Nonetheless, sets began to find their way into the language of analysis, most notably through ideas ofone important route to the absorption of analysis by measure [III.55](/part - 03/measures) and measurability of a set. Indeed, set theory was the path that sought to determine what kind of function could “measure” a set in anabstract sense.
The work of lebesgue [VI.72](/part - 06/henri - lebesgue - 18751941) and borel [VI.70](/part - 06/emile - borel - 18711956) around 1900 on integration and measurability tied set theory to the calculus in a very concrete and intimate way. da tions of analysis in the early twentieth century wasa new emphasis on mathematical theories as axiomatic A further key step in the establishment of the foun structures. This received enormous impetus from the work of Hilbert, who, beginning in the 1890 s, had sought to provide a renewed axiomatization of geom - etry.
peano [VI.62](/part - 06/giuseppe - peano - 18581932) in Italy headed a school with similar aims. Hilbert redefined the reals on these axiomatic grounds, and his many students and associates turned to axiomatics with enthusiasm for the clarity the approach could provide. Rather than proving the exis-tence of specific entities such as the reals, the mathematician posits a system satisfying the fundamental properties they possess. A real number (or whatever object) is then defined by the set of axioms provided.
As Epple has pointed out, such definitions were con-side red to be on to logically neutral in that they did not provide methods for telling real numbers from other objects, or even state whether they existed at all (Epple 2003, p. 316). Hilbert’s student Ernst Zermelo began work on axiomatizing set theory along these lines, pub-li shing his axioms in 1908 (see [IV.22 §3](/part - 04/set - theory)). Problems with set theory had emerged in the form of paradoxes, the most famous due to russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970):
if S is the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, then it isnot possible for S to be in S, nor can it not be in S. Zermelo’s axiomatics sought to avoid this difficulty, in part

by avoiding the definition of set. By 1910, was to refer to mathematics as the science of “weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955)$\in$,” or set membership, rather than the science of quantity. Nonetheless, Zermelo’s axioms as a foundational strategy were contested. For one thing, a consistency proof for the axioms was lacking. Such “meaning-free” axiomatization was also contested on the grounds that it removed intuition from the picture.
Against the complex and rapidly developing background of mathematics in the early twentieth century, these debates took on many dimensions that have implications well beyond the question of what consti-tutes rigorous argument in analysis. For the practicing analyst, however, as well as for the teacher of basic infinitesimal calculus, these discussions are marginalto everyday mathematical life and education, and are treated as such. Set theory is pervasive in the language used to describe the basic objects.
Real-valued functions of one real variable are defined as sets of ordered pairs of real numbers, for example; a set-theoretic defi-nition of an ordered pair was given by wiener [VI.85](/part-06/norbert-wiener-18941964) in 1914, and the set-theoretic definition of functions maybe dated from that time. However, research in analysis has been largely distinct from, and generally avoids, the foundational issues that may remain in connection with this vocabulary. This is not at all to say that contemporary mathematicians treat analysis in a purely formal way.
The intuitive content associated with numbers and functions is very much a part of the way of thinking ofmost mathematicians. The axioms for the reals and for set theory form a framework to be referred to when necessary. But the essential objects of basic analysis, namely derivatives, integrals, series, and their existenceor convergence behaviors, are dealt with along the lines of the early twentieth century, so that the ontological debates about the infinitesimal and infinite are no longer very lively. robinsonsis, published in 1961.

Despite stimulating a flurry of activity, and considerable acclaim from some quarters, Robin-son’s approach has never been widely accepted as a working foundation for analysis.

Preliminary Considerations1 Introduction and

In many respects the development of the idea of proof is coextensive with the development of mathematics as a whole. Looking back into the past, one might at first consider mathematics to be a body of scientific knowledge that deals with the properties of num-bers, magnitudes, and figures, obtaining its justifications from proofs rather than, say, from experiments or inductive inferences. Such a character ization, however, is not with out problems. For one thing, it imme-diately leaves out important chapters in the history

of civilization that are more naturally associated with mathematics than with any other intellectual activity. For example, the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures developed elaborate bodies of knowledge that would most naturally be described as belonging to arithmetic or geometry, even though nothing is found in them that comes close to the idea of proof as it was later practiced in mathematics at large. To the extent that any justification is given, say, in the thousands of mathematical procedures found on clay tablets written incuneiform script, it is inductive or based on experience.
The tablets repetitively show—with out additional explanation or attempts at general justifications—a given procedure to be followed whenever one is pursu-ing a certain type of result. Later on, in the context of Chinese, Japanese, Mayan, or Hindu cultures, one again finds important developments in fields naturally associated with mathematics.
The extent to which these cul-tures pursued the idea of mathematical proof—a question that is debated among historians to this day—was undoubtedly not as great as it was in Greek tradition, and it certainly did not take the specific forms we typically associate with the latter. Should one nevertheless say that these are instances of mathematical knowledge, even though they are not justified on the basis of some kind of general, deductive proof? If so, then we cannot characterize mathematics as a body ofknowledge that is backed up by proofs, as suggested above.
However, this litmus test certainly provides a useful criterion—one that we do not want to give up too easily—for distinguishing mathematics from other intellectual endeavors. With out totally ignoring these important questions, the present account focuses on a story that started, at some point in the past, usually taken to be before or around the fifth century realization that there was a distinctive body of claims, b.c.e.
in Greece, with the mainly associated with numbers and with diagrams, whose truth could be and needed to be vindicated ina very special way—namely, by means of a general, deductive argument, or “proof.” Exactly when and how this story began is unclear. Equally unclear are the direct historical sources of such a unique idea.
Since the emphasis on the use of logic and reason in constructing an argument was well-entrenched in other spheres of public life in ancient Greece—such as politics, rhetoric, and law—much earlier than the fifth century possible that it is in those domains that the origins ofb.c.e., it is mathematical proof are to be found.

tions, both historical and methodological. For instance, Thales of Miletus, the first mathematician known by The early stages of this story raise additional quesname (though he was also a philosopher and scientist), is reported to have proved several geometric theorems, such as, for instance, that the opposite angles between two intersecting straight lines are equal, or that if two vertices of a triangle are the endpoints of the diameter of a circle and the third is any other point onthe circle then the triangle must be right angled.
Even if we were to accept such reports at face value, sev-eral questions would immediately arise: in what sense can it be asserted that Thales “proved” these results? More specifically, what were Thales’s initial assump-tions and what inference methods did he take to be valid? We know very little about this. However, we doknow that, as a result of a complex historical process, a certain corpus of knowledge eventually developed that comprised known results, techniques employed, and problems (both solved and yet requiring solution).
This corpus gradually also incorporated the regulatory idea of proof: that is, the idea that some kind of general argument, rather than an example (or even many examples), was the necessary justification to be sought in all cases. As part of this development, the idea of proof came to be associated with strictly deductive arguments, as opposed to, say, dialogic (meaning “nego-tiated”) or “probabilistic ally inferred” truth. It is an interesting and difficult historical question to establish why this was the case, and one that we will not address here.

It stands out as the most suc-was compiled some time cessful and comprehensive attempt of its kind to orga-nize the basic concepts, results, proofs, and techniques required by anyone wanting to master this increasingly complex body of knowledge. Still, it is important to stress that it was not the only such attempt within the Hellenic world. This endeavor was not just a matter of compilation, codification, and canonization, such asone can find in any other evolving field of learning at any point in time.
Instead, the assertions it contained were of two different kinds, and the distinction was vitally important. On the one hand there were basic assumptions, ortheorems, which were typically more elaborate state-axioms, and on the other there were ments, together with accounts of how they followed from the axioms—that is, proofs. The way that proof was conceived and realized in the Elements became the paradigm for centuries to come.

deductive proof as initially shaped in the frameworkof Euclidean-style mathematics and as subsequently This article out lines the evolution of the idea of practiced in the mainstream mathematical culture of ancient Greece, the Islamic world, Renaissance Europe, early modern European science, and then in the nine-teenth century and at the turn of the twentieth. The main focus will be on geometry: other fields like arith-metic and algebra will be treated mainly in relation to it. This choice is amply justified by the subject matter itself.
Indeed, much as mathematics stands out among the sciences for the unique way in which it relies on proof, so Euclidean-style geometry stood out—at least until well into the seventeenth century—among closely related disciplines such as arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry. Results in these other disciplines, or indeed the disciplines as a whole, were often regarded as fully legitimate only when they had been provided with a geometric (or geometric-like) foundation.
However, important developments in nineteenth-century math-ematics, mainly in connection with the rise of noneuclidean geometries lems in the foundations of analysis [[II.2 §§6–10]](/part-02/geometry) and with prob-[II.5](/part-02/rigor-in-analysis), eventually led to a fundamental change of orientation, where arithmetic (and eventually bastion of certainty and clarity from which other math-set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory)) became the ematical disciplines, geometry included, drew their legitimacy and their clarity.
(See the crisis in the foundations of mathematics [II.7](/part-02/foundations-crisis) for a detailed account of this development.) And yet, even before this fundamental change, Euclidean-style proof was not the only way in which mathematical proof was con-ceived, explored, and practiced. By focusing mainly on geometry, the present account will necessarily leave out important developments that eventually became the mainstream of legitimate mathematical knowledge.
To mention just one important example in this regard, a fundamental question that will not be pursued here is how the principle of mathematical induction originated and developed, became accepted as a legitimate infer-ence rule of universal validity, and was finally codified as one of the basic axioms of arithmetic in the late nine-teenth century.
More over, the evolution of the notion of proof involves many other dimensions that will not be treated here, such as the development of the inter-nal organization of mathematics into subdisciplines, as well as the changing interrelations between math-ematics and its neighboring disciplines. At a different level, it is related to how mathematics itself evolved as

All proofs appearing in the ments have six parts and are accompanied by a dia-Ele gram.
I illustrate this with the example of pro posi-tion I.37. Euclid’s text is quoted here in the classical translation of Sir Thomas Heath, and the meaning of some terms differs from current usage. Thus, two tri-angles are said to be “in the same parallels” if they have the same height and both their bases are contained ina single line, and any two figures are said to be “equal” if their areas are equal. For the sake of explanation, names of the parts of the proof have been added: these do not appear in the original. The proof is illustrated in figure 1.

This formal struc-ture is also followed in all propositions appearing in the three importantly, all of them are always accompanied by aarithmetic books of the Elements and, most diagram.
Thus, for instance, consider proposition IX.35, which in its original version reads as follows: If as many numbers as we please be in continued pro - portion, and there be subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal to the first, then, as the excess of the second is to the first, so will the excess of the last be to all those before it. hensible on first reading.
In more modern terms, an equivalent to this theorem would state that, given a This cumbersome formulation may prove in com pre geometric progression$a1$, a2,$. . . , (an)+1$, we have(an + 1 - a1):$(a1 + a2 + · · · + an) = (a2 - a1):$ a1. This translation, however, fails to convey the spirit of the original, in which no formal symbolic manipulation is, or can be, made. More importantly, a modern algebraic proof fails to convey the ubiquity of diagrams in Greek mathematical proofs, even where they are not needed for a truly geometric construction.
Indeed, the accompanying diagram for proposition IX.35 is shown

132

as figure 2 and the first few lines of the proof are as follows: Let there be as many numbers as we please in contin-ued proportion A, BC, D, EF, beginning from A as least and let there be subtracted from BC and EF the num-bers BG, FH, each equal to A; I say that, as GC is to A, so is EH to A, BC, D. For let FK be made equal to BC and FL equal to D.. . .
This proposition and its proof provide good examples of the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of ancient Greek practices of notation, and especially of how they managed with out a truly symbolic language. In particular, they demonstrate that proofs were never conceived by the Greeks, even ideally, as purely logical constructs, but rather as specific kinds of arguments that one applied to a diagram. The diagram was not just a visual aid to the argument at i on.
Rather, through the ekthesis part of the proof, it embodied the idea referred to by the general character and formulation of the proposition. Together with the centrality of diagrams, the sixpart structure is also typical of most of Greek math-ematics. The constructions and diagrams that typically appeared in Greek mathematical proofs were notof an arbitrary kind, but what we identify today as straightedge-and-compass constructions.
The reason-ing in the apodeixis part could be either a direct deduction or an argument by contradiction, but the result was always known in advance and the proof was a means to justify it. In addition, Greek geometric thinking, and in particular Euclid-style geometric proofs, strictly adhered to a principle of homogeneity. That is, magnitudes were only compared with, added to, or subtracted from magnitudes of like kind—numbers, lengths, areas, or volumes.
(See numbers [II.1 §2](/part-02/from-numbers-to-number-systems) for more about this.) cerned with lengths of curves, as well as with areas or Of particular interest are those Greek proofs con volumes enclosed by curvilinear shapes. Greek mathe-maticians lacked a flexible notation capable of expressing the gradual approximation of curves by polygons and an eventual passage to the infinite.
Instead, they devised a special kind of proof that involved what can retrospectively be seen as an implicit passage to the limit, but which did so in the framework of a purely geometric proof and thus unmistakably followed the six-part proof-scheme described above. This implicit passage to the infinite was based on the application of a continuity principle, later associated with[VI.3](/part-06/archimedes-ca). In Euclid’s formulation, for instance, the princi-archimedes

Figure 3 Proposition XII.2 of Euclid’s Elements. ple states that, given two unequal magnitudes of the same kind, A, B (be they two lengths, two areas, or two volumes), with A a magnitude which is greater than A greater than B, and if we subtract from A/2, and from the remainder we subtract a magnitude that is greater than its half, and if this process is iterated a sufficient number of times, then we will eventually remain with amagnitude that is smaller than B.
Euclid used this prin- ciple to prove, for instance, that the ratio of the areasof two circles equals the ratio of the squares of their diameters (XII.2). The method used, later known as the exhaustion method, was based on a double contradiction This double contradiction is illustrated in figure 3, the that became standard for many centuries to come. accompanying diagram to the proposition. is not the same as the ratio of circle ABCD to circle EFGH, then it must be the same as the ratio of circle If the ratio of the square on BD to the square on FH ABCD to an are a cle EFGH.
The curvilinear figures are approximated by S either larger or smaller than cir- polygons, since the continuity principle allows the dif-ference between the inscribed polygon and the circle to be as close as desired (e.g., closer than the differ-ence between Sand EFGH). The “double contradiction” is reached if one assumes that S is either smaller or larger than EFGH.Forms of proof and constructions other than those mentioned so far are occasionally found in Greek math-ematical texts.
These include diagrams based on what is assumed to be the synchronized motion of two lines (e.g., the trisectrix, or Archimedes’ spiral), mechanical devices of many sorts, or reasoning based on idealized mechanical considerations. However, the Euclid-ean type of proof described above remained a model to be followed wherever possible. There is a famous Archimedes palimpsest that provides evidence of how less canonical methods, drawing on mechanical consid-erations (albeit of a highly idealized kind), were used to

deduce results about areas and volumes. However, even this bears testimony to the primacy of the ideal model: there is a letter from Archimedes to Eratosthenes in which he displays the ingenuity of his mechanical methods but at the same time is at pains to stress their heuristic character. 3 Islamic and Renaissance Mathematics Just as Euclid is now considered to represent an entire mainstream tradition of Greek mathematics, so alkh. ar{w}Islamic mathematics.

What is the square which combined with ten of its roots will give a sum total of 39? The recipe prescribes the following steps. Take one-half of the roots itself[25]. Add this amount to 39 and obtain 64.
Take[5] and multiply them by the square root of this, which is eight, subtract from ithalf the roots, leaving three. The number three therefore represents one root of this square, which itself, of course, is nine. The justification is provided by figure 4. x102 Here ab represents the said square, which for us isx, and the rectangles c, d, e, f represent an area ofeach, so that all of them together equal 10 x, as in the problem.

Although the algebraic line of rea-soning that he adopted and developed became increasingly abstract and formal, Cardano continued to justify his arguments and methods of solution by reference to Euclid-like geometric arguments based on diagrams. 4 Seventeenth-Century Mathematics The next significant change in the conception of proof appears in the seventeenth century.
The most influen-tial development of mathematics in this period was the creation of the infinitesimal calculus simultaneously by newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) and leibniz [VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716). This momentous development was the culmination of a process that spanned most of the century, involving the introduction and gradual improvement of important tech-niques for determining areas and volumes, gradients of tangents, and maxima and minima.
These develop-ments included the elaboration of traditional points of view that went back to the Greek classics, as well as the introduction of completely new ideas such as the “indi - visibles,” whose status as a legitimate tool for mathematical proof was hotly debated.
At the same time, the algebraic techniques and approaches that Renaissance mathematicians continued to expand upon, fol-lowing on from their Islamic predecessors, now gained additional impetus and were gradually incorporated— starting with the work of car tes [VI.11](/part - 06/ren - descartes - 15961650)—into the arsenal of tools available for fermat [VI.12](/part - 06/pierre - fermat - 1601665) and des proving geometric results. Underlying these various trends were different conceptions and practices of mathematical proof, which are briefly described and illustrated now.
geometric proof was essentially followed but at the same time fruitfully modified and expanded are found Examples of how the classical Greek conception of in the work of Fermat, as can be seen in his calcul a-tion of the area enclosed by a generalized hyperbola (in modern notation(y/a)m = (x/b)n (m, n . eq 1)) and its asymptotes.

In its original version it is expressed as follows: AG2 : AH2 :: IH : EG (see figure 5). It should be noticed that this is not an equation in the present sense

Rather, this is a fourterm proportion to which the rules of Greek classical mathematics apply. Also, the proof was entirely geometric and indeed it essentially followed the euclidean style. Thus, if the segments AG, AH, AO, etc., are chosen in continued proportion, then one can prove that the rectangles EH, IO, NM, etc., are also in continued proportion, and indeed that EH : IO :: IO : NM ::· · ·:: AH : AG.
(mentioned above), which comprises an expression forthe sum of any number of quantities in a geometric Fermat made use of proposition IX.35 of the Elements progression, namely (in more modern notation): $((an)+1 - a1)$:$(a^{1} + a^{2} + · · · + a^{n}) = (a^{2} - a^{1})$:$a^{1}$.
But at this point his proof takes an interesting turn. He introduces the some what obscure concept of “adequare and which allows a kind of “approximate equality.”,” which he found in the works of Diophantus, Specifically, this idea allows him to bypass the cumber-some procedure of double contradiction typically used in Greek geometry as an implicit passage to the infi-nite.
A figure bounded by GE, by the horizontal asymptote, and by the hyperbola will equal the infinite sumof rectangles obtained when the rectangle EH “will vanish and will be reduced to nothing.” Further, pro posi-tion IX.35 implies that this sum equals the area of the rectangle BG.
Significantly, Fermat still chose to rely onthe authority of the ancients, hinting at the method of double contradiction when he declared that this result“would be easy to confirm by a more lengthy proof carried out in the manner of Archimedes.”Attempts to expand the accepted canon of geometric proof eventually led to the more progressive approaches associated with the idea of indivisibles, as

II.6. The Development of the Idea of Proof

practiced by Cavalieri, Roberval, and Torricelli. Thisis well illustrated by Torricelli’s 1643 calculation of the volume of the infinite body created by rotating the hyperbolaxy = k2 around the y -axis, with val- ues ofx between 0 and a (as we would describe it in modern terms). side red to be sums, or collections, of infinitely many line segments, and volumes are considered to be sums, The essential idea of indivisibles is that areas are conor collections, of infinitely many areas.
In this exam - ple, Torricelli calculated the volume of revolution by considering it to be a sum of the curved surfaces of an infinite collection of cylinders successively inscribed within each other and having radii ranging from 0 toa. In modern algebraic terms, the height of the inscribed cylinder with radiu sx is k2/x, so the area of its curved surface is 2 is independent ofπx(k2/x)x and equal to the area of a circle= π(. qrt{2 k})2, a constant value that of radius the geometry of indivisibles, the collection of all sur-$\sqrt{2 k}$.
Thus, in Torricelli’s approach based on faces that, when taken together, comprise the infinite body can be equated to a collection of circles with area2πk2, one for each x between 0 and a, or equivalently to a cylinder of volume 2πk2 a. The rules of Euclid-like geometric proof were completely contravened in proofs of this kind and this made them unacceptable in the eyes of many. On the other hand, their fruitfulness was highly appealing, especially in cases like this one in which an infinite body was shown to have a finite volume, a result which Torricelli himself found extremely surprising.
Both supporters and detractors alike, however, realized that tech-niques of this kind might lead to contradictions and inaccurate results. By the eighteenth century, with the accelerated development of the infinitesimal calculus and its associated techniques and concepts, techniques based on indivisibles had essentially disappeared. The limits set by the classical paradigm of Euclidean geometric proof were then transgressed in a dif-ferent direction by the all - embracing algebraization of geometry at the hands of Descartes.
The fundamental step under taken by Descartes was to introduce unit lengths as a key element in the diagrams used in geometric proofs. The radical innovation implied by this step, allowing the hitherto nonexistent possibility ofdefining operations with line segments, was explicitly stressed by Descartes in La Géométrie in 1637:
Just as arithmetic consists of only four or five oper - ations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, 135 division, and the extraction of roots, which may be considered a kind of division, so in geometry, to find required lines it is merely necessary to add or subtract other lines;
or else, taking one line, which I shall call the unit in order to relate it as closely as possible to num - bers, and which can in general be chosen arbitrarily, and having given two other lines, to find a fourth line which shall be to one of the given lines as the other is to the unit (which is the same as multiplication); or again, to find a fourth line which is to one of the given lines as the unit is to the other (which is equivalent to division);
or, finally, to find one, two, or several mean proportionals between the unit and some other line (which is the same as extracting the square root, cube root, etc., of the given line). division of their lengths is represented by BC in figure 6, Thus, for instance, given two segments BD, BE, the in which AB represents the unit length. Although the proof was Euclid-like in appearance (because of the diagram and the use of the theory of similar triangles), the introduction of the unit length and its use for defining the operations with segments set it radically apart and opened completely new
hori-zons for geometric proofs. Not only had measurements of length been absent from Euclidean-style proofs thus far, but also, as a consequence of the very existenceof these operations, the essential dimensionality traditionally associated with geometric theorems lost its significance.
Descartes used expressions such as$a$ - b$, a/b, a2$, b3, and their roots, but he stressed that they should all be understood as “only simple lines, which, however, I name squares, cubes, etc., so that I make use of the terms employed in algebra.” With the removal of dimensionality, the requirement of homogeneity also became unnecessary. Unlike his pre de ces-sors, who handled magnitudes only when they had a direct geometric significance, Descartes could not seeany problem in forming an expression such as$a2b2 - b$ and then extracting its cube root.
In order to do so, hesaid “we must consider the quantitya2 b2 divided once by the unit, and the qu anti tyb multiplied twice by the unit.” Sentences of this kind would be simply in com pre-hensible to Greek geometers, as well as to their Islamic and Renaissance followers.
newly created possibility of proving geometric factsvia algebraic procedures, was strongly related to the This algebraization of geometry, and particularly the recent consolidation of the idea of an algebraic equa-tion, seen as an autonomous mathematical entity, for which formal rules of manipulation were well-known and could be systematically applied. This idea reached

Figure 6 of the division of two given segments. Descartes’s geometric calculation full maturity in the hands of1591. But not all mathematicians in the seventeenthviète [VI.9](/part-06/franois-vite-15401603) only around century saw the important developments associated with algebraic thinking either as a direction to be naturally adopted or as a clear sign of progress in the latter discipline.
A prominent opponent of any attempt to deviate from the classical Euclidean-style approach in geometry was none other thanin the Arithmetica Universalis (1707), was emphatic in newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727), who, expressing his views: Equations are expressions of arithmetic computation and properly have no place in geometry, except in so far as truly geometrical quantities (lines, surfaces, solids and proportions) are there by shown equal, some to others.
Multiplications, divisions, and computations of that kind have recently been introduced into geometry, unadvisedly and against the first principle of this science. . . . Therefore these two sciences ought not to be confounded, and recent generations by confounding them have lost that simplicity in which all geometrical elegance consists.
Newton’s Principia bears witness to the fact that statements like this one were far from mere lip ser-vice, as Newton consistently preferred Euclidean-style proofs, considering them to be the correct language for presenting his new physics and for bestowing it with the highest degree of certainty. He used his own cal-culus only where strictly necessary, and barred algebra from his treatise entirely. Eighteenth-Century Mathematics5 Geometry and Proof in Mathematical analysis became the primary focus of mathematicians in the eighteenth century.
Questions relating to the foundations of analysis arose immediately after the calculus began to be developed and were

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

not settled until the late nineteenth century. To a con-sider able extent these questions were about the nature of legitimate mathematical proof, and debates about them played an important role in undermining the long-undisputed status of geometry as the basis for mathematical certainty and bestowing this status on arith-metic instead. The first important stage in this process was separated from its purely geometric roots, the calculus euler’s [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) reformulation of the calculus. Once came to be centered on the algebraically oriented con-cept of function.
This trend for favoring algebra over geometry was given further impetus by Euler’s suc-cessors. d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783), for instance, associated mathematical certainty above all with algebra—because of its higher degree of generality and abstraction—and only subsequently with geometry and mechanics. This was a clear departure from the typical views of Newton and of his contemporaries.
The trend reached a peak and was transformed into a well-conceived program inthe hands of lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), who in the preface to his 1788 a radical view about how one could achieve certainty Méchanique Analitique famously expressed in the mathematical sciences while distancing one self from geometry. He wrote as follows: One will not find figures in this work. The methods that I expound require neither constructions, nor geometrical or mechanical arguments, but only algebraic operations, subject to a regular and uniform course.
The details of these developments are beyond the scope of this article. What is important to stress, however, is that in spite of their very considerable impact, the basic conceptions of proof in the more mainstream realm of geometry teenth century. An illuminating perspective on these did not change very much during the ei gh conceptions is offered by the views of contemporary philosophers, especially Immanuel Kant. Kant had a very profound knowledge of contemporary science, and particularly of mathematics. A philosophical knowledge and proof need not concern us here.
How-discussion of his views on mathematical ever, given his acquaintance with contemporary con-ceptions, they do provide an insightful historical perspective on proof as it was understood at the time. of particular interest is the contrast he draws between a philosophical argument, on the one hand, and ageometric proof, on the other. Where as the former deals with general concepts, the latter deals with concrete, yet nonempirical, concepts, by reference to “visu-alizable intuitions” (Anschauung). This difference is

II.6. The Development of the Idea of Proof

epitomized in the following, famous passage from his Critique of Pure Reason. Suppose a philosopher be given the concept of a tri-angle and he is left to find out, in his own way, what relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle. He has nothing but the concept of a figure enclosed by three straight lines, and possessing three angles. How-ever long he meditates on this concept, he will never produce anything new.
He can analyze and clarify the concept of a straight line or of an angle or of the number three, but he can never arrive at any properties not already contained in these concepts. Now let the geometric i an take up these questions. He at once begins by constructing a triangle. Since he knows that the sum of two right angles is exactly equal to the sum of all the adjacent angles which can be constructed from a single point on a straight line, he prolongs one side of his tri-angle and obtains two adjacent angles, which together are equal to two right angles.
He then divides the exter-nal angle by drawing a line parallel to the opposite side of the triangle, and observes that he has thus obtainedan external adjacent angle which is equal to an internal angle—and so on. In this fashion, through a chain of inferences guided through out by intuition, he arrives at a fully evident and universally valid solution of the problem. In a nutshell, then, for Kant the nature of mathematical proof that sets it apart from other kinds of deductive argument at i on (like philosophy) lies in the central-ity of the diagrams and the role that they play.
As in the Elements, this diagram is not just a heuristic guide for what is no more than abstract reasoning, but rather an“intuition,” a singular embodiment of the mathematical idea that is clearly located not only in space, but rather in space and time. In fact, I cannot represent to myself a line, however small, with-out drawing it in thought, that is gradually generating all its parts from a point. Only in this way can the intuition be obtained.
This role played by diagrams as “visualizable intuitions” is what provides, for Kant, the explanation of why geometry is not just an empirical science, but also not just a huge tautology devoid of any synthetic con-tent. According to him, geometric proof is constrained by logic but it is much more than just a purely logical analysis of the terms involved. This view was at the heart of a novel philosophical analysis whose starting point was the then-entrenched conception of what a mathematical proof is.

6 Nineteenth-Century Mathematics andthe Formal Conception of Proof The nineteenth century was full of important develop-ments in geometry and other parts of mathematics, not just of the methods but also of the aims of the various subdisciplines. Logic, as a field of knowledge, also under went significant changes and a gradual mathematization that entirely transformed its scope and methods. Consequently, by the end of the century the con-ception of proof and its role in mathematics had also been deeply transformed.
In Göttingen in 1854 riemann [VI.49] gave his seminal talk “On the hypotheses which lie at the foun-da tions of geometry.” At around the same time, the works of bolyai [VI.34] and lobachevskii [VI.31](/part-06/nicolai-ivanovich-lobachevskii-17921856) on non-Euclidean geometry, as well as the related ideas of gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), all dating from the 1830 s, began to be more generally known.
The existence of coherent, alternative geometries brought about a pressing need forthe most basic, longstanding beliefs about the essence of geometric knowledge, including the role of proof and mathematical rigor, to be revised. Of even greater significance in this regard was the renewed interest in projective geometry [I.3 §6.7](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), which became a very active field of research with its own open research questions and foundational issues after the publication of Jean Poncelet’s 1822 treatise.
The addition of projective geometry to the many other possible geometric perspectives prompted a variety of attempts at unifi-cation and classification, the most significant of which were those based on group-theoretic ideas. Particularly not able were those of1870 s. In 1882, Moritz Pasch published an influential klein [VI.57] and lie [VI.53](/part-06/sophus-lie-18421899) in the treatise on projective geometry devoted to a systematic exploration of its axiomatic foundations and the inter-relationships among its fundamental theorems.
Pasch’s book also attempted to close the many logical gaps that had been found in Euclidean geometry over the years. More systematically than any of his fellow nineteenth century mathematicians, Pasch emphasized that all geometric results should be obtained from axioms by strict logical deduction, with out relying on analytical means, and above all with out appeal to diagrams or to properties of the figures involved.
Thus, although in some ways he was consciously reverting to the can ons of Euclid-like proof (which by then were some what loosened), his attitude toward diagrams was fundamentally different. Aware of the potential limitations of visual iz-ing diagrams (and perhaps their misleading influence)

138

he put a much greater emphasis on the pure logical structure of the proof than his predecessors had. Nevertheless, he was not led to an out right form a list viewof geometry and geometric proof. Rather, he consistently adopted an empirical approach to the origins and meaning of geometry and fell short of claiming that diagrams were for heuristic use only: The basic propositions [of geometry] cannot be under-stood with out corresponding drawings; they express what has been observed from certain, very simple facts. The theorems are not founded on observations, but rather, they are proved.
Every inference performed dur-ing a deduction must find confirmation in a drawing, yet it is not justified by a drawing but from a certain preceding statement (or a definition). ing their central status in geometric proofs in favor of purely deductive relations, but it did not directly Pasch’s work definitely contributed to diagrams los lead to a thorough revision of the status of the axioms of geometry, or to a change in the conception that geometry deals essentially with the study of our spa-tial, visualizable intuition (in the sense of Anschauung).
The all-important nineteenth-century developments in geometry produced significant changes in the concep-tion of proof only under the combined influence of additional factors. of research, and the study of its foundations became increasingly identified with arithmetic, rather than geo-Mathematical analysis continued to be a primary field metric, rigor.
This shift was provoked by the works of mathematicians like cauchy [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857), weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897), cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), and dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916), which aimed at eliminating intuitive arguments and conceptsin favor of ever more elementary statements and definitions.
(In fact, it was not until the work of Dedekindon the foundations of arithmetic, in the last third of the century, that the rigorous formulation pursued in these works was given any kind of axiomatic under pin-ning.) The idea of investigating the axiomatic basis of mathematical theories, whether geometry, algebra, or arithmetic, and of exploring alternative possible sys-tems of postulates was indeed pursued during the nineteenth century by mathematicians such as George Peacock, Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and, in a different geographical and mathematical context, Hermann Grassmann.
But such investigations were the exception rather than the rule, and they had only a fairly limited role in shaping a new conception of proof in analysis and geometry.

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

combined to produce a new kind of approach to proof, is to be found in the works of One major turning point, where the above trends giuseppe peano [VI.62](/part-06/giuseppe-peano-18581932) and his Italian followers. Peano’s mainstream activities were as a competent analyst, but he was also interested in artificial languages, and particularly in developing an artificial language that would allow a completely formal treatment of mathematical proofs. In 1889 his successful application of such a conceptual language to arithmetic yielded his famousural numbers [III.67](/part-03/the-peano-axioms).
Pasch’s systems of axioms for postulates for the nat projective geometry posed a challenge to Peano’s arti-ficial language, and he set out to investigate the relationship between the logical and the geometric terms involved in the deductive structure of geometry. In this context he introduced the idea of an independent set of axioms, and applied this concept to his own system of axioms for projective geometry, which were a slight modification of Pasch’s. This view did not lead Peano to a formalistic conception of proof, and he still conceived geometry in terms very similar to his predecessors:
Anyone is allowed to take a hypothesis and develop its logical consequences. However, if one wants to give this work the name of geometry it is necessary that such hypotheses or postulates express the result of simple and elementary observations of physical figures. a symbolism with which to handle abstract–formal the-Under the influence of Peano, Mario Pieri developed ories.
Unlike Peano and Pasch, Pieri consistently pro-moted the idea of geometry as a purely logical system, where theorems are deduced from hypothetical premises and where the basic terms are completely detached from any empirical or intuitive significance. proof was opened at the end of the nineteenth century with the publication of A new chapter in the history of geometry and of hilbert’s [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943) Grundlagen der geometrie completion the various trends of geometric research, a work that synthesized and brought to described above.
Hilbert was able to achieve a com-prehensive analysis of the logical interrelations among the fundamental results of projective geometry, suchas the theorems of Desargues and Pappus, while paying particular attention to the role of continuity considerations within their proofs. His analysis was based on the introduction of a generalized analytic geometry, in which the coordinates may be taken from a variety of different the real numbers alone. This approach created a purely number fields [III.63](/part-03/number-fields), rather than from

II.6. The Development of the Idea of Proof

synthetic arithmetization of any given type of geom-etry, and thus helped to clarify the logical structure of Euclidean geometry as a deductive system. It also clarified the relationship between Euclidean geometry and the various other kinds of known geometries—non Euclidean, projective, or non-Archimedean. This focus on logic implied, among other things, that diagrams should be relegated to a merely heuristic role. In fact, although diagrams still appear in many proofs in the Grundlagen, the entire purpose of the logical analysis is to avoid being misled by diagrams.
Proofs, and partic-ularly geometric proofs, have thus become purely logical arguments, rather than arguments about diagrams. And at the same time, the essence and the role of the axioms from which the derivations in question start also under went a dramatic change. Following Pasch’s lead, Hilbert introduced a new system of axioms for geometry that attempted to close the logical gaps inherent in earlier systems.
These axioms were of five kinds—axioms of incidence, of order, of congruence, of parallels, and of continuity—each of which expressed a particular way in which spatial intuition manifests itself in our understanding. They were formulated for three fundamental kinds of object: points, lines, and planes. These remained undefined, and the system of axioms was meant to provide an implicit definition of them.
In other words, rather than defining points or lines at the outset and then postulating axioms that are assumed to be valid for them, a point and a line were not directly defined, except as entities that satisfy the axioms postulated by the sys-tem. Further, Hilbert demanded that the axioms in a system of this kind should be mutually independent, and introduced a method for checking that this demand is fulfilled; in order to do so, he constructed models of geometries that fail to satisfy a given axiom of the system but satisfy all the others.
Hilbert also required that the system be consistent, and that the consistency of geometry could be made to depend, in his system, on that of arithmetic. He initially assumed that prov-ing the consistency of arithmetic would not present a major obstacle and it was a long time before he realized that this was not the case. Two additional requirements that Hilbert initially introduced for axiomatic systems were simplicity and completeness.
Simplicity meant, in essence, that an axiom should not contain more than “a single idea.” The demand that every axiom in a sys-tem be “simple,” however, was never clearly defined or systematically pursued in subsequent works of Hilbert or any of his successors. The last requirement, com-

139

pleteness, meant for Hilbert in 1900 that any adequate axiomatization of a mathematical domain should allow for a derivation ofpline in question. Hilbert claimed that his axioms would all the known theorems of the disciindeed yield all the known results of Euclidean geometry, but of course this was not a property that he could formally prove. In fact, since this property of “completeness” cannot be formally checked for any given axiomatic system, it did not become one of the standard requirements of an axiomatic system.
It is important to note that the concept of completeness used by Hilbert in 1900 is completely different from the currently accepted, model-theoretical one that appeared much later. The latter amounts to the requirement that in a given axiomatic system every true statement, be it known or unknown, should be provable. The use of undefined concepts and the concomitant conception of axioms as implicit definitions gave enor-mous impetus to the view of geometry as a purely logical system, such as Pieri had devised it, and eventually transformed the very idea of truth and proof in mathe-matics.
Hilbert claimed on various occasions—echoing an idea of Dedekind—that, in his system, “points, lines, and planes” could be substituted by “chairs, tables, and beer mugs,” with out there by affecting in any sense the logical structure of the theory. More over, in the light of discussions about set-theoretical paradoxes, Hilbert strongly emphasized the view that the logical consis-tency of a concept implicitly defined by axioms was the essence of mathematical existence.
Under the influence of these views, of the new methodological tools intro-duced by Hilbert, and of the successful over view of the foundations of geometry thus achieved, many math-ematicians went on to promote new views of mathematics and new mathematical activities that in many senses went beyond the views embodied in Hilbert’sapproach. On the one hand, a trend that thrived in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, led by Eliakim H.
Moore, turned the study of systems of postulates into a mathematical field in its own right, independent of direct interest in the field of research defined by the systems in question. For instance, these mathematicians defined the minimal set of indepen-dent postulates for groups, fields, projective geometry, etc., with out then proceeding to investigate of any of these individual disciplines.
On the other hand, promi-nent mathematicians started to adopt and develop increasingly formalistic views of proof and of math-ematical truth, and began applying them in a growing number of mathematical fields. The work of the

140

radically modernist mathematician[VI.68](/part-06/felix-hausdor-18681942) provides important examples of this trend, as he felix hausdorff was among the first to consistently associate Hilbert’sa ch i eve ment with a new, formalistic view of geometry. In 1904, for instance, he wrote: In all philosophical debates since Kant, mathematics, or at least geometry, has always been treated as heteronomous, as dependent on some external instanceof what we could call, for want of a better term, intuition, be it pure or empirical, subjective or scientifically amended, innate or acquired.
The most important and fundamental task of modern mathematics has been toset itself free from this dependency, to fight its way through from heteronomy to autonomy. around 1918, when he engaged in the debates about the Hilbert himself would pursue such a point of view consistency of arithmetic and formulated his “finitist”program. This program did indeed adopt a strongly formalistic view, but it did so with the restricted aim of solving this particular problem.
It is therefore impor-tant to stress that Hilbert’s conceptions of geometry were, and remained, essentially empiricist and that he never regarded his axiomatic analysis of geometry as part of an over all formalistic conception of mathematics. He considered the axiomatic approach as a tool forthe conceptual clarification of existing, well-elaborated theories, of which geometry provided only the most prominent example.
the concept of proof and of truth in mathematics pro-voked strong reactions from some mathematicians, The implication of Hilbert’s axiomatic approach for and prominently so from are closely related to the changing status of logic at the frege [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925). Frege’s views turn of the twentieth century and its gradual process of mathematization and formalization. This process was an out come of the successive efforts through the nineteenth century of Grassmann, Charles S.
Peirce, and Ernst Schröder at boole [VI.43](/part-06/george-boole-18151864), de morgan [VI.38], formulating an algebra of logic. The most significant step toward a new, formal conception of logic, however, came with the increased understanding of the roleof the logical quantifiers [I.2 §3.2](/part-01/language-and-grammar) (universal,∀, and existential,∃) in the process of formulating a modern mathematical proof.
This understanding emerged in aninformal, but increasingly clear, fashion as part of the process of the rigorization of analysis and the distancing from visual intuition, especially at the hands of Cauchy, bolzano [VI.28](/part-06/bernard-bolzano-17811848), and Weierstrass. It was formally defined and systematically codified for the first

time by Frege in his 1879 tem, as well as similar ones proposed later by Peano Begriffsschrift. Frege’s sysand bytinction between propositional connectives and quan-russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), brought to the fore a clear distifiers, as well as between logical symbols and algebraicor arithmetic ones. which one defines in advance all the allowable sym-bols, all the rules that produce well-formed formulas, Frege formulated the idea of a formal system, in all axioms (i.e., certain preselected, well-formed formu-las), and all the rules of inference.
In such systems any deduction can be checked words, by purely symbolic means. On the basis of such syntactically—in other systems Frege aimed to produce theories with no log-ical gaps in their proofs. This would apply not only to analysis and to its arithmetic foundation—the mathe-mat ical fields that provided the original motivation for his work—but also to the new systems of geometry that were evolving at the time. On the other hand, in Frege’s view the axioms of mathematical theories—even if they appear in the formal system merely as well-formed formulas—embody truths about the world.
This is pre-cisely the source of his criticism of Hilbert. It is the truth of the axioms, asserted Frege, that certifies their consistency, rather than the other way around, as Hilbert suggested. We thus see how foundational research in two separate fields—geometry and analysis—was inspired bydifferent methodologies and philosophical out looks, but converged at the turn of the twentieth century to create an entirely new conception of mathematical proof.
In this conception a mathematical proof is seenas a purely logical construct validated in purely syntactic terms, independently of any visualization through diagrams. This conception has dominated mathematics ever since. Epilogue: Proof in the Twentieth Century The new notion of proof that stabilized at the beginningof the twentieth century provided an idealized model— broadly accepted to this day—of what should consti-tute a valid mathematical argument. To be sure, actual proofs devised and published by mathematicians since that time are seldom presented as fully formalized texts.
They typically present a clearly articulated argument in a language that is precise enough to convince the reader that it could—in principle, and perhaps with straightforward (if sustained) effort—be turned into one. Through out the decades, however, some limitations of this dominant idea have gradually emerged

and alternative conceptions of what should count as avalid mathematical argument have become increasingly accepted as part of current mathematical practice. full extent led, early on and very unexpectedly, to a serious difficulty with the notion of a proof as a com-The attempt to pursue this idea systematically to its pletely formalized and purely syntactic deductive argu-ment. In the early 1920 s, Hilbert and his collaborators developed a fully fledged mathematical theory whose subject matter was “proof,” considered as an object of study in itself.
This theory, which presupposed the for-mal conception of proof, arose as part of an ambitious program for providing a direct, finitistic consistency proof of arithmetic represented as a formalized sys-tem. Hilbert asserted that, just as the physicist examines the physical apparatus with which he carries outhis experiments and the philosopher engages in a critique of reason, so the mathematician should be able to analyze mathematical proofs and do so strictly by mathematical means.
About a decade after the program was launched, ing incompleteness theoremgödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) came up with his astonish-[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem), which famously showed that “mathematical truth” and “provability” were not one and the same thing. Indeed, in any consis-tent, sufficiently rich axiomatic system (including the systems typically used by mathematicians) there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proved.
Gödel’s work implied that Hilbert’s finitistic program was too optimistic, but at the same time it also made clear the deep mathematical insights that could be obtained from Hilbert’s proof theory. A closely related development was the emergence of proofs that certain important mathematical statements were undecidable. Interestingly, these seemingly neg-ative results have given rise to new ideas about the legitimate grounds for establishing the truth of such statements.
For instance, in 1963 Paul Cohen established that the continuum hypothesis [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory) can be neither proved nor disproved in the usual systems of axioms for set theory. Most mathematicians simply accept this idea and regard the problem as solved(even if not in the way that was originally expected), but some contemporary set theorists, notably Hugh Woodin, maintain that there are good reasons to believe that the hypothesis is false. The strategy they follow in order to justify this assertion is fundamentally differ-ent from the formal notion of proof:
they devise new axioms, demonstrate that these axioms have very desir-able properties, argue that they should therefore be accepted, and then show that they imply the negation of

the continuum hypothesis. (Seefor further discussion.) set theory [IV.22 §10](/part-04/set-theory) increasing length of significant proofs appearing in A second important challenge came from the ever various mathematical domains. A prominent example was the classification theorem for finite simple groupsarate parts by a large numbers of mathematicians.
The[V.7](/part-05/the-classication-of-finite-simple-groups), whose proof was worked out in many sep resulting arguments, if put together, would reach about ten thousand pages, and errors have been found since the announcement in the early 1980 s that the proof was complete. It has always been relatively straightforward to fix the errors and the theorem is indeed accepted and used by group theorists. Nevertheless, the notion of a proof that is too long for a single human being to check is a challenge to our conception of when a proof should be accepted as such.
The more recent, very con-spicuous cases of fermat’s last theorem [V.10](/part-05/fermats-last-theorem) and the poincaré conjecture [V.25](/part-05/the-poincar-conjecture) were hard to survey for different reasons: not only were they long (though no where near as long as the classification of finite simple groups), but they were also very difficult. In both cases there was a significant interval between the first announcement of the proofs and their complete acceptance by the mathematical community because check-ing them required enormous efforts by the very few people qualified to do so.
There is no controversy about either of these two breakthroughs, but they do raise an interesting sociological problem: if some body claims tohave proved a theorem and nobody else is prepared to check it carefully (perhaps because, unlike the two theorems just mentioned, this one is not important enough for another mathematician to be prepared to spend the time that it would take), then what is the status of the theorem? also appeared in various mathematical domains, in-clud ing number theory, group theory, and combina-Proofs based on probabilistic considerations have torics.
It is some times possible to prove mathematical statements (see, for example, the discussion of random primality testing in[IV.3 §2](/part-04/computational-number-theory)), not with complete certainty, but in such a way computational number theory that the probability of error is tiny—at most one in a trillion, say.
In such cases, we may not have a formal proof, but the chances that we are mistaken in considering the given statement to be true are probably lower than, say, the chance that there is a significant mistake in one of the lengthy proofs mentioned above. Another challenge has come from the introduction of computer-assisted methods of proof. For instance,

142

in 1976 Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken settled a famous old problem by proving the four-color theorem huge number of different map configurations, which[V.12](/part-05/the-four-color-theorem). Their proof involved the checking of a they did with the help of a computer. Initially, this raised debates about the legitimacy of their proof but it quickly became accepted and there are now several proofs of this kind. Some mathematicians even believe that computer-assisted and, more importantly, computer-generated discipline.
Under this (currently minority) view, our proofs are the future of the entire present views about what counts as an acceptable mathematical proof will soon become obsolete. ematics now contain conjectures that seem to be both fundamentally important and out of reach for the fore-A last point to stress is that many branches of math see able future. Mathematicians persuaded of the truth of such conjectures increasingly under take the systematic study of their consequences, assuming that an acceptable proof will one day appear (or at least that the conjecture is true).
Such conditional results are pub-lished in leading mathematical journals and doctoral degrees are routinely awarded for them. These trends all raise interesting questions about existing conceptions of legitimate mathematical proofs, the status of truth in mathematics, and the relationship between “pure” and “applied” fields. The formal notionof a proof as a string of symbols that obeys certain syntactical rules continues to provide an ideal model for the principles that under lie what most mathematicians see as the essence of their discipline.
It allows far-reaching mathematical analysis of the power of certain axiomatic systems, but at the same time it falls short of explaining the changing ways in which mathematicians decide what kinds of arguments they are will-ing to accept as legitimate in their actual professional practice.

Mathematics

José Ferreirós

The foundational crisis is a celebrated affair among mathematicians and it has also reached a large nonmathematical audience. A well-trained mathematician is supposed to know something about the three viewpoints called “logicism,” “formalism,” and “intuition-ism” (to be explained below), and about what gödel’s incompleteness results of mathematical knowledge.
Professional mathemat i-[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem) tell us about the status cians tend to be rather opinionated about such top-ics, either dismissing the foundational discussion as irrelevant—and thus siding with the winning party—or defending, either as a matter of principle or as an intriguing option, some form of revisionist approachto mathematics. But the real out lines of the historical debate are not well-known and the subtler philo-so phical issues at stake are often ignored.
Here we shall mainly discuss the former, in the hope that this will help bring the main conceptual issues into sharper focus. The foundational crisis is usually understood as a relatively localized event in the 1920 s, a heated debate between the partisans of “classical” (meaning late-nineteenth-century) mathematics, led byand their critics, led by brouwer [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966), who advo-hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), cated strong revision of the received doctrines.
There is, however, a second, and in my opinion very important, sense in which the “crisis” was a long and global process, in distinguishable from the rise of modern mathematics and the philosophical and methodologi-cal issues it created. This is the standpoint from which the present account has been written. Within this longer process one can still pick out some noteworthy intervals. Around 1870 there were many discussions about the acceptability of non-Euclidean geometries, and also about the proper foundations of complex analysis and even the real numbers.
Early in the twentieth century there were debates about set theory, about the concept of the continuum, and about the role of logic and the axiomatic method versus

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics the role of intuition. By about 1925 there was a cri-sis in the proper sense, during which the main opinions in these debates were developed and turned into detailed mathematical research projects. And in the 1930 s gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness results, which could not be assimilated with out some cherished beliefs being abandoned. Let us analyze some of these events and issues in greater detail.
1 Early Foundational Questions There is evidence that in 1899 Hilbert endorsed the viewpoint that came to be known as logicism. Logicism was the thesis that the basic concepts of mathemat-ics are definable by means of logical notions, and that the key principles of mathematics are deducible from logical principles alone. Over time this thesis has become unclear, based as it seems to be on a fuzzy and immature conception of the scope of logical theory.
But historically speaking logicism was a neat intellectual reaction to the rise of mod-ern mathematics, and particularly to the set-theoretic approach and methods. Since the majority opinion was that set theory is just a part of (refined) logic,1 this thesis was thought to be supported by the fact that the theories of natural and real numbers can be derived from set theory, and also by the increasingly important role of set-theoretic methods in algebra and in real and complex analysis. he understood mathematics.
For us, the essence of Hilbert’s and Dedekind’s early logicism is their self-Hilbert was following dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) in the way conscious endorsement of certain modern methods, however daring they seemed at the time. These methods had emerged gradually during the nineteenth cen-tury, and were particularly associated with Göttingen mathematics (they experienced a crucial turning point with gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and dirichlet [VI.36]);

Mathematicians in disagreed (see Ferreirós 1999). The “majority” included Dedekind, peano1. One should mention that key figures like Riemann and Cantor[VI.62](/part-06/giuseppe-peano-18581932), Hilbert, russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), and others.

Paris and elsewhere also harbored doubts about these new and radical ideas. proach were: The most characteristic traits of the modern ap(i) acceptance of the notion of an “arbitrary” function proposed by Dirichlet; (ii) a wholehearted acceptance of infinite sets and the higher infinite; (iii) a preference “to put thoughts in the place of calculations” (Dirichlet), and to concentrate on (iv) a frequent reliance on “purely existential” meth-“structures” characterized axiomatically; andods of proof.
An early and influential example of these traits was Dedekind’s approach (1871) to theory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)—his set-theoretic definition ofalgebraic number number fields by which he proved results such as the fund a men-[III.63](/part-03/number-fields) and ideals [III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules), and the methods tal theorem of unique decomposition. In a remark-able departure from the number-theoretic tradition, Dedekind studied the factorization properties of alge-braic integers in terms of ideals, which are certain infinite sets of algebraic integers.
Using this new abstract concept, together with a suitable definition of the product of two ideals, Dedekind was able to prove infull generality that, within any ring of algebraic integers, ideals possess a unique decomposition into prime ideals. Dedekind’s proofs do not enable us to calculate, ina particular case, the relevant divisors or ideals: that The influential algebraist Kronecker complained that is, the proof waswas that this abstract way of working, made possible purely existential .

But for Dedekind he had succeeded in elaborating the principle “to put thoughts in the place of calculations,” a principle that was also emphasized in Riemann’s theory of complex functions.

But he also insisted on the importance of a general, conceptual theory. became better known through publications of the pe-riod 1867–72.

Exercising his famous critical abilities, Weierstrass offered examples of continuous functions that were no where differentiable. It is worth mentioning that, in preferring infinite series as the key means for research in analysis and function theory, Weierstrass remained closer to the old eighteenth-century idea of a function as an ana-lyt ical expression. On the other hand, Riemann and Dedekind were always in favor of Dirichlet’s abstract idea of a function$f$as an “arbitrary” way of associating with each$x some y = f (x)$.

Hilbert and Kneser would later reformulate and justify the principle.

an “obvious sophism,” promising that he would offer counterexamples. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, which states that an infinite bounded set of real numbers has an accumulation point, was a cornerstone of classical analysis, and was emphasized as such by Weierstrass in his famous Berlin lectures. The problem for Kronecker was that this theorem rests entirely on the completeness axiom for the real numbers (which, in one version, states that every sequence of nonempty nested closed intervals in R has a nonempty intersection).
The real numbers cannot be constructed in an elementary way from the rational numbers: one has to make heavy use of infinite sets (such as the set ofall possible “Dedekind cuts,” which are subsets C ⊂ Q such that bers such thatp \in  Cp < qwhe never and pq and\in  C). To put it a not herq are rational num- way: Kronecker was drawing attention to the problem that, very often, the accumulation point in the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem cannot be constructed by elemen-tary operations from the rational numbers.
The classical idea of the set of real numbers, or “the continuum,”already contained the seeds of the nonconstructive ingredient in modern mathematics. ant theory led to a debate about his purely exist en-tial proof of another basic result, the Later on, in around 1890, Hilbert’s work on invari-basis theorem, which states (in modern terminology) that every ideal in a polynomial ring is finitely generated. Paul Gordan, famous as the “king” of invariants for his heavily algorithmic work on the topic, remarked humorously that this was “theology,” not mathematics!
(He appar-ently meant that, because the proof was purely existential, rather than constructive, it was comparable with philosophical proofs of the existence of God.)This early foundational debate led to a gradual clarification of the opposing viewpoints. Cantor’s proofs inset theory also became quintessential examples of the modern methodology of existential proof. He offered an explicit defense of the higher infinite and modern methods in a paper of 1883, which was peppered with hidden attacks on Kronecker’s views.
Kronecker in turn criticized Dedekind’s methods publicly in 1882, spoke privately against Cantor, and in 1887 published an attempt to spell out his foundational views. dedekind replied with a detailed set-theoretic (and “thus,” for him, logicistic) theory of the natural numbers in 1888.The early round of criticism ended with an apparent victory for the modern camp, which enrolled new and powerful allies such as Hurwitz, Hilbert, Volterra, Peano, and hadamard minkowski[VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), and[VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909),

Although Riemannian function theory was still klein in need of further refinement, recent developments in real analysis, number theory, and other fields were showing the power and promise of the modern meth-ods. During the 1890 s, the modern viewpoint in general, and logicism in particular, enjoyed great expan-sion.

These were of two Then, dramatically, came the so-called logical par a kinds. On the one hand, there were arguments show-ing that assumptions that certain sets exist lead to contradictions. These were later called the paradoxes.
On the other, there were arguments, later set-theoretic known as the difficulties with the notions of truth and definability.semantic paradoxes, which showed up These paradoxes completely destroyed the attractive view of recent developments in mathematics that had been proposed by logicism. Indeed, the heyday of logi-cism came before the paradoxes, that is, before 1900; it subsequently enjoyed a revival with Russell and his“theory of types,” but by 1920 logicism was of interest more to philosophers than to mathematicians.
How-ever, the divide between advocates of the modern methods and constructivist critics of these methods was there to stay. 2 Around 1900 Hilbert opened his famous list of mathematical prob-lems at the Paris International Congress of Mathematics of 1900 with Cantor’sa key question in set theory, and with the problem continuum problem [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), of whether every set can be well-ordered. His second problem amounted to establishing the consistency of the notion of the set R of real numbers. It was not by chance that he began with these problems:
rather, itwas a way of making a clear statement about how mathematics should be in the twentieth century. Those two problems, and the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) employed by Hilbert’s young colleague Zermelo to show that R (the examples of the traits (i)–(iv) that were listed above. Itcontinuum) can be well-ordered, are quintessential is little wonder that less daring minds objected and revived Kronecker’s doubts, as can be seen in many publications of 1905–6. This brings us to the next stage of the debate.

2.1 Paradoxes and Consistency

In a remarkable turn of events, the champions of mod-ern mathematics stumbled upon arguments that cast new doubts on its cogency. In around 1896, Cantor discovered that the seemingly harmless concepts of theset of all ordinals and the set of all cardinals led to contradictions. In the former case the contradiction is usually called thethe Cantor paradox. The assumption that all transfi-Burali-Forti paradox; the latter is nite ordinals form a set leads, by Cantor’s previous results, to the result that there is an ordinal that is less than itself—and similarly for cardinals.
Upon learning of these paradoxes, Dedekind began to doubt whether human thought is completely rational. Even worse, in 1901–2 Zermelo and Russell discovered a very elemen-tary contradiction, now known as Russell’s paradox or some times as the Zermelo–Russell paradox, which will be discussed in a moment. The untenability of the previous understanding of set theory as logic became clear, and there began a new period of instability. But it should be said that only logicists were seriously up set by these arguments: they were presented with contradictions in their theories.
Let us explain the importance of the Zermelo–Russell paradox. From Riemann to Hilbert, many authors ac-cepted the principle that, given any well-defined logical or mathematical property, there exists a set of all objects satisfying that property. In symbols: given awell-defined proper typ, there exists another object, the set{x}: p(x). For example, corresponding to the property of “being a real number” (which is expressed formally by Hilbert’s axioms) there is the set of all real numbers; corresponding to the property of “being an ordinal” there is the set of all ordinals; and so on.
This is called thethe basis for the logicistic understanding of set theory, comprehension principle, and it constitutes often called naive set theory, although its naivete is only clear with hindsight. The principle was thought of as a basic logical law, so that all of set theory was merely a part of elementary logic. The Zermelo–Russell paradox shows that the comprehension principle is contradictory, and it does soby formulating a property that seems to be as basic and purely logical as possible.
Let ert yx ∉ x (bearing in mind that negation and mem-p(x) be the prop- ber ship were assumed to be purely logical concepts).The comprehension principle yields the existence of the set$R = {x}$: x ∉ x, but this leads quickly to a contradiction: if$R \in R$, then R ∉ R(by the definition 146 of R), and similarly, if R ∉ R, then R \in R. Hilbert (like his older colleague logicism, and even wondered whether Kronecker might frege [VI.56](/part - 06/gottlob - frege - 18481925)) was led to abandon have been right all along.
Eventually he concluded that set theory had shown the need to refine logical theory. It was also necessary to establish set theory axiomatically, as a basic ematical (not logical) axioms, and Zermelo under took mathematical theory based on math this task. Hilbert famously advocated that to claim that a set of mathematical objects exists is tantamount to proving that the corresponding axiom system is consistent— that is, free of contradictions. The documentary evi-dence suggests that Hilbert came to this celebrated principle in reaction to Cantor’s paradoxes.
His rea-soning may have been that, instead of jumping directly from well-defined concepts to their corresponding sets, one had first to prove that the concepts are logically consistent. For example, before one could accept the set of all real numbers, one should prove the consistency of Hilbert’s axiom system for them. Hilbert’s principle was a way of removing any metaphysical content from the notion of mathematical existence.
This view, that mathematical objects had a sort of “ideal existence” inthe realm of thought rather than an independent metaphysical existence, had been anticipated by Dedekind and Cantor. that go by the names of Burali - Forti, Cantor, and Rus - The “logical” paradoxes included not only the ones sell, but also many semantic paradoxes formulated by Russell, Richard, König, Grelling, etc. (Richard’s paradox will be discussed below.) Much confusion emerged from the abundance of different paradoxes, but one thing is clear:
they played an important role in promot-ing the development of modern logic and convincing mathematicians of the need for strictly formal presen-tation of their theories. Only when a theory has been stated within a precise formal language can one disre-gard the semantic paradoxes, and even formulate the distinction between these and the set-theoretic ones.
2.2 Predicativity When the books of Frege and Russell made the para-doxes of set theory widely known to the mathematical community in 1903, forward criticisms of both logicism and formalism.poincaré [VI.61](/part - 06/jules - henri - poincar - 18541912) used them to put His analysis of the paradoxes led him to coin an important new notion, impredicative definitions should be avoided in mathe - predicativity, and maintain that matics. Informally, a definition is impredicative when II.
The Origins of Modern Mathematics it introduces an element by reference to a totality that already contains that element. A typical example is the following: Dedekind defines the set N of natural numbers as the intersection of all sets that contain1 and are closed under an injective functionσ such$that 1 function$∉.) His idea was to characterizeσ (N). (The function σ is called the N as minimal, success or but in his procedure the set N is first introduced by appeal to a totality of sets that should already include N itself.
This kind of procedure appeared unacceptable to Poincaré (and also to Russell), especially when the relevant object can be specified only by reference to the more embracing totality. Poincaré found examplesof impredicative procedures in each of the paradoxes he studied. Take, for instance, Richard’s paradox, which is one of the linguistic or semantic paradoxes (where, as wesaid, the notions of truth and definability are prominent). One begins with the idea ofbers.
Because definitions must be expressed in a certain definable real num language by finite expressions, there are only count-ably many definable numbers. Indeed, we can explicitly count the definable real numbers by listing them in alphabetical order of their definitions. (This is known as theto this list a diagonal process, of the kind used by Can-lexicographic order.) Richard’s idea was to apply tor to prove that R is not countable [III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets). Let the definable numbers beberr in a systematic way, making sure that thea1$, a2$, a3, . . ..
Define a new num-$nth$ decimal digit of digit of$an$. (For example, let theris different from thenth digit ofnth deci malr be 2 unless thenth digit ofnrth digit ofbe 4.) Thenan ris 2, in which case let the can not belong to the set of definable numbers. But in the course of this con-struc tion, the number$r$has just been defined in finitely many words!
Poincaré would ban impredicative definitions and would therefore prevent the introduction ofthe number r, since it was defined with reference to the totality of all definable numbers.3 ematics, all mathematical objects (beyond the natural numbers) must be introduced by explicit definitions. In this kind of approach to the foundations of math If a definition refers to a presumed totality of which the object being defined is itself a member, we are involved in a circle: the object itself is then a con-stituent of its own definition.
In this view, “definitions” within a well-determined formal theory, whose language and expres-sions are fixed to begin with. Richard’s paradox takes advantage of an3. The modern solution is to establish mathematical definitions ambiguity as to what the available means of definition are.

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics must be predicative: one refers only to totalities that have already been established before the object one is defining. Important authors such as Russell and weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) accepted this point of view and developed it. Zermelo was not convinced, arguing that impredicative definitions were often used unproblematical ly, not only in set theory (as in Dedekind’s definition of N, for example), but also in classical analysis.
As a particular example, he cited cauchy’s [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) proof of the fun[V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra),4 but a simdamental theorem of algebrapler example of impredicative definition is the least upper bound in real analysis. The real numbers arenot introduced separately, by explicit predicative definitions of each one of them; rather, they are introduced as a completed whole, and the particular way in which the least upper bound of an infinite bounded set of reals is singled out becomes impredicative.
But Zermelo insisted that these definitions are innocuous, because the object being defined is not “created” by the definition; it is merely singled out (see his paper of 1908 invan Heijenoort (1967, pp. 183–98)). tions became important for Russell, who incorporated it as the “vicious circle principle” in his influential Poincaré’s idea of abolishing impredicative de fin i theory of types logic, with quantification over properties or sets, over. Type theory is a system of higher-order relations, over sets of sets, and so on.
Roughly speaking, it is based on the idea that the elements of anyset should always be objects of a certain homogeneous type. For instance, we can have sets of “individuals,”such as\\{a}, b\\}, or sets of sets of individuals, such as{{a}}$, \\\{a, b\\\}$, but never a “mixed” set like{a}$, \\\{a, b\\\}$. Russell’s version of type theory became rather complicated because of the so-called ramification he adopted in order to avoid impredicativity.
This system, together with axioms of infinity, choice, and “reducibility” (a surprisingly ad hoc means to “collapse” the ramification), sufficed for the development of set theory and the number systems. Thus it became the logical basis forthe renowned Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell (1910–13), in which they carefully developed afoundation for mathematics. about 1930, but under the form of Type theory remained the main logical system until simple type theory tential” as we have been saying.

Ramsey proposed arguments that ity, and he tried to justify the other existence axioms of choice—as logical principles. But his arguments were Principia—the axiom of infinity and the axiom of inconclusive. Russell’s attempt to rescue logicism from the paradoxes remained unconvincing, except to some philosophers (especially members of the Vienna Circle).Poincaré’s suggestions also became a key principle for the interesting foundational approach proposed by Weyl in his book Das Kontinuum (1918).
The main idea was to accept the theory of the natural numbers as they were conventionally developed using classical logic, but to work predicatively from there on. Thus, unlike Brouwer, Weyl accepted the principle of the excluded middle. (This, and Brouwer’s views, will be discussed inthe next section.) However, the full system of the real numbers was not available to him:
in his system the set R was not complete and the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem failed, which meant that he had to devise sophisti-cated replacements for the usual derivations of results in analysis. The idea of predicative foundations for mathematics, in the style of Weyl, has been carefully developed in recent decades with noteworthy results (see Feferman 1998). Predicative systems lie between those that coun-tenance all of the modern methodology and the more stringent constructivist ic systems.
This is one of sev-eral foundational approaches that do not fit into the conventional but by now outdated triad of logicism, formalism, and intuitionism. 2.3 Choices As important as the paradoxes were, their impact onthe foundational debate has often been over stated. One frequently finds accounts that take the paradoxes asthe real starting point of the debate, in strong contrast with our discussion in section 1. But even if werestrict our attention to the first decade of the twentieth century, there was another controversy of equal, if not greater, importance:
the arguments that surrounded the axiom of choice and Zermelo’s proof ofthe well-ordering theorem. sets and their defining properties was at the time Recall from section 2.1 that the association between deeply ingrained in the minds of mathematicians and logicians (via the contradictory principle of comprehension). The axiom of choice (AC) is the principle that, 148 given any infinite family of disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set, known as a choice set, that contains exactly one element from each set in the family.
The problem with this, said the critics, is that it merely stipulates the existence of the choice set and does not give a defining property for it. Indeed, when it is possible to characterize the choice set explicitly, then theuse of AC is avoidable! But in the case of Zermelo’s well-ordering theorem it is essential to employ AC.
The required well-ordering of R “exists” in the ideal sense of Cantor, Dedekind, and Hilbert, but it seemed clear thatit was completely out of reach from any constructivist perspective. Thus, the axiom of choice exacerbated obscurities in previous conceptions of set theory, forcing mathemat i-cians to introduce much - needed clarifications. On the one hand, AC was nothing but an explicit statementof previous views about arbitrary subsets, and yet, on the other, it obviously clashed with strongly held views about the need to explicitly define infinite sets by properties.
The stage was set for deep debate. The discus-sions about this particular topic contributed more than anything else to a clarification of the existential impli-ca tions of modern mathematical methods. It is instructive to know that[VI.72](/part - 06/henri - lebesgue - 18751941), who became critics, had all relied on AC in less borel [VI.70](/part - 06/emile - borel - 18711956), Baire, and lebesgue obvious ways in order to prove theorems of analysis.
Not by chance, the axiom was suggested to Zermelo by an analyst, Erhard Schmidt, who was a student of Hilbert.5 debate developed through out Europe.
Zermelo was spurred on to work out the foundations of set theory After the publication of Zermelo’s proof, an intense in an attempt to show that his proof could be devel-oped within an unexceptionable axiom system. The out come was his famous axiom system [IV.22 §3](/part - 04/set - theory), a masterpiece that emerged from careful analysis of set theory as it was historically given in the contributions of Cantor and Dedekind and in Zermelo’s own theo - rem.

In particular, it includes strong existence principles, allows impredicative def-initions and arbitrary functions, warrants purely existential proofs, and makes it possible to define the main mathematical structures. It thus exhibits all the ten - dencies (i)–(iv) mentioned in section 1. Zermelo’s own work was completely in line with Hilbert’s in formal axiomatizations of about 1900, and he did not forget to promise a proof of consistency.
Axiomatic set theory, whether in the Zermelo–Fraenkel presentation or the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel version, is the system that most mathematicians regard as the working foundation for their discipline. As of 1910, the contrast between Russell’s type theory and Zermelo’s set theory was strong. The for-mer system was developed within formal logic, and its point of departure (albeit later compromised for prag-matic reasons) was in line with predicativism;
in order to derive mathematics, the system needed the existential assumptions of infinity and choice, but these were rhetorically treated as tentative hypotheses rather than out right axioms. The latter system was presented infor - mally, adopted the impredicative standpoint wholeheartedly, and asserted as axioms strong existential assumptions that were sufficient to derive all of classi-cal mathematics and Cantor’s theory of the higher infinite. In the 1920 s the separation diminished greatly, especially with respect to the first two traits just indicated.
Zermelo’s system was perfected and formulated within the language of modern formal logic. And the Russellians adopted simple type theory, thus accepting the impredicative and “existential” methodology of modern mathematics. This is often given the (potentially confusing) term “Platonism”:
the objects that the theory refers to are treated of what the mathematician can actually and explicitly as if they were independent define. Meanwhile, back in the first decade of the twentieth century, a young mathematician in the Netherlands was beginning to find his way toward a philosophically col-ored version of constructivism. Brouwer presented his strikingly peculiar metaphysical and ethical views in1905, and started to elaborate a corresponding foundation for mathematics in his thesis of 1907.
His philosophy of “intuitionism” derived from the old metaphys-ical view that individual consciousness is the one and II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics only source of knowledge. This philosophy is perhaps of little interest in itself, so we shall concentrate here on Brouwer’s constructivist ic principles. In the years around 1910, Brouwer became a renowned mathematician, with crucial contributions to topology such as his fixed point theorem [V.11](/part - 05/fixed - point - theorems).
By the end of World War I, he started to publish detailed elaborations of his foun-dational ideas, helping to create the famous “crisis,” to which we now turn. He was also successful in establishing the customary (but misleading) distinction between formalism and intuitionism. 3 The Crisis in a Strict Sense In 1921, the paper by Weyl in which the famous mathematician, who Mathematische Zeitschrift published a was a disciple of Hilbert, openly espoused intuitionism and diagnosed a “crisis in the foundations” of mathematics.
The crisis pointed toward a “dissolution” ofthe old state of analysis, by means of Brouwer’s “revolution.” Weyl’s paper was meant as a propaganda pam-phlet to rouse the sleepers, and it certainly did. Hilbert answered in the same year, accusing Brouwer and Weylof attempting a “putsch” aimed at establishing “dictatorship à la Kronecker” (see the relevant papers in Mancosu (1998) and van Heijenoort (1967)).
The foun-dational debate shifted dramatically toward the battle between Hilbert’s attempts to justify “classical” math-ematics and Brouwer’s developing reconstruction of a much - reformed intuitionistic mathematics. Why was Brouwer “revolutionary”? Up to 1920 the key foundational issues had been the acceptability ofthe real numbers and, more fundamentally, of the impredicativity and strong existential assumptions of set theory, which supported the higher infinite andthe unrestricted use of existential proofs.
Set theory and, by implication, classical analysis had been crit-icized for their reliance on impredicative definitions and for their strong existential assumptions (in par - ticular, the axiom of choice, of which extensive use was made by sierpi ́nski [VI.77](/part - 06/wacaw - sierpinski - 18821969) in 1918). Thus, the debate in the first two decades of the twentieth cen-tury was mainly about which principles to accept when it came to defining and establishing the exis-tence of sets and subsets. A key question was, can one make rigorous the vague idea behind talk of “arbi-trary subsets”?
The most coherent reactions had been Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory and Weyl’s predicative system in Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell was an unsuc-Das Kontinuum. (The Principia 149 cessful compromise between predicativism and classi-cal mathematics.) questions to the fore. No one had questioned the tra-dition al ways of reasoning about the natural numbers: Brouwer, however, brought new and even more basic classical logic, in particular the use of quantifiers andthe principle of the excluded middle, had been used in this context with out hesitation.
But Brouwer put for-ward principled critiques of these assumptions and started developing an alternative theory of analysis that was much more radical than Weyl’s. In doing so, he came upon a new theory of the continuum, which finally enticed Weyl and made him announce the coming of a new age. 3.1 Intuitionism Brouwer began systematically developing his views with two papers on “intuitionistic set theory,” written in German and published in 1918 and 1919 bythe Verhandelingen of the Dutch Academy of Sciences. These contributions were part of what he regarded asthe “Second Act” of intuitionism.
The “First Act” (from 1907) had been his emphasis on the intuitive founda-tions of mathematics. Already Klein and Poincaré had insisted that intuition has an inescapable role to play in mathematical knowledge: as important as logic is in proofs and in the development of mathematical theory, mathematics cannot be reduced to pure logic; theories and proofs are of course organized logically, but their basic principles (axioms) are grounded in intuition. But Brouwer went beyond them and insisted on the absolute independence of mathematics from language and logic.

PEM is the logical principle that the statementp ∨ ¬p (that is, either p or not p) must always be true, whatever the proposition(For example, it follows from PEM that either the deci-p may be.
mal expansion ofit contains only finitely many sevens, even though weπcontains infinitely many sevens or do not have a proof of which.) Brouwer held that our customary logical principles were abstracted from the way we dealt with subsets of a finite set, and that itwas wrong to apply them to infinite sets as well. After World War I he started the systematic reconstruction of mathematics. or The intuitionist position is that one can only state “$q$” when one can give either a constructive proof of$p$

pc on sequence that proofs by contradiction (or a constructive proof of q. This standpoint has the reductio ad absurdumof his basis theorem (section 1), achieved by) are not valid. Consider Hilbert’s first proof reductio: he showed that one can derive a contradiction from the assumption that the basis is infinite, and from this he concluded that the basis is finite. The logic behind this procedure is that we start from a concrete instance of PEM, p ∨ ¬p, show that ¬p is untenable, and conclude that for exp li citp must be true.
But constructive mathematics asks procedures for constructing each object that is assumed to exist, and explicit constructions behind any mathematical statement. Similarly, we have mentioned before (section 2.1) Cauchy’s proof of the fun-da mental theorem of algebra, as well as many proofs in real analysis that invoke the least upper bound. All of these proofs are in valid for a constructivist, and several mathematicians have tried to save the theoremsby finding constructivist proofs for them.
For instance, both Weyl and Kneser worked on constructivist proofs for the fundamental theorem of algebra. It is easy to give instances of the use of PEM that a constructivist will not accept: one just has to apply itto any unsolved mathematical problem. For example, Catalan’s constant is the number. nfty - n K = n = 0 (2(n + 1)1)2. It is not known whether the statement “Catalan’s constant is transcendental,”K is transcendental, so if p is then a constructivist will not accept thatp is either true or false.
one realizes that constructivists have a different view about what truth This may seem odd, or even obviously wrong, until is. For a constructivist, to say that a proposition is true simply means that we can prove it in accordance with the stringent methods that we are discussing; to say that it is false means that we can actually exhibit a counterexample to it. Since there isno reason to suppose that every existence statement has either a strict constructivist proof or an explicit counterexample, there is no reason to believe PEM (with this notion of truth).
Thus, in order to establish the existence of a natural number with a certain prop - erty, a proof by reductio ad absurdum is not enough. Existence must be shown by explicit determination or construction if you want to persuade a constructivist. Notice also how this viewpoint implies that mathematics is not time less or ahistorical. It was only in1882 that Lindemann proved thatπ is a transcenden - II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics tal numbersible to assign a truth value to statements that were[III.41](/part - 03/irrational - and-\text{transcendental} - numbers).
Since that date, it has been pos neither true nor false before, according to intuition-ists. This may seem paradoxical, but it was just right for Brouwer, since in his view mathematical objects are mental constructions and he rejected as “metaphysics” the assumption that they have an independent existence.
Zermelo by constructive counterparts, which he would In 1918, Brouwer replaced the sets of Cantor and later call “spreads” and “species.” Aa set that has been defined by a characteristic prop-species is basically erty, but with the proviso that previously and independently defined by an explicit every element has been construction. In particular, the definition of any given species will be strictly predicative. tic of intuitionism, and it forms the basis for Brouwer’s The concept of a spread is particularly character is definition of the continuum.
It is an attempt to avoid idealization and do justice to the temporal nature of mathematical constructions. Suppose, for example, that we wish to define a sequence of rational numbers that gives better and better approximations to the square root of 2. In classical analysis, one con-ceives of such sequences as existing in their entirety, but Brouwer defined a notion that he called a sequence, which pays more attention to how they might choice be produced.
One way to produce them is to give a rule, such as the recurrence relation$x = (x2 + 2)/2x$ (and the initial condition make less rigidly determined choices that obey certain$x^{1} = 2)$. But another is to^n^+^1^n^n constraints: for instance, one might insist that denominator$n \text{and that} x^{2}$differs from 2 by at most$x^{n} has$ 100 ensure that the sequence produces better and better/n, which does not determinen xn uniquely but does approximations to$\sqrt{2}$.
A choice sequence is therefore not required to be completely specified from the outset, and it can involve choices that are freely made by the mathematician at different moments in time. Both these features make choice sequences very different from the sequences of classical analysis: it has been said that intuitionist mathematics is “mathematics in the making.” By con-trast, classical mathematics is marked by a kind of time less objectivity, since its objects are assumed tobe fully determined in themselves and independent of the thinking processes of mathematicians.
A spread has choice sequences as its elements—it is something like a law that regulates how the sequences

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics are constructed.6 For instance, one could take a spread that consisted of all choice sequences that began insome particular way, and such a spread would represent a segment—in general, spreads do not represent isolated elements, but continuous domains. By using spreads whose elements satisfy the Cauchy condition, Brouwer offered a new mathematical conception of the continuum:
rather than being made up of points (or real numbers) with some previous Platonic existence, it was more genuinely “continuous.” Interestingly, this view is reminiscent of Aristotle, who, twenty-three centuries earlier, had emphasized the priority of the continuum and rejected the idea that an extended continuum canbe made up of unextended points. sis was to analyze the idea of a function. brouwer defined a function to be an assignment of values to the The next stage in Brouwer’s redevelopment of an a ly elements of a spread.
However, because of the nature of spreads, this assignment had to be wholly dependent on an initial segment of the choice sequence in order to be constructively admissible. This threw up a big surprise: all functions that are every where defined are continuous (and even uniformly continuous). What, you might wonder, about the function whenx < 0 and f (x) = 1 when xf⩾where0? For Brouwer, f (x) = 0 this is not a well-defined function, and the underlying reason for this is that one can determine spreads for which we do not know (and may never know) whether they are positive, zero, or negative.
For instance, one could let2 n are sums of two primes, andxn be 1 if all the even numbers between 4 and - 1 otherwise. tic negation differs in meaning from classical negation. Thus, intuitionistic arithmetic is also different from The rejection of PEM has the effect that intuition is classical arithmetic. Nevertheless, in 1933 Gödel and Gentzen were able to show that the dedekind–peano axioms formalized intuitionistic arithmetic.
(That is, they were[III.67](/part - 03/the - peano - axioms) of arithmetic are consistent relative to able to establish a correspondence between the sen-tences of both formal systems, such that a contradiction in classical arithmetic yields a contradiction in its intuitionistic counterpart; thus, if the latter is consistent, the former must be as well.) This was a small triumph for the Hilbertians, though corresponding proofs Heyting (1956), or more recently van Atten (2003), for further details on this and other points. One can picture a spread as a subtree of the6.
More precisely, a spread is defined by means of two laws; see universal tree of natural numbers (consisting of all finite sequences of natural numbers), together with an assignment of previously available mathematical objects to the nodes. One law of the spread determines nodes in the tree, the other maps them to objects. 151 for systems of analysis or set theory have never been found. ment of intuitionism would end in a simple and ele-Initially there had been hopes that the developgant presentation of pure mathematics.
However, as Brouwer’s reconstruction developed in the 1920 s, it became more and more clear that intuitionistic analysis was extremely complicated and foreign. Brouwer was not worried, for, as he would say in 1933, “the spheres of truth are less transparent than those of illusion.” But Weyl, although convinced that Brouwer had delineated the domain of mathematical intuition in a completely satisfactory way, remarked in 1925:
“the mathematician watches with pain the largest part of his tower-ing theories dissolve into mist before his eyes.” Weyl seems to have abandoned intuitionism shortly there - after. Fortunately, there was an alternative approach that suggested another way of rehabilitating classical mathematics. 3.2 Hilbert’s Program This alternative approach was, of course, Hilbert’s pro - gram, which promised, in the memorable phrasing of 1928, “to eliminate from the world once and for all the skeptical doubts” as to the acceptability of the classical theories of mathematics.
The new perspective, which he started to develop in 1904, relied heavily on formal logic and a combinatorial study of the formulas that are provable from given formulas (the axioms). With modern logic, proofs are turned into formal computations that can be checked mechanically, so that the process is purely constructivist ic. it is interesting that the new project was to employ Kronecker i an means for a justification of modern, anti-In the light of our previous discussion (section 1), Kronecker i an methodology.
Hilbert’s aim was to show that it is impossible to prove a contradictory formula from the axioms. Once this had been shown combina-tori ally or constructively (or, as Hilbert also said, finitarily), the argument can be regarded as a justification of the axiom system—even if we read the axioms as talking about non-Kronecker i an objects like the real numbers or transfinite sets. Still, Hilbert’s ideas at the time were marred by a deficient understanding of logical theory.7 It was only in 1917–18 that Hilbert returned to this topic, now with of 1879 or Peano’s of the 1890 s.
We do not enter into the development of logical theory in this period (see, for example, Moore 1998).7. The logic he presented in 1905 lagged far behind Frege’s system 152 a refined understanding of logical theory and a greater awareness of the considerable technical difficulties of his project. Other mathematicians played very signif-icant parts in promoting this better understanding.
By 1921, helped by his assistant Bernays, Hilbert had arrived at a very refined conception of the formalization of mathematics, and had perceived the need for a deeper and more careful probing into the logical structure of mathematical proofs and theories. His program was first clearly formulated in a talk at Leipzig late in 1922.Here we will describe the mature form of Hilbert’s program, as it was presented for instance in the 1925 paper “On the infinite” (see van Heijenoort 1967).
The main goal was to establish, by means of syntactic con-sistency proofs, the logical acceptability of the principles and modes of inference of modern mathematics. Axiomatics, logic, and formalization made it possible to study mathematical theories from a purely mathe-mat ical standpoint (hence the name metamathematics), and Hilbert hoped to establish the consistency of the theories by employing very weak means.
In particular, Hilbert hoped to answer all of the criticisms of Weyl and Brouwer, and there by justify set theory, the classical theory of real numbers, classical analysis, and of course classical logic with its PEM (the basis for in direct proofs by The whole point of Hilbert’s approach was to make reductio ad absurdum). mathematical theories fully precise, so that it would become possible to obtain precise results about their properties. The following steps are indispensable forthe completion of such a program.

(iv) Ashows that it is impossible for a string of symbols finitary study of the formalized proofs of T that that expresses a contradiction to be the last line of a proof. In fact, steps (ii) and (iii) can be solved with rather sim-ple systems formalized in first-order logic, like those II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics studied in any introduction to mathematical logic, suchas Dedekind–Peano arithmetic or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.
It turns out that first-order logic is enough for codifying mathematical proofs, but, interestingly, this realization came rather late—after[V.15](/part - 05/gdels - theorem). gödel’s theorems formalized, any proof becomes a Hilbert’s main insight was that, when theories are finite combinatorial object: it is just an array of strings of symbols com-plying with the formal rules of the system. As Bernays said, this was like “projecting” the deductive structureof a theory T into the number-theoretic domain, and it became possible to express in this domain the consis-tency of T.
These realizations raised hopes that a finitary study of formalized proofs would suffice to estab-lish the consistency of the theory, that is, to prove the sentence expressing the consistency ofnot warranted by the previous insights, turned out to T . But this hope, be wrong.8 that not only the logical calculus but also each of the axiomatic systems would be Also, a crucial presupposition of the program was complete.
Roughly speaking, this means that they would be sufficiently power-ful to allow the derivation of all the relevant results.9 This assumption turned out to be wrong for systems that contain (primitive recursive) arithmetic, as Gödel showed. It remains to say a bit more about what Hilbert meant bythe points in which his program of the 1920 s adopted finitism (for details, see Tait 1981). This is one of to some extent the principles of intuitionists such as Poincaré and Brouwer and deviated strongly from the ideas Hilbert himself had considered in 1900.
The key idea is that, contrary to the views of logicists like Frege and Dedekind, logic and pure thought require something that is given “intuitively” in our immediate experience: the signs and formulas. In 1905, Poincaré had put forth the view that a formal consistency proof for arithmetic would be circu-lar, as such a demonstration would have to proceed by induction on the length of formulas and proofs, and thus would rely on the same axiom of induction that it was supposed to establish.
Hilbert replied in the 1920 sthat the form of induction required at the meta mathematical level is much weaker than full arithmetical induction, and that this weak form is grounded on the

8. For further details, see, for example, Sieg (1999).9. The notion of “relevant result” should of course be made precise: doing so leads to the notion either of syntactic completeness or ofsemantic completeness.

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics finitary consider at i on of signs that he took to be intu-itively given. Finitary mathematics was not in need of any further justification or reduction. Hilbert’s program proceeded gradually by studying weak theories at first and proceeding to progressively stronger ones. The metatheory of a formal system studies properties such as consistency, completeness, and some others (“completeness” in the logical sense means that all true orin the calculus are formally deducible in it).
Pro posi-valid formulas that can be represented tional logic was quickly proved to be consistent and complete. First-order logic, also known as predicate logic of 1929. For all of the 1920 s, the attention of Hilbert, was proved complete by Gödel in his dissertation and coworkers was set on elementary arithmetic and its subsystems; once this had been settled, the project was to move on to the much more difficult, but crucial, cases of the theory of real numbers and set theory.
Ackermann and von Neumann were able to establish consis-tency results for certain subsystems of arithmetic, but between 1928 and 1930 Hilbert was convinced that the consistency of arithmetic had already been established. Then came the severe blow of Gödel’s incompleteness results (see section 4). gram, came from the fact that Hilbert’ssisted in formalizing each mathematical theory, and The name “formalism,” as a description of this pro-method conformally studying its proof structure.
However, this name is rather one-sided and even confusing, especially because it is usually contrasted with intuition-ism, a full-blown philosophy of mathematics. Like most mathematicians, Hilbert never viewed mathematics asa mere game played with formulas. Indeed, he often emphasized the meaningfulness of (in formal) mathe-mat ical statements and the depth of conceptual content expressed in them.10

3.3 Personal Disputes

The crisis was unfolding not just at an intellectual level but also at a personal level. One should perhaps tell this story as a tragedy, in which the personalities ofthe main figures and the successive events made the final result quite inescapable. Hilbert and Brouwer were very different personalities, though they were both extremely willful and clever men. Brouwer’s worldview was idealistic and tended to solipsism. He had an artistic temperament and an edited by Rowe (1992), and also in the 1930 paper that bears exactly the same title (see10.
This is very explicit, for example, in the lectures of 1919–20 Gesammelte Abhandlungen, volume 3).

eccentric private life. He despised the modern world, looking to the inner life of the self as the only way out (at least in principle, though not always in practice). He preferred to work in isolation, although he had good friends in the mathematical community, especially in the international group of topologists that gathered around him. Hilbert was typically modernist in his views and attitudes; full of optimism and ratio-nalism, he was ready to lead his university, his country, and the international community into a new world.
He was very much in favor of collaboration, and felt happy to join Klein’s schemes for institutional development and power. As a consequence of World War I, Germans in the early 1920 s were not allowed to attend the Interna-tional Congresses of Mathematicians. When the opportunity finally arose in 1928, Hilbert was eager to seize on it, but Brouwer was furious because of restrictions that were still imposed on the German delegation and sent a circular letter in order to convince other math-ematicians. Their viewpoints were widely known and led to a clash between the two men.
On another level, Hilbert had made important concessions to his opponents in the 1920 s, hoping that he would succeed in his project of finding a consistency proof. brouwer emphasized these concessions, accusing him of failing to recognize authorship, and demanded new con-ces sions.11 Hilbert must have felt insulted and perhaps even threatened by a man whom he regardedas perhaps the greatest mathematician of the younger generation. had since 1915 been a member of the editorial board of The last straw came with an episode in 1928.
Brouwer Mathematische Annalen, the most prestigious mathematics journal at the time, of which Hilbert had been the main editor since 1902. Ill with “pernicious anemia,” and apparently thinking that he was close to theend, Hilbert feared for the future of his journal and decided it was imperative to remove Brouwer from the editorial board. When he wrote to other members of the board explaining his scheme, which he was already car-rying out, Einstein replied saying that his proposal was unwise and that he wanted to have nothing to do withit.
Other members, however, did not wish to upset the old and admired Hilbert. Finally, a dubious procedure was adopted, where the whole board was dissolved and created anew. Brouwer was greatly disturbed by this Mancosu 1998).11. See his “Intuitionistic reflections on formalism” of 1928 (in

action, and as a result of it the journal lost Einstein and Carathéodory, who had previously been main editors (see van Dalen 2005).After that, Brouwer ceased to publish for some years, leaving some book plans unfinished. With his disap-pearance from the scene, and with the gradual disappearance of previous political turbulences, the feelingsof “crisis” began to fade away (see Hesseling 2003). Hilbert did not intervene much in the subsequent debates and foundational developments.
4 Gödel and the Aftermath It was not only the mathematical community as a whole continued to work Annalen war that Hilbert won: the in the style of modern mathematics. And yet his program suffered a profound blow with the publication of Gödel’s famous 1931 article in the Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik op ment of meta mathematical methods—the arithme-. An extremely ingenious develtization of metamathematics—allowed Gödel to prove that systems like axiomatic set theory or Dedekind Peano arithmetic are incomplete (see[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem)).
That is, there exist propositionsgödel’s theorem P formulated strictly in the language of the system such that neither P nor ¬P is formally provable in the system. Hilbert’s endeavor, as it shows that formal proof cannot This theorem already presented a deep problem for even capture arithmetical truth.
But there was more. A close look at Gödel’s arguments made it clear that this first meta mathematical proof could itself be for-malized, which led to “Gödel’s second theorem”—that it is impossible to establish the consistency of the systems mentioned above by any proof that can be codified within them. Gödel’s arithmetization of metamathematics makes it possible to build a sentence, inthe language of formal arithmetic, that expresses the consistency of this same formal system.
And this sen-tence turns out to be among those that are unprovable.12 To express it con tr a positively, a finitary formal proof (codifiable in the system of formal arithmetic)of the impossibility of proving 1= 0 could be trans-formed into a contradiction of the system! Thus, ifthe system is indeed consistent (as most mathematicians are convinced it is), then there is no such fini-tary proof. jen oort (1967), and good introductions to mathematical logic. both theorems were carefully proved in Hilbert and Bernays (1934/39).

One should emphasize that Gödel’s negative results are purely constructivist ic and even finitistic, valid for all parties in the foundational debate.

Although the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms suffice for giving a rig-orous foundation to most of today’s mathematics, and have a rather convincing intuitive justification in terms of the “iterative” conception of sets,13 there is a general feeling that foundational studies, instead of achieving their ambitious goal, “found themselves attracted into the whirl of mathematical activity, and are now enjoying full voting rights in the mathematical senate.”14 Proof theory has developed, leading to noteworthy reductions of classical theories to systems that can be However, this impression is some what

A striking example is that analysis can be formalized in conservative extensions of arithmetic: that is, in systems that extend the lan-guage of arithmetic while including all theorems of arithmetic, but which are “conservative” in the sense that they have no new consequences in the language of arithmetic. Some parts of analysis can even be devel-oped in conservative extensions of primitive recursive arithmetic (see Feferman 1998).
This raises questions about the philosophical bases on which the admissibil-ity of the relevant constructive theories can be founded. But for these systems the question is far less simple than it was for Hilbert’s finitary mathematics; it seems of iterating the following operation: one starts with a basic domain V013. The basic idea is to view the set-theoretic universe as a product(possibly finite or even equal to∅) and forms all possible sets of elements in the domain; this gives a new domain forming sets of$V^{0} ∪V^{1}$, and so on (to infinity and beyond!).
This pro-V1, and one iterates duces an open-ended set-theoretic universe, masterfully described by Zermelo (1930). On the iterative conception, see, for example, the last papers in Bernacerraf and Putnam (1983).14. To use the words of Gian-Carlo Rota in an essay of 1973.

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics fair to say that no general consensus has yet been reached. Whatever its roots and justification may be, mathematics is a human activity. This truism is clear from the subsequent development of our story. The mathematical community refused to abandon “classical” ideas and methods; the constructivist “revolution” was aborted. In spite of its failure, formalism established itself in practice as the avowed ideology of twentieth-century mathematicians.
Some have remarked that formalism was less a real faith than a Sunday refuge for those who spent their weekdays working on mathematical objects as something very real. The Platonism of working days was only abandoned, as asaid, when a ready-made reply was needed to unwel-bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) member come philosophical questions concerning mathemat i-cal knowledge. One should note that formalism suited very well the needs of a self-conscious, autonomous community ofresearch mathematicians.
It granted them full freedom to choose their topics and to employ modern meth-ods to explore them. However, to reflective mathematical minds it has long been clear that it is not the answer. Epistemological questions about mathematical knowledge have not been “eliminated from the world”; philosophers, historians, cognitive scientists, and oth-ers keep looking for more adequate ways of understanding its content and development.
Need less to say, this does not threaten the autonomy of mathematical researchers—if autonomy is to be a concern, perhaps we should worry instead about the pressures exerted on us by the market and other powers. Both (semi-)constructivism and modern mathematics have continued to develop:
the contrast between them has simply been consolidated, though in a very unbalanced way, since some 99% of practicing mathe-maticians are “modern.” (But do statistics matter when it comes to the correct methods for mathematics?) In 1905, commenting on the French debate,[VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) wrote that “there are two conceptions of math-hadamard ematics, two mentalities, in evidence.” It has now cometo be recognized that there is value in both approaches: they complement each other and can coexist peacefully.
In particular, interest in effective methods, algorithms, and computational mathematics has grown markedly in recent decades—and all of these are closer to the constructivist tradition. The foundational debate left a rich legacy of ideas and results, key insights and developments, including the formulation of axiomatic set theories and the rise

155

of intuitionism. One of the most important of these developments was the emergence of modern mathematical logic as a refinement of axiomatics, which led tothe theories of recursion and computability in around 1936 (see understanding of the characteristics, possibilities, and algorithms [II.4 §3.2](/part-02/algorithms)). In the process, our limitations of formal systems was hugely clarified. One of the hottest issues through out the whole debate, and probably its main source, was the question of how to understand the continuum.
The reader may recall the contrast between the set-theoretic understanding of the real numbers and Brouwer’s approach, which rejected the idea that the continuum is “built of” points. That this is a labyrinthine question was further established by results on Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH), which postulates that the cardinality of the set of real numbers isnite cardinal, or equivalently that every infinite subset$\aleph^{1}$, the second transfiof R must biject with either N or with R itself.
Gödel proved in 1939 that CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory, but Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that it is independent of its axioms (i.e., Cohen proved that the negation of CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory)). The problem is still alive, with a few mathematicians proposing alternative approaches to the continuum and others trying to find new and con-vincing set-theoretic principles that will settle Cantor’s question (see Woodin 2001).
a definitive way to clarifying the peculiar style and methodology of modern mathematics, especially the The foundational debate has also contributed in so-called Platonism or existential character of modern mathematics (see the classic 1935 paper of Bernays in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983)), by which is meant(here at least) a methodological trait rather than any supposed implications of metaphysical existence. Mod-ern mathematics investigates structures by considering their elements as given independently of human (or mechanical) capabilities of effective definition and construction.
This may seem surprising, but perhaps this trait can be explained by broader characteristics of scientific thought and the role played by mathematical structures in the modeling of scientific phenomena. and its modern methods are still surrounded by impor-tant philosophical problems. When a sizable amount of In the end, the debate made it clear that mathematics mathematical knowledge can be taken for granted, the-orems can be established and problems can be solved with the certainty and clarity for which mathematics is celebrated.
But when it comes to laying out the bare 156 beginnings, philosophical issues cannot be avoided. The reader of these pages may have felt this at several places, especially in the discussion of intuitionism, but also in the basic ideas behind Hilbert’s program, andof course in the problem of the relationship between formal mathematics and its in formal counterpart, a problem that is brought into sharp focus by Gödel’s theorems.

Here is an elegant proof that the answer is yes. Let$x = \sqrt{2} \sqrt{}^{2}$.
If x is rational then we have our example.$But$ x. qrt2 = . qrt{2}2 = 2 is rational, so if x is irrational then again we have an example. Now this argument certainly establishes that it is possible fora and b to be irrational and for ab to be rational. However, the proof has a very interesting feature: it is nonconstructive, in the sense that it does not actually name two irrationals Instead, it tells us that either we can takea and bathat work.= b = . qrt{2} or we can take not tell us which of these alternatives will work, it gives$a = \sqrt{2} \sqrt{}^{2} and b = \sqrt{2}$.
Not only does it us absolutely no clue about how to find out. Arguments of this kind have troubled some philosophers and philosophically inclined mathematicians, butas far as mainstream mathematics goes they are a fully accepted and important style of reasoning. Formally, we have appealed to the “law of the excluded middle.” We have shown that the negation of the statement cannot be true, and deduced that the statement itself must be true.
A typical reaction to the proof above isnot that it is in any sense in valid, but merely that its nonconstructive nature is rather surprising. Nevertheless, faced with a nonconstructive proof, it is very natural to ask whether there is a constructive proof. After all, an actual construction may give usmore insight into the statement, which is an important point since we prove things not only to be sure they are true but also to gain an idea of why they are true.
Of course, to ask whether there is a constructive proof is not to suggest that the nonconstructive proof is in valid, but just that it may be more informative tohave a constructive proof.

use for building sets out of other sets. Typical exam-ples of such rules are the statement that for any set The axiom of choice is one of several rules that we A we can form the set of all its subsets, and the statement that for any set A and any property p we can form the set of all elements of A that satisfy p (these are usually called thehension, respectively). Roughly speaking, the axiom of power-set axiom and the axiom of com pre choice says that we are allowed to make an arbitrary number of unspecified choices when we wish to form a set.
so natural that one may not even notice that one is using it, and indeed it was applied by many math-Like the other axioms, the axiom of choice can seem ematicians before it was first formalized. To get anidea of what it means, let us look at the well-known proof that the union of a countable family of countable setsily is countable allows us to write out the sets in a[III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets) is countable. The fact that the famlistual set A1, AA2, Ais countable allows us to write its elements3, . . .

We then finish the proof by elements Now in that proof we actually made an infinite num-anm. ber of unspecified choices. We were told that each A was countable and then for each$An$we “chose” a list-$n$ ing of the elements ofwe had made. More over, since we are told absolutely An with out specifying the choice nothing about the sets say how we choose to list them.
This remark does not$An$, it is clearly impossible to invalidate the proof, but it does show that it is nonconstructive. (Note, however, that if we are actually told what the sets An are, then we may well be able to spec- ify listings of their elements and there by give a con-struc tive proof that the union of those particular sets is countable.)Here is another example. A graph [III.34] is bipartite Y in such a way that no two vertices in the same class if its vertices can be split into two classes X and

are connected by an edge. For example, any even cycle(an even number of points arranged in a circle, with consecutive points joined) is bipartite, while no odd cycle is. Now, is an infinite disjoint union of even cycles bipartite? Of course it is: we just split each of the individual cycles let X be the union of the sets C into two classes X Xand C and Y be the union YC and then of the sets YC. But how do we choose for each cycle CCwe cannot actually specify how we do this, so we are which set to call XC and which to call YC?
Again, using the axiom of choice (even if we do not explicitly say so). In general, the axiom of choice states that if we are given a family of nonempty setsan element xi from each one. More precisely, it states Xi, then we may select that if the X are nonempty sets, where i ranges overi

(More formally, we might say that the function f1 that takes 11 toof the single set$x1$is a choice function for the “family” that consists$X1$.) For two sets, and indeed for any finite collection of sets, one can prove the existence ofa choice function by induction on the number of sets.
But for infinitely many sets it turns out that one cannot deduce the existence of a choice function from the other rules for building sets. choice? The main reason is that if it is used in a proof, then that part of the proof is automatically noncon-Why do people make a fuss about the axiom of struc tive. This is reflected in the very statement of the axiom.
For the other rules that we use, such as “one may take the union of two sets,” the set whose exis-tence is being asserted is uniquely defined by its properties (u is an element of X ∪ Y if and only if it is an element ofwith the axiom of choice: the object whose existence is X or of Y or of both). But this is not the case asserted (a choice function) is not uniquely specified byits properties, and there will typically be many choice functions.

III. Mathematical Concepts

[V.3](/part-05/the-banachtarski-paradox). This says that there is a way of dividing upa solid unit sphere into a finite number of subsets and then reassembling these subsets (using rotations, reflections, and translations) to form two solid unit spheres. The proof does not provide an explicit way of defining the subsets. It is some times claimed that the axiom of choice has “undesirable” or “highly counter intuitive” consequences, but in almost all cases a little thought reveals that the consequence under consider at i on is actually not counter intuitive at all.
For example, consider the Banach–Tarski paradox above. Why does it seem strange and paradoxical? It is because we feel that volume has not been preserved. And indeed, this feeling can be converted into a rigorous argument that the subsets used in the decomposition cannot all be sets to which one can meaningfully assign a volume. But that is not a paradox at all:
we can say what we mean by the volume of a nice set such as a polyhedron, but there isno reason to suppose that we can give a sensible definition of volume forject called measure theory can be used to give a volume all subsets of the sphere.
(The subto a very wide class of sets, called the measurable sets [III.55](/part-03/measures), but there is no reason at all to believe that all sets should be measurable, and indeed it can be shown, again by a use of the axiom of choice, that there are sets that are not measurable.) There are two forms of the axiom of choice that are more often used in daily
mathematical life than the basic form we have been discussing. One is the well-ordering principlebe well-ordered [III.66](/part-03/ordinals). The other is, which states that every set can Zorn’s lemma, which states that under certain circumstances “maximal” elements exist. For example, a basis for a vector space is precisely a maximal linearly independent set, and it turns out that Zorn’s lemma applies to the col-lection of linearly independent sets in a vector space, which shows that every vector space has a basis.
of choice because they are equivalent to it, in the sense that each one both implies the axiom of choice and may These two statements are called forms of the axiom be deduced from it, in the presence of the other rules for building sets. A good way of seeing why these two other forms of the axiom have a nonconstructive feelto them is to spend a few minutes trying to find a wellordering of the reals, or a basis for the vector space ofall sequences of real numbers.
For more about the axiom of choice, and especially about its relationship to the other axioms of formal set theory, see set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory).

III.3. Bayesian Analysis

III.2 The Axiom of Determinacy

Consider the following “infinite game.” Two players, A and B, take turns to name natural numbers, with Agoing first, say. By doing this, they generate an infinite sequence. A wins the game if this sequence is “eventu-ally periodic,” and B wins if it is not. (An eventually periodic sequence is one like 1,56, 4, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8,3,5, 8 to a recurring pattern.) It is not hard to see that B, 3, . . .: that is, one that settles down after a while has a winning strategy for this game, since eventu-ally periodic sequences are rather special.
However, at any stage of the game it is always possible that Awill win (if B plays sufficiently badly), since every finite sequence is the beginning of many eventually periodic sequences. More generally, any collection Sof infinite sequences of natural numbers gives rise to an infinite game: A’sobject is now to ensure that the sequence produced is one of the sequences inthe reverse. The resulting game is called$S$, and B’s object is to ensure determined if one of the two players has a winning strategy.
As wehave seen, the game is certainly determined when S is the set of eventually periodic sequences, and indeed for just about any setsee that the corresponding game is determined. Never-S that one writes down it is easy to the less, it turns out that there are games that are not determined.
(It is an instructive exercise to see where the plausible-seeming argument, “If A does not have a winning strategy, then A cannot force a win, so B must have a winning strategy,” breaks down.) but the constructions use It is not too hard to construct nondetermined games, the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice):
roughly speaking, one can well-order all possible strate-gies so that each one has fewer predecessors than there are infinite sequences, and select sequences to belongto S or its complement in a way that stops each strat- egy in turn from being a winning strategy for either player. determined. It contradicts the axiom of choice, but itis a rather interesting axiom when it is added to The axiom of determinacy states that all games arethe zermelo–fraenkel axioms turns out, for example, to imply that many sets of[III.99](/part-03/the-zermelofraenkel-axioms) with out choice.

Suppose you throw a pair of standard dice. The proba-bility that the total is 10 is 1 because there are thirtysix ways the dice can come up, of which three (4 and6, 5 and 5, and 6 and 4) give 10. If, however, you look12 at the first die and see that it came up as a 6, then the conditional probability that the total is 10, given this information, is other die comes up as a 4).16 (since that is the probability that the In general, the probability of A given Bis defined to be the probability ofof B.

Dividing through by P[A ∧ B] and the right-hand P[B] we obtain Bayes’s theorem: P[A|B] = P[B|PA][B]P[A], which expresses the conditional probability of B in terms of the conditional probability of B given A given A. dom data given by an unknown tion A fundamental problem in statistics is to analyze ran-[III.71](/part - 03/probability - distributions). Here, Bayes’s theorem can make a signif-probability distri bui cant contribution.
 For example, suppose you are told that some unbiased coins have been tossed and that three of them have come up heads. Suppose that youare told that the number of coins tossed is between 1 and 10, and that you wish to guess this number. Let stand for the event that three coins came up heads and$H3$ letand 10 it is not hard to calculate the conditional prob-C be the number of coins. Then for each n between 1 ability reverse, namely P[H3|C =P[Cn]=, but we would like to know then|H ]. Bayes’s theorem tells us that it is P$[H^{3}|C = n] P[CP[H = {}^{3}n]]$.
This would tell us the ratios between the various con-dition al probabilities P[C = n|H ] if we knew what the$160 probabilities P$[C = n] were. Typically, one does not know this, but one makes some kind of guess, called aprior distribution. For example, one might guess, before knowing that three coins had come up heads, that for each coins had been chosen wasn between 1 and 10 the probability that1. After this information, n one would use the calculation above to revise one’sassessment and obtain a posterior distribution10 , in which the probability that1 P[H |C = n].
C = n would be proportional to 10 There is more to Bayesian analysis than simply apply-3 ing Bayes’s theorem to replace prior distributions byposterior distributions. In particular, as in the example just given, there is not always an obvious prior distribution to take, and it is a subtle and interesting mathematical problem to devise methods for choosing prior distributions that are “optimal” in different ways.

In his celebrated 1925 paper “The orie der Zöpfe,” artin [VI.86](/part-06/emil-artin-18981962) showed that multiplication in Bn is completely described by the relationsσiσj = σjσi (|i - j| ⩾ 2)$,σiσi + 1σi = σi + 1σiσi + 1$.

These relations have subsequently acquired impor-tance in statistical physics, where they are known as the Yang–Baxter equations. In groups defined by generators and relations it is usually difficult (there being no method that works uniformly in all cases) to decide whether an arbitrary word in the generators represents the identity element(see geometric and combinatorial group theory [IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory)).

Although such similarities suggested that it should be possible to prove that braid groups genuinely are linear, the problem of doing so remained unsolved for many years, until in 2001 a proof was eventually found by Bigelow and independently by Krammer.

The invertible linear transformations on a vector space form a group, called the general linear group. Ifn is the dimension of the vector space and Kis the field of scalars, then it is denoted by GLa basis for the vector space, then each group ele me ntn(K), and if we pick can be written as ann . imes n matrix whose determinant [III.15](/part - 03/determinants) is nonzero. This group and its subgroups are of great interest in mathematics, and can be studied “geometrically” in the following way.
Instead of looking at the vector space unique role and is fixed by the group, we use the V, where of course the origin plays apro- jective space of projective space are the one-dimensional subspaces[I.3 §6.7](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) associated with V: the points of planes are the three-dimensional subspaces, and so on.

For example, Sl several important subgroups of GLn(K) consists of all linearn(K) can be ob- transformations of determinant 1.

These subgroups are called classical groups. The classical groups are either simple or close to simple (for example, we can often make them simple by quotienting out by the subgroup of scalar matrices).
When complex numbers, the classical groups are Kis the field of real or Lie groups. lie theory classical groups, which fall into one of four families, Lie groups and their classification are discussed in[III.48](/part - 03/lie - theory): the simple Lie groups comprise the known as number), along with other types known as$A^{n}$, Bn, Cn, and Dn (where n is a natural E6$, E7$, E8, 162 Fsions of the groups.

For that would embrace all families, and ended up creating the theory of The full abstract definition of a building is some what buildings. complicated, so instead we shall try to give some idea ofthe concept by looking at the building associated with the groups GLn(K) and SLn(K), which are of type (An)-1.
This building is ancan be thought of as a higher-dimensional analogue of a abstract simplicial complex, which graph vertices[III.34]. It consists of a collection of points called; as in a graph, some pairs of vertices form edges; however, it is then possible for triples of vertices to form two-dimensional vertices to form(k - 1)-dimensional “simplexes.” (The faces, and for sets of$k$ geometrical meaning of the word “simplex” is a con-vex hull of a finite set of points in general position:
for instance, a three-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron.) All faces of simplexes must also be included, so for example three vertices cannot form a two-dimensional face unless each pair is joined by an edge. To form the building of type$A^{-}$, we start by taking all the 1-spaces, 2-spaces, 3-spaces, and so on (corre-$n^{1}$ sponding to points, lines, planes, and so on, in projec-tive space), and treat them as “vertices.” The simplexes are formed by all nested sequences of proper sub - spaces:
for example, a 2-space inside a 4-space inside a 5-space will form a “triangle” whose vertices are these three subspaces. The simplexes of maximal dimen-sion haven - 1 vertices: a 1-space inside a 2-space inside a 3 - space, and so on. These simplexes are called chambers. There are many subspaces, so a building is a huge object. However, buildings have important sub ge ome-tries called apartments, which in the(An)-1 case are III. Mathematical Concepts obtained by taking a basis for the vector space, and then taking all subspaces generated by subsets of this basis.
For example, in the A3 case our vector space is four dimensional, so a basis has four elements; its subsets span four 1 - spaces, six 2 - spaces, and four 3 - spaces. To visualize this apartment it helps to view the four 1-spaces as the vertices of a tetrahedron, the six 2-spaces as the midpoints of its edges, and the four 3-spaces as the midpoints of its faces. The apartment has twenty-four chambers, six for each face of the original tetrahedron, and they form a triangular tiling ofthe surface of the tetrahedron.
This surface is topologically equivalent to a sphere, as are all apartments of this building: such buildings are called buildings for the groups of Lie type are all spherical, spherical. The and, just as ments are related to the regular and semiregular poly - A3 is related to the tetrahedron, their apart- hedra inn dimensions, where n is the subscript in the Lie notation given earlier. Buildings have the following two noteworthy features. First, any two chambers lie in a common apart - ment: this is not obvious in the example above but it can be proved using linear algebra.
Second, in any building all apartments are isomorphic and any two apartments intersect nicely: more precisely, if A and A^ are apart- ments, then phism from AAto∩AAthat fixes is convex and there is an isomor- A∩A. These two features were originally used by Tits in defining buildings. a pleasing geometric basis for the groups of Lie type: itcan also be used to construct the ones of types The theory of spherical buildings does not just give E , E , Es op his ti cated machinery such as Lie algebras.
Once the8$, and F4$, for an arbitrary field K, with out the need fo(r6)7 building has been constructed (and a construction canbe given in a surprisingly simple manner), a theorem of Tits on the existence of automorphisms shows that the groups themselves must exist. In a spherical building the apartments are tilings of a sphere, but other types of buildings also play signifi-cant roles. Of particular importance are affine buildings, in which the apartments are tilings of Euclidean space;
such buildings arise in a natural way from groups, such as GLn(K), where K is a p-adic field [III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory). For such fields there are two buildings, one spherical and one affine, but the affine one carries more information and yields the spherical building as a structure “at infin-ity.” Going beyond affine buildings, there are hyperbolic buildings, whose apartments are tilings of hyperbolic space; they arise naturally in the study of hyperbolic Kac–Moody groups.

III.6. Calabi–Yau Manifolds

III.6 Calabi–Yau Manifolds

Eric Zaslow

1 Basic Definition

Calabi–Yau manifolds, named after Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau, arise in Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry, and play a prominent role in string theory and mirror symmetry. to recall the notion of orientability on a real fold In order to explain what they are, we need first[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Such a manifold is orientable if youmanican choose coordinate systems at each point in sucha way that any two system sx = (x1, . . . , xm) andygive rise to a positive Jacobi an: det= (y1, . . . , ym)that are defined on overlapping sets(. artial yi/. artial xj) > 0.
The notion of a Calabi–Yau manifold is the natural complex analogue of this. Now the manifold is complex, and for each local coordinate system z = (z1, . . . , zn) one has avital that holomorphic functionf should be nonvanishing[I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions): that is, it neverf (z). It is takes the value 0. There is also a compatibility condi-tion: i. ar{f}z(z) is another coordinate system, then the cor- responding function  ̃$f = f$ ̃$\det (\partial z$ ̃$a/\partial z^{b})$.
Note that if we replace all complexf is related to f by the equation terms by real terms in this definition, then we have thenotion of a real orientation. So a Calabi–Yau manifold can be thought of informally as a complex manifold with complex orientation. 2 Complex Manifolds and Hermitian Structure Before we go any further, a few words about complex and Kähler geometry are in order. A complex manifoldis a structure that looks locally like Cn, in the sense that one can find complex coordinates$z = (z^{1}$, . . . , zn) near every point.
More over, where two coordinate sys-tems$z$and  ̃zoverlap, the coordinates  ̃$z^{a} \text{are holomor}-$ phic when they are regarded as functions of the$z^{b}$. Thus, the notion of a holomorphic function on a com-plex manifold makes sense and does not depend on the coordinates used to express the function.
In this way, the local geometry of a complex manifold does indeed look like an open set in point looks like Cn itself. Cn, and the tangent space at a Hermitian On complex vector spaces it is natural to consider inner products [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) represented by hermitian matrices$ea$. On complex manifolds, a Hermitian inner product[III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties)(ga)b^ ̄ with respect to a basis on the tangent spaces is called a “Hermitian metric,”

and is represented in a coordinate basis by a hermitian matri xg , which depends on position.1 ab^ ̄

When your path is a closed loop, the vector at the starting point comes back to a new vector at the same point.(A good example to think about is a path on a sphere that goes from the North Pole to the equator, then a quarter of the way around the equator, then back to the North Pole again.
When the journey is completed, the “constant” vector that began by pointing south will have been rotated by 90◦.) With each loop we asso- ciate a matrix operator called the which sends the starting vector to the ending vector; holonomy matrix, the group generated by all of these matrices is called the holonomy group of the manifold. Since the length of the vector does not change during the process of keeping it constant along the loop, the holonomy matrices all lie in the orthogonal group of length-preserving matrices, O(m).
If the manifold is oriented, then the holonomy group must lie in SO(m), as one can see by transporting an oriented basis of vectors around the loop. is also a real manifold of (real) dimension which one can think of as coordinatized by the real Every complex manifold of (complex) dimension$m = 2nn$, and imaginary parts of the complex coordinates$z^{j}$. Real manifolds that arise in this way have additional structure.
For example, the fact that we can multiply complex coordinate directions by ithat there must be an operator on the real tangent$= \sqrt{-1} implies$ space that squares to±i, which can be thought of as “holomorphic” and-1. This operator has eigenvalues “anti-holomorphic” directions. The Hermitian property states that these directions are orthogonal, and we say that the manifold istransport around loops. This means that the holon-Kähler if they remain so after omy group is a subgroup of Usubgroup of SO(m): complex manifolds always have(n) (which itself is a realof the Kähler property:

definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold given above—a Given a complex orientation—that is, the nonmetric compatible Kähler structure lies in SU(n) ⊂ U(n), the natural analogue of the case leads to a holonomy that of real orientation. This is the metric definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold. 4 The Calabi Conjecture Calabi conjectured that, for any Kähler manifold of complex dimension there exists a functionn and any complex orientation, uand a new Kähler metric  ̃g, given in coordinates by g̃ a^ ̄b = ga^ ̄b + . artial z. artia(la)2. artial u. ar{z}b , that is compatible with the orientation.

Thus, the metric notion of a Calabi–Yauf is the holomorphic orientation function dis- manifold amounts to a formidable nonlinear partial dif-ferential equation foru. Calabi proved the uniqueness and Yau proved the existence of a solution to this equation. So in fact the metric definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold is uniquely determined by its Kähler structure and its complex orientation.
Yau’s theorem establishes that the space of metrics with holonomy group SUplex orientation is in correspondence with the space(n) on a manifold with com- of in equivalent Kähler structures. The latter space can easily be probed with the techniques of algebraic geometry. 5 Calabi–Yau Manifolds in Physics Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, con-struc ts equations that the metric of a Riemannian space-time manifold must obey (see general relativity equations involve three symmetric tensors:

This means thatwe must solve quantum gravity in two dimensions— a problem that, like its four-dimensional cousin, is too hard. If, however, it happens that the two-dimensional worldsheet theory is conformal (invariant under local changes of scale), then just a finite-dimensional space of conformally in equivalent metrics remains, and the theory is well - defined. The Calabi–Yau condition arises from these considerations.
The requirement that the two-dimensional theory should be conformal, so that the string theory makes good sense, is in essence the requirement that the Ricci tensor of space-time should vanish. Thus, atwo-dimensional condition leads to a space-time equation, which turns out to be exactly Einstein’s equation with out matter. We add to this condition the “phe-no meno logical” criterion that the theory be endowed with “supersymmetry,” which requires the space-time manifold M to be complex.
The two conditions together mean that M is a complex manifold with holonomy group Su theorem, the choices of such(n): that is, a Calabi–Yau manifold. By Yau’s M can easily be described by algebraic geometric methods. We remark that there is a kind of distillation of string theory called “topological strings,” which can be given a rigorous mathematical framework. Calabi–Yau mani-folds are both symplectic and complex, and this leads to two versions of topological strings, called A and B, that one can associate with a Calabi–Yau manifold.
Mirror symmetry is the remarkable phenomenon that the A version of one Calabi–Yau manifold is related to the B version of an entirely different “mirror partner.” The III.8. Categories mathematical consequences of such an equivalence are extremely rich. (See mirror symmetry [IV.16](/part - 04/mirror - symmetry) for more details.

Eugenia Cheng

When we study[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), we pay particular attention to certain classes groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or vector spaces of maps between them: the important maps between groups are the group homomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), and the important maps between vector spaces are theear maps [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). What makes these maps important linis that they are the functions that “preserve structure”:
for example, ifφ is a homomorphism from a group G to a group sense that Hφ(g, then it “preserves multiplication,” in theg ) = φ(g )φ(g ) for any pair of ele - mentsg1 and (g1()2)2 of G. Similarly, linear maps preserv(e1)2 addition and scalar multiplication. The notion of a structure-preserving map applies far more generally than just to these two examples, andone of the purposes of category theory is to understand the general properties of such maps.
For instance, if B, and C are mathematical structures of some given A, 165 type, and A to B and fromf and Bgtoare structure-preserving maps from C, respectively, then their compos- ite g◦f is a structure-preserving map from A to C. That is, structure-preserving maps can beif the range of one equals the domain of the other). Wecomposed (at least also use structure-preserving maps to decide when to regard two structures as “essentially the same”:
we call A and B isomorphic if there is a structure-preserving map from structure. A to B with an inverse that also preserves one to discuss properties such as these in the abstract. A category is a mathematical structure that allows It consists of a collection ofphisms between those objects. That is, if objects, together witha and bmor-are two objects in the category, then there is a collection of morphisms between composition of morphisms: ifa and b.
There is also a notion off is a morphism from a to com posi teb and gofis a morphism fromf and g, which is a morphism fromb to c, then there is aa to c. This composition must be associative. In addition, for each object$a$ there is an “identity morphism,” which has the property that if you compose it with another morphismf then you get f . a category is the category of groups. The objects of As the earlier discussion suggests, an example of this category are groups, the morphisms are group homomorphisms, and composition and the identity are defined in the way we are used to.
However, it is by no means the case that all categories are like this, as the following examples show. (i) We can form a category by taking the natural num-bers as its objects, and letting the morphisms from n to m be all the n . imes  m matrices with real entries. Composition of morphisms is the usual matrix multiplication. We would not normally think of ann . imes  m matrix as a map from the number n to the number nevertheless satisfied.m, but the axioms for a category are (ii) Any set can be turned into a category:
the objects are the elements of the set, and a morphism from x to yis the assertion “ x = y.” We can also make an ordered set into a category by letting a mor-phism fromx to ybe the assertion “x ⩽ y.” (The “composite” of “x ⩽ y” and “y ⩽ z” is “x ⩽ z.”) (iii) Any grouplows: you have just one object, and the morphisms G can be made into a category as fol- from that object to itself are the elements of the group, with the group multiplication defining the composition of two morphisms.

166

(iv) There is an obvious category where the objects are topological spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) and the morphisms are continuous functions. A less obvious category with the same objects takes as its morphisms not continuous functions but homotopy classes [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of continuous functions. Morphisms are also called maps. However, as the above examples illustrate, the maps in a category donot have to be remotely map-like.
They are also called arrows, partly to emphasize the more abstract nature of a general category, and partly because arrows are often used to represent morphisms pictorially. morphisms” enable us to seek and study structural fea-The general framework and language of “objects and tures that depend only on the “shape” of the category, that is, on its morphisms and the equations they satisfy.
The idea is both to make general arguments that are then applicable to all categories possessing partic-ular structural features, and also to be able to make arguments in specific environments with out having to go into the details of the structures in question. The useof the former to achieve the latter is some times referred to, endearingly or otherwise, as “abstract nonsense.” As we mentioned above, the morphisms in a category are generally depicted as arrows, so a morphism

This notation greatly eases complex calculations and gives rise to the so-called are often associated with category theory; an equality commutative diagrams that between composites of morphisms such as$g \circf = t \circs$ is expressed by asserting that the following diagram commutes, that is, that either of the two different paths froma to cyields the same composite:

Proving that one long string of compositions equals another then becomes a matter of “filling in” the space in between with smaller diagrams that are already known to commute. Further more, many important mathematical concepts can be described in terms of commutative diagrams: some examples are free groups, free rings, free algebras, quotients, products, disjoint unions, function spaces, direct and inverse limits, completion, compact if ic at i on, and geometric realization.

It expresses the fact that givis precisely the same as giving a function from eachof the individual sets; this completely characterizes a disjoint union (which we regard as defined up to isomorphism).
Another viewpoint is that the universal property expresses the fact that a disjoint union is the “most free” way of having two sets map into another set, neither adding any information nor col-lapsing any information. Universal properties are central to the way category theory describes structures that are some how “canonical.” (See also the discus-sion of free groups in geometric and combinatorial group theory Another key concept in a category is that of an[IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory).) isomorphism morphism with a two-sided inverse.

it is one of the basic theorems of algebraic topology that a continuous map between two topological spaces (that takes marked point to marked point) gives rise to a homomorphism between their fundamental groups. Further more, there is a notion of morphism between functors called aogous to the notion of homotopy between maps of natural transformation, which is anal topological spaces. Given continuous maps F, G: X \to YX, a homotopy from, a path in Y from Fx F toto Ggx gives us, for every point; analogously, given func-x in tors F, G:

There is also a commuting condition that isx in X, a morphism in Y from analogous to the fact that, in the case of homotopy, apath in X must have its image under F continuously transformed to its image under any “holes” in the space Y.

there is a functor from the One example of a natural transformation encodes canonically is om or category of vector spaces to itself that takes each vec-tor space to its double dual, and there is an invertible natural transformation from this functor to the iden-tity functor via the canonical isomorphisms. By contrast, every finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to its dual, but not canonically so because the isomorphism involves an arbitrary choice of basis; if we attempt to construct a natural transformation inthis case, we find that the naturality condition fails.
In the presence of natural transformations, categories actually form a 2 generalization of a category, with objects, morphisms,-category, which is a two-dimensional and morphisms between morphisms. These last are thought of as two-dimensional morphisms; more generally ann-category has morphisms for each dimension up to Categories and the language of categories are usedn. in a wide variety of other branches of mathematics. Historically, the subject is closely associated with algebraic topology; the notions were first introduced in 1945 by Eilenberg and Mac Lane.
Applications followedin algebraic geometry, theoretical computer science, theoretical physics, and logic. Category theory, with its abstract nature and lack of dependency on other fields of mathematics, can be thought of as “foundational.” In fact, it has been proposed as an alternative candidate for the foundations of mathematics, with the notion of

All continuous functions are bounded. If$f$:$X \to R is$ a real-valued continuous function on X, then f must be bounded. (This is again a type of local-to-global principle: if a function does not vary too much locally, then it does not vary too much globally.) All continuous functions attain a maximum.

To these assertions we can add a fourth (which, like the others, has a rather trivial analogue for finite sets). All open covers have finite subcovers.

All four of these topological statements are false for sets such as the open unit interval line R, as one can easily check by constructing simple(0, 1) or the real counterexamples.

For instance, if you know that all sequencesin The above four assertions are closely related to each X contain convergent subsequences, then you can quickly deduce that all continuous functions have a maximum. This is done by first constructing a maximizing sequencef (x ) approaches the maximal value of—a sequence of pointsxnfin(or, more pre-X such that cisely, its supremum)—and then investigating a conver-$n$ gent subsequence of that sequence.
In fact, given some fairly mild assumptions on the space X (e.g., that X is a metric space), one can deduce any of these four statements from any of the others. space four assertions holds for To oversimplify a little, we say that a topological X is compact if one (and hence all) of the above X. Because the four assertions are not quite equivalent in general, the formal defini-tion of compactness uses only the fourth version: that every open cover has a finite subcover.
There are other notions of compactness, such asness, for example, which is based on the third version, sequential compact but the distinctions between these notions are technical and we shall gloss over them here. is used in many ways in many different areas of math-ematics. One is via appeal to local-to-global principles: Compactness is a powerful property of spaces, and it one establishes local control on a function, or on some other quantity, and then uses compactness to boost the local control to global control.
Another is to locate maxima or minima of a function, which is particularly useful in the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). A third is to partially recover the notion of a limit when deal-ing with nonconvergent sequences, by accepting the need to pass to a subsequence of the original sequence. (However, different subsequences may converge to dif-ferent limits; compactness guarantees the existence of a limit point, but not its uniqueness.) Compactness ofone object also tends to beget compactness of other objects;
for instance, the image of a compact set under a continuous map is still compact, and the product of finitely many or even infinitely many compact sets continues to be compact. This last result is known as Tychonoff’s theorem. An obvious example is the real linepact, because it contains sequences such as 1 Of course, many spaces of interest are not compact.

However, one can often recover compactness by adding a few more points to the space:

line by adding one point at each end: we call the added points+$\infty\text{and} −$. nfty. The resulting object, known as the extended real line[−$\infty$, +$\infty$], can be given a topology in a natural way, which basically defines what it means to converge to$+$. nfty or to −$\infty$. The extended real line is compact: any sequence will have a subsequence that either converges toxn of extended real numbers+$\infty$, or converges to−. nfty, or converges to a finite number.
Thus, by using this compact if ic at i on of the real line, we can generalize the notion of a limit to one that no longer has to be a real number. While there are some drawbacks to dealing with extended reals instead of ordi-nary reals (for instance, one can always add two real numbers together, but the sum of$+$. nfty and −$\infty$ is unde- fined), the ability to take limits of what would otherwise be divergent sequences can be very useful, par-ticular ly in the theory of infinite series and improper integrals. many different compactificatio ns.
For instance, by the It turns out that a single noncompact space can have device of cally identify the real line with a circle that has a sin-stereographic projection, one can topologigle point removed. (For example, if one maps the real number$x \text{to the point} (x/(1 + x^{2})$, x^2/(1 + x^2)), then R maps to the circle of radius 12 and center(0,1 2), with the north pole missing point, we obtain the(0,1) removed.)

For instance, the extended real line One can use compactificatio ns to distinguish be-[−. nfty,+. nfty] distinguishes between divergence to+. nftyand divergence to −. nfty. In a similar spirit, by using compactificatio ns of the plane R2 such as the [I.3 §6.7](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions), one can distinguish a sequence that diverges along (or near) thex-axis from a sequence that diverges along (or near) the projective planeytions in which sequences that diverge in different ways - axis. Such compactificatio ns arise naturally in sit ua exhibit markedly different behavior.

For instance, one can view a straight Another use of compactificatio ns is to allow one to line in the plane as the limit of increasingly large circles by describing a suitable compact if ic at i on of the space of circles that includes lines. This perspective allows us to deduce certain theorems about lines from analo-gous theorems about circles, and conversely to deduce certain theorems about very large circles from theo-rems about lines.
In a rather different area of mathematics, the Dirac delta function is not, strictly speaking, a function, but it exists in certain (local) compactificatio ns of spaces of functions, such as spaces ofsures [III.55](/part - 03/measures) or distributions [III.18](/part - 03/distributions). Thus, one canmeaview the Dirac delta function as a limit of classical func-tions, and this can be very useful for manipulating it.

Classes

One of the basic challenges of theoretical computer sci-ence is to determine what computational resources are necessary in order to perform a given computational task. The most basic resource is time, or equivalently (given the hardware) the number of steps needed toimplement the most efficient algorithm that will carry out the task. Especially important is how this time scales up with the size of the input for the task: for instance, how much longer does it take to factorize an integer with 2 Another resource connected with the feasibility of an digits than an integer with ndig its?
computation isage space a computer will need in order to implement memory: one can ask how much storan algorithm, and how this can be minimized. Aplexity class is a set of computational problems that can com be performed with certain restrictions on the resources allowed. For instance, the complexity class P consists of all problems that can be performed in “polynomialtime”: that is, there is some positive integerk such that if the size of the problem issize was the number of digits of the integer to be fac-n (in the example above, the torized), then the computation can be carried out in at

170

mostnk steps. A problem belongs to P if and only if the time taken to solve it scales up by at most a constant factor when the size of the input scales up by a con-stant factor. A good example of such a problem is multiplication of two n-digit numbers: if you use ordinary long multiplication, then replacing the time taken by a factor of 4. n by 2 n increases ger Suppose that you are presented with a positive inte-x and told that it is a product of two primes p andqknows, but one thing is easy to see: if you are told. How difficult is it to determinep and q?

The complexity class NP consists of those compu-x is even eas- tational tasks for which a correct answer can beified in polynomial time, even if it cannot ne ces sar-verily be found in polynomial time. Remarkably, although this is a fundamental distinction, nobody knows howto prove that$P = NP$: this problem is widely considered to be the most important in theoretical computer science.

It turns out tobe the natural class associated with reasonable computational strategies for games such as chess. The com-plexity class NC is the set of all Boolean functions that can be computed by a “circuit of polynomial size and depth at most a polynomial in log$n$.” This last class is a model for the class of problems that can be solved very rapidly using parallel processing.
In general, complexity classes are often surprisingly good at character-izing large families of problems with interesting and intuitively recognizable features in common. another remarkable fact is that almost all complexity classes have “hardest problems” within them: that is, problems for which a solution can be converted into a solution forany other problem in the class. These problems are said to be complete for the class in question. These issues, as well as several other complexity classes, are discussed in[IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity).
A vast number of further classes can be found computational complexity at http://qwiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Complexity_Zoo along with a brief definition of each.

III.11 Countable and Uncountable Sets

Infinite sets arise all the time in mathematics: the natu-ral numbers, the squares, the primes, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and so on. It is often natural to try to compare the sizes of these sets: intuitively, one feels that the set of natural numbers is “smaller” than the set of integers (as it contains just the positive ones), and much larger than the set of squares (since a typical large integer is unlikely to be a square). But can wemake comparisons of size in a precise way? ition about finite sets.
Ifare two ways we might go about comparing their sizes. An obvious method of attack is to build on our intu-A and Bare finite sets, there One is to count their elements: we obtain two nonneg a-tive integersm and n and just look at whether m < n, m = n, or m > n. But there is another important method, which does not require us to know the sizes of either A or B. This is to pair off elements from A with elements ofof elements: the first one to run out is the smaller set, B until one or other of the sets runs out and if there is a dead heat, then the sets have the same size.
for infinite sets as well: we can declare two sets tobe of equal size if there is a one-to-one correspon-A suitable modification of this second method works dence between them. This turns out to be an important and useful definition, though it does have some consequences that seem a little odd at first. For example, there is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and perfect squares: for each n correspond to n2. Thus, according to this definitionn we let there are “as many” squares as there are natural num - bers.
Similarly, we could show that there are as many primes as natural numbers by associating nth prime number.1 n with the large” asspondence between them. We just list the integers in What about N, but again we can find a one - to-one corre - Z? It seems that it should be “twice as the order 0,1,-1, 2, -2, 3, -3, . . . and then match the sity” that can be useful too. According to this definition, the even num-bers have density1. For sufficiently nice sets of integers there is a definition of “den - 1 , while the squares and the primes have density 0, as one might expect.
However, this is not the notion of size under discussion here. III.11. Countable and Uncountable Sets natural numbers with them in the obvious way: 1 with0, then 2 with 1, then 3 with - 1, then 4 with 2, then 5 with$-2$, and so on. size as the natural numbers. As the above example shows, this is exactly the same as saying that we can An infinite set is called countable if it has the same lista set asthe elements of the set. Indeed, if we have listed a , a , a , . . . , then our correspondence is just to send course many attempted listings that fail: for example, n1 to2(an)3.
It is worth noting that there are of for Z we might have tried-3, -2, -1,0,1,2,3,4, . . . . So it is important to recognize that when we say that aset is countable we are not saying that every attempt to list it works, or even that the obvious attempt does: we are merely saying that there is some way of listing the elements. This is in complete contrast to finite sets, where if we attempt to match up two sets and find some elements of one set left over, then we know that the two sets cannot be in one - to - one correspondence.
It isthis difference that is mainly responsible for the “odd consequences” mentioned above. Now that we have established that some sets that seem smaller or larger than N, such as the squares or the integers, are actually countable, let us turn toa set that seems “much larger,” namely Q. How could we hope to list all the rationals? After all, between anytwo of them you can find infinitely many others, so it seems hard not to leave some of them out when you try to list them. However, remarkable as it may seem, it is possible to list the rationals.
The key idea is that listing the rationals whose numerator and denominator are both smaller (in modulus) than some fixed number kis easy, as there are only finitely many of them. So we go through in order: first when both numerator and denominator are at most 1, then when they are at most 2, and so on (being careful not to relist any number, sothat for example 1 should not also appear as 2 or 3).
This leads to an ordering such as 03, -3,1, -1,2 ,-2 2,3 ,-3,4$,-4, . . . .,1,-1,2,-2^{4}$,1 2,-6 1 2, larger, such as, for example, the real numbers, such as We could use the same idea to list sets that look even3 3 3 3 2 2$\sqrt{2}$, that satisfy a polynomial algebraic numbers (all equation with integer coefficients). Indeed, we note that each polynomial has only finitely many roots (which are therefore listable), so all we need to do is list the polynomials (as then we can go through them, in order, listing their roots). And we can do that by applying the same technique again:
for eachd we list those polynomials of degree at most coefficients that are at mostd that we have not already listed, withd in modulus.

that Based on the above examples, one might well guess every infinite set is countable. But a beautiful argument ofment, shows that the real numbers are not countable.cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), called his “diagonal” argu We imagine that we have a list of all real numbers, sayr , r , r , . . . . Our aim is to show that this list cannot possibly contain all the reals, so we wish to construct areal that is not on this list. How do we accomplish this?1 2 3 We have each now we define a new number ri written as an infinite decimal, say, andsas follows.
For the first digit ofis not the first digit ofs (after the decimal point), we choose a digit thatr . Note that this already guaran- tees that recurring 9 s and the like, it is best to choose this firsts cannot equal1 r1. (To avoid coincidences with digit of digit ofss, we choose a digit that is not the second digit not to be 0 or 9 either.) Then, for the second oft inu ing in this way, we end up with a real number r2; this guarantees thats cannot be equal to r2. Con-s that is not on our list: what eve rn is, the number s cannot ber^n, as s and r^ndiffer in thenth decimal place!
“an infinite number of independent choices” to make One can use similar arguments any time that we have in specifying an object (like the various digits of example, let us use the same ideas to show that thes). For set of all subsets of N is uncountable. Suppose we have listed all the subsets as$A^{1}$, A2$, A3$, . . .. We will define a new set include the point 1 in B that is not equal to any of the B if and only if 1 does not belong An. So wetowe include 2 in A1 (this guarantees that B if and only if 2 does not belong to B is not equal to A1), and A , and so on.
It is amusing to note that one can write this set$B \text{down as} {n \in N}$:$n \in A$, which shows a striking2 resemblance to the set in Russell’s paradox.$n$ Countable sets are the “smallest” infinite sets. However, the set of real numbers is by no means the“largest” infinite set. Indeed, the above argument shows that no set den ce with the set of all its subsets. So the set of all X can be put into one-to-one correspon- subsets of the real numbers is “strictly larger” than theset of real numbers, and so on. The notion of countability is often a very fruitful one to bear in mind.
For example, suppose we want toknow whether or not all real numbers are algebraic. It is a genuinely hard exercise to write down a particu-lar real that is transcendental [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) (meaning not algebraic; seerem [V.22](/part-05/liouvilles-theorem-and-roths-theorem) for an idea of how it can be done), but the liouville’s theorem and roth’s theo above notions make it utterly trivial that transcenden-tal numbers exist. Indeed, the set of all real numbers is

172

uncountable but the set of algebraic numbers is count-able! Further more, this shows that “most” real numbers are transcendental: the algebraic numbers form only atiny proportion of the reals. III.12 C* - Algebras A[I.3 §2.3](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) and a banach space metric space[III.62](/part - 03/normed - spaces - and - banach - spaces) is both a[III.56](/part - 03/metric - spaces), and the study of vector space Banach spaces is therefore a mixture of linear algebra and analysis.
However, one can arrive at more sophisticated mixtures of algebra and analysis if one looks at Banach spaces that have more algebraic structure. In particular, while one can add two elements of a Banach space together, one cannot in general multiply them. However, some times one can: a vector space with a mul-tiplicative structure is called an algebra, and if the vector space is also a Banach space, and if the multipli-cation has the property thatxy ⩽ x . um y for any two elements bra.
(This name does not really reflect historical real-x and y , then it is called a Banach alge- ity, since the basic theory of Banach algebras was not worked out by Banach.

If, however, you have a roll of wallpaper and wish to flatten it, then there is no difficulty: you just unroll it. Surfaces such as spheres are said to be positively curved, ones with a saddle-like shape are like a piece of wallpaper are negatively curved flat. , and ones it does not lie in a plane.
This is because curvature is defined in terms of the Notice that a surface can be flat in this sense even ifintrinsic geometry of a surface, where distance is measured in terms of paths that lie inside the surface. There are various ways of making the above notion of curvature precise, and also quantitative, so that with each point of a surface one can associate a number that tells you “how curved” it is at that point. In order todo this, the surface must have a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) on it, which is used to determine the lengths of paths.
The notion of curvature can also be generalized to higher dimensions, so that one can talk about the curvature of a point in ad-dimensional Rieman- nian manifold. However, when the dimension is higher than 2, the way that the manifold can curve at a point is more complicated, and is expressed not by a single number but by the so-called Ricci tensor. See ricci flow [III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) for more details. Curvature is one of the fundamental concepts of modern geometry:
not only the notion just described but also various alternative definitions that measure in other ways how far a geometric object deviates from being flat. It is also an integral part of the theory of general relativity (which is discussed in general relativity and the einstein equations [IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)). III.14 Designs Peter J. Cameron Block designs were first used in the design of experiments in statistics, as a method for coping with sys-tematic differences in the experimental material.
Suppose, for example, that we want to test seven differ-ent varieties of seed in an agricultural experiment, and that we have twenty-one plots of land available for the experiment. If the plots can be regarded as identical, then the best strategy is clearly to plant three plots with each variety. Suppose, however, that the available plots are on seven farms in different regions, with three plots on each farm. If we simply plant one variety on each farm, we lose information, because we cannot dis-tinguish systematic differences between regions from

It is better to follow a scheme like this: plant varieties 1, 2, 3 on the first farm; 1, 4, 5 on the second; and then 1, 6, 7; 2, 4, 6; 2, 5, 7; 3, 4, 7; and 3, 5, 6. This design is represented in figure 1. block design sets of seed varieties used on the seven farms. The This arrangement is called a, or BIBD for short. The blocks are the balanced incomplete blocks are “incomplete” because not every variety canbe planted on every farm;
the design is “balanced” because each pair of varieties occurs in the same block the same number of times (just once in this case).This is a(7, 3, 1)design: there are seven varieties; each block contains three of them; and two varieties occur together in a block once.

In our we could not use a BIBD for the experiment, but would have to choose the most “efficient” possible design (allowing the most information to be obtained from the experimental results). A BIBD is most efficient if it exists; but not much is known in other cases. There are other types of design; these can be important to statistics and also lead to new mathematics. Here, for example, is an orthogonal array:

Design theory is closely related to other combinatorial topics such as error-correcting codes; indeed, Fisher “discovered” the Hamming codes as designs five years before R. W.
Hamming found them in the context of error correction. Other related subjects include pack-ing and covering problems, and especially finite geometry, where many finite versions of classical geometries can be regarded as designs.

In both cases, a minus sign seems to attach itself to the products for which the entries selected from the matrix “slope upward” rather than “downward.” definition totake sums and differences of all possible products of Up to a point it is easy to see how to extend thisn . imes  n matrices with n ⩾ 4. We simply none from each column. The difficulty comes in decid-entries, where one entry from each row is used and ing which of these products to add and which to sub-tract. To do this we take one of the products and use it to define a permutation follows.
For eachi ⩽ n, the product contains exactlyσ of the set \\{1,2, . . . , n\\} as one entry in thethenσ (i) = j. The product is added if this permutation ith row. If it belongs to the jth column is even and subtracted if it is odd (see groups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups)). So, for example, the permutation cor-permutation responding to the entry af h in the 3 . imes  3 determinant above sends 1 to 1, 2 to 3, and 3 to 2. This is an odd permutation, which is whyaf h receives a minus sign. products and minus signs that we have just defined is important.
The reason is that it tells us something We still need to explain why the particular choice of about the effect of a matrix when it is considered as a linear map. Let A be an n . imes  n matrix.

Let us give three of these properties. (i) Let V be a vector space[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and letα:$V \to V$ be a linear map.

Integration

Terence Tao

It goes with out saying that integration is one of the fundamental concepts of single-variable calculus. How-ever, there are in fact three concepts of integration that appear in the subject: the known as the antiderivative indefinite integral), the unsigned definite inte-f (also gral[a, b] f (x) dx(which one would use to find the area under a curve, or the mass of a one-dimensional object of varying density), and the signed definite integral compute the work required to move a particle fromab f (x) dx (which one would use, for instance, toa tob functions).
For simplicity we shall restrict our attention here tof: R\to  R that are continuous on the entire real line (and similarly, when we come to differential forms, we shall discuss only forms that are continuous on the entire domain). We shall also informally use terminology such as “infinitesimal” in order to avoid having to discuss the (routine) “epsilon–delta” analytical issues that one must resolve in order to make these integration concepts fully rigorous. closely related to each other in single-variable calcu - lus;
indeed, These three concepts of integration are of course the fundamental theorem of calculus [I.3 §5.5](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) relates the signed definite integralto any one of the indefinite integrals F = a bff (x)by thedx formula$bf (x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$, (1)

This makes the duality between curves and forms more symmetric.

Thus, the funda This turns out to be a general fact, valid for all mani-folds. Is the converse true:
that is, is every closed form exact? If the domain is a Euclidean space, or indeed any other simply connected manifold, then the answer is yes (this is a special case of theit is not true for general domains. In modern terminol-Poincaré lemma), but ogy, this demonstrates that the de Rham cohomology of such domains can be nontrivial. an object which we denote by As we have just seen, a 1-form can be thought of asω that associates with each pathω. Of course, ω is not justγ a scalar, any old function from paths to scalars:
it must sat-isfy the concatenation and reversing rules discussedγ earlier, and this, together with our continuity assump - tions, more or less forces it to be associated with some kind of continuously varying linear function that can beused, in combination withγ, to define an integral. Now let us see if we can generalize this basic idea from paths to stick to the two-dimensional case, that is, to int eg ratio nk-dimensional sets with k > 1.
For simplicity we shall of forms on (oriented) surfaces in Rn, since this already illustrates many features of the general case. Physically, such integrals arise when one is computing a across a surface. We parametrized one-dimensional ori-flux of some field (e.g., a magnetic field) ented curves as continuously differentiable functionsγ from the interval [0, 1] to Rn. It is thus natural to parametrize two-dimensional oriented surfaces as con - tinuous ly differentiable functionsφdefined on the unit square[0, 1]2.
This does not in fact cover all possible surfaces one wishes to integrate over, but it turns out that one can cut up more general surfaces into pieces that can be parametrized using “nice” domains suchas[0,1]2. inter valt In the one-dimensional case, we cut up the orientedto t [0=, 1]tinto infinitesimal oriented intervals from+ . elta t, which led to infinitesimal curves fromi xi + i 1= γ((ti)i) to xi + 1 = γ(ti + 1) = xi + . elta xi.

We have thus shown how to integrate 2-forms against oriented two-dimensional surfaces.
More generally, onecan define the concept of ak-form on an n-dimensional manifold (such as Rn) for any 0 ⩽ k ⩽ n and inte- grate this against an orientedin that manifold.

To see what this might mean, and in particular to seewhy dω is a (k + 1)-form, let us think how we might answer a question of the following kind. We are givena spherical surface in R3 and a flow, and we would like to know the net flux out of the surface: that is, the dif-ference between the amount of flux coming out and the amount going in. One way to do this would be to approximate the surface of the sphere by a union of tiny parallelograms, to measure the flux through each one, and to take the sum of all these fluxes.
another would be to approximate the solid sphere by a union of tiny parallelepipeds, to measure the net flux out of each of these, and to add up the results. If a parallelepiped is small enough, then we can closely approximate the net flux out of it by looking at the difference, for each pair of opposite faces, between the amount coming out ofthe parallelepiped through one and the amount going into it through the other, and this will depend on the rate of change of the 2-form.
parallelepipeds is more rigorously described as inte-The process of summing up the net fluxes out of the grating a 3-form over the solid sphere. In this way, onecan see that it is natural to expect that information about how a 2-form varies should be encapsulated in a 3-form. a little bit of algebra and is omitted here. However, The exact construction of these operations requires we remark that they obey similar laws to their scalar counterparts, except that there are some sign changes that are ultimately due to the antisymmetry (9).
For instance, if commutative law for multiplication becomesω is a k-form and η is an l - form, theω ∧ η = (-1)klη ∧ ω, 179 basically because dimensions with lkl dimensions; and the derivation rule swaps are needed to interchange k for differentiation becomes d(ω ∧ η) = (dω) ∧ η + (-1)kω ∧ (dη). Another rule is that the differentiation operator d isnilpotent: d(dω) = 0. (11) This may seem rather unintuitive, but it is fund a men-tally important. To see why it might be expected, let us think about differentiating a 1-form twice.
The orig-inal 1-form associates a scalar with each small line segment.
Its derivative is a 2-form that associates a scalar with each small parallelogram. This scalar essentially measures the sum of the scalars given by the 1-formas you go around the four edges of the parallelogram, though to get a sensible answer when you pass to the limit you have to divide by the area of the parallelo-gram. If we now repeat the process, we are looking at a sum of the six scalars associated with the six faces of a parallelepiped.
But each of these scalars in turn comes from a sum of the scalars associated with the four directed edges around the corresponding face, and each edge is therefore counted twice (as it belongs totwo faces), once in each direction. Therefore, the contributions from each edge cancel and the sum of all contributions is zero.
tween integrating a 2-form over the surface of a sphere The description given earlier of the relationship beand integrating its derivative over the solid sphere canbe thought of as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, and can itself be generalized considerably: Stokes’s theorem is the assertion that for any oriented manifold oriented boundary of SSd(which we will not define here).ωS=and form. artial S ω ω, where . artial S is the(12) Indeed one can view this theorem as a definition of the derivative operationω \to dω;
thus, differentiation is the identity (11) is dual to the geometric observation that adjoint of the boundary operation. (For instance, the the boundary boundary:. artial(. artial S). artial S = ∅of an oriented manifold itself has no.) As a particular case of Stokes’s theorem, we see that dω = 0 whenever S is a closed S manifold, i.e., one with no boundary. This observation lets one extend the notions of closed and exact forms to general differential forms, which (together with (11)) allows one to fully set up We have already seen that 0-forms can be identified de Rham cohomology.
with scalar functions. Also, in Euclidean spaces one can 180 use the inner product to identify linear functionals with vectors, and therefore 1-forms can be identified with vector fields. In the special (but very physical) case of three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, 2-forms can also be identified with vector fields via the famous hand rule,6 and 3-forms can be identified with scalar right functions by a variant of this rule.
(This is an exam-ple of a concept known as Hodge duality.) In this case, the differentiation operationω \to dω can be identi- fied with the0 - form, with the gradient curl operation operation Xf→ ∇ . imes→ ∇f Xwhenwhenωωis ais a 1 - form, and with the divergence operation X → ∇ · X when implies thatω is a 2 - form.

Just as the signed definite integral is connected to the unsigned definite integral in one dimension via(2), there is a connection between integration of
differential forms and the Lebesgue (or Riemann) inte-gral. On the Euclidean space Rn one has the n stan- dard coordinate functions Their derivatives dx , . . . , dxx1 are then 1-forms on, x2, . . . , xn: R$n \to RRn$..

Suppose we have a continuously differ en-tiable mapΦ:
X \to  Y from one manifold to another (we allow X and Yto have different dimensions). Then have used the left-hand rule to provide this identification, and a part from some harmless sign changes here and there, one gets essentially6. This is an entirely arbitrary convention; one could just as easily the same theory as a consequence.

Finally, any also pushes forward to a X, although in some cases (e.g., if the image ofk-dimensional oriented manifold Φ(S)Φ hasin dimension less than may be degenerate.k) this pushed-forward manifold between manifolds and forms. Since manifolds push forward under We have seen that integration is a duality pairingΦ from X to Y , we expect forms to pull back can define the from Y topullback X.

Similar definitions can be given for other differ en-tial forms. The pullback operation enjoys several nice properties: for instance, it respects the wedge product,

$Φ^{*}(ω ∧ η) = (Φ^{*}ω) ∧ (Φ^{*}η)$,

and the derivative,

d$(Φ^{*}ω) = Φ^{*}(dω)$.

By using these properties, one can recover rather painlessly the change-of-variables formulas in severalvariable calculus. More over, the whole theory carries over effortlessly from Euclidean spaces to other manifolds. It is because of this that the theory of differ-ential forms and integration is an indispensable tool in the modern study of manifolds, and especially in differential topology [IV.7](/part-04/dierential-topology). III.17 Dimension What is the difference between a two-dimensional set and a three-dimensional set?
A rough answer that one might give is that a two-dimensional set lives inside a plane, while a three-dimensional set fills up a portion of

III.17. Dimension

space. Is this a good answer? For many sets it does seemto be: triangles, squares, and circles can be drawn in a plane, while tetrahedra, cubes, and spheres cannot. But how about the surface of a sphere? This we would nor-mally think of as two dimensional, contrasting it with the solid sphere, which is three dimensional. But the surface of a sphere does not live inside a plane. Does this mean that our rough definition was in correct? Not exactly. From the perspective of linear alge-bra, the set\\{(x}, y, z):
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1, which is the surface of a sphere of radius 1 in R3 centered at the origin, contained in a plane. (One can express this in algebraicis three dimensional, precisely because it is not language by saying that the affine subspace generatedby the sphere is the whole of R3.) However, this sense of “three dimensional” does not do justice to the rough idea that the surface of a sphere has no thickness.
Surely there ought to be another sense of dimension in which the surface of a sphere is two dimensional?As this example illustrates, dimension, though very important through out mathematics, is not a single con - cept. There turn out to be many natural ways of generalizing our ideas about the dimensions of simple sets such as squares and cubes, and they are often incom-patible with one another, in the sense that the dimension of a set may vary according to which definition you use. The remainder of this article will set out a few different definitions.
set is that it is “the number of coordinates you need to specify a point.” We can use this to justify our instinct One very basic idea we have about the dimension of a that the surface of a sphere is two dimensional: youcan specify any point by giving its longitude and latitude. It is a little tricky to turn this idea into a rigorous mathematical definition because you can in fact specify a point of the sphere by means of just ber if you do not mind doing it in a highly artificial one numway.
This is because you can take any two numbers and interleave the digits to form a single number from which the original two numbers can be recovered. For instance, from the two numbers and e = 2.718281828 . . . you can form the numberπ = 3.141592653 . . .$32$.174\,118\,529\,821\,685\,238 . . ., and by taking alternate digits you get backto find a continuousπfunctionand e again.

Now let us take another intuitive notion and see what we can get from it. Suppose I want to cut a piece of paper into two pieces.
The boundary that separates the pieces will be a curve, which we would normally like to think of as one dimen - sional. Why is it one dimensional? Well, we could use the same reasoning: if you cut a curve into two pieces then the part where the two pieces meet each other is a single point (or pair of points if the curve is a loop), which is zero dimensional. That is, there appears to bea sense in which a(d - 1)-dimensional set is needed if you want to cut a Let us try to be slightly more precise about this idea.d-dimensional set into two. Suppose that X is a set and x and y are points in X .
Let us call a setis no continuous path from Y a barrier xbetweento y that avoid sx and y if there Y . For example, if center of X, and X is a solid sphere of radius 2, y is a point on the boundary ofx Xis the, then one possible barrier betwee nx and y is the surface of a sphere of radius 1. With this terminology in place, wecan make the following inductive definition. A finite set is zero dimensional, and in general we say that mostd dimensional if between any two points in XXthereis at is a barrier that is at most$(d - 1) dimensional$.
We also say that but not at most X is d dimensional(d - 1) dimensional.if it is at most d dimensional difficulties: one can construct a pathological set The above definition makes sense, but it runs into X that acts as a barrier between any two points in the plane, but contains no segment of any curve. This makes$X$ zero dimensional and therefore makes the plane one dimensional, which is not satisfactory.
A small modification to the above definition eliminates such patho lo-gies and gives a definition that was put forward by brouwer is said to have dimension at most[VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966).

Then you will be forced to make the shorter ones overlap, but you can do it in such a way that no point is contained in more than two of your intervals: just start each new interval close to the end of the previous one. (that is, one that does not contain its boundary) with smaller open squares. Again you will be forced to make Now suppose that you want to cover an open square the smaller squares overlap, but this time the situationis slightly worse: some points will have to be contained in three squares.
However, if you take squares arranged like bricks, as in figure 1, and expand them slightly, then you can do the covering in such a way that nofour squares overlap. In general, it seems that to cover a typical need to have overlaps ofd-dimensional set with small open sets, youd + 1 sets but you do not need to have overlaps greater than this. The precise definition that this leads to is surprisingly general: it makes sense not just for subsets of R$n$ but even for an arbitrary topological space [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces).

A fourth intuitive idea leads to concepts known as homological with any suitable topological space and cohomological dimension. Associated X, such as a man- ifold, are sequences of groups known asand cohomology groups [IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology). Here we will dis-homology cuss homology groups, but a very similar discussion is possible for cohomology.

If X is a manifold of dimension nth homology group is trivial: in a sense, there is not enough room in Xto define any map that is interestingly different from a constant map.

This thought leads to a whole class of definitions. The homological dimension of a structure Xis defined to be the largest nnth homology group.
(It is necessary to consider sub-for which some substructure of X has a nontrivial structures, because homology groups can also be trivial when there is too much room: it then becomes easy to deform a continuous map and show that it is equiva-lent to a constant map.) However, homology is a very general concept and there are many different homology theories, so there are many different notions of homo-logical dimension. Some of these are geometric, but there are also homology theories for algebraic struc-tures: for example, using suitable theories, one can

III.17. Dimension

define the homological dimension of algebraic struc-tures such as rings [III.81 §1](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) or groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). This is a very good example of geometrical ideas having an algebraic payoff. Now let us turn to a fifth and final (for this article at least) intuitive idea about dimension, namely the way it affects how we measure size. If you want to convey how big a shape X is, then a good way of doing so is to give the length oftwo dimensional, and the volume if it is three dimen-X if X is one dimensional, the area if it is sional.
Of course, this presupposes that you already know what the dimension is, but, as we shall see, there is a way of deciding which measure is the most appropriate Then the tables are turned: we can actually with out determining the dimension in advance.define the dimension to be the number that corresponds to the best measure. To do this, we use the fact that length, area, and volume scale in different ways when you expand a shape. If you take a curve and expand it by a factor of 2 (in all directions), then its length doubles.
More generally, ifyou expand by a factor of C, then the length multiplies by exp and it by C. However, if you take a two-dimensional shape and C, then its area multiplies by C2. (Roughly speaking, this is because each little portion of the shape expands by C“in two directions” so you have to multiply the area by dimensional shape multiplies by C twice.) And the volume of a three - C3: for instance, the volume of a sphere of radius 3 is twenty-seven times the volume of a sphere of radius 1.
advance whether we will talk about length, area, or vol-It may look as though we still have to decide in ume before we can even begin to think about how the measurement scales when we expand the shape. But this is not the case. For instance, if we expand a square by a factor of 2, then we obtain a new square that can be divided up into four congruent copies of the original square. So, with out having decided in advance that we are talking about area, we can say that the size of thenew square is four times that of the old square.
there are sets to which it is natural to assign a dimen-This observation has a remarkable consequence: sion that is not an integer! Perhaps the simplest exam-ple is a famous set first defined by cantor [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918) and now known as the follows. You start with the closed interval Cantor set. This set is produced as[0, 1], and call itdle third of$X0$. Then you form a set X: that is, you remove all points between X1 by removing the mid- union of the closed intervals13 and 23, but leave0 13 and 23$[0themselves$. So,1 3] and [2 3, 1]. Next, you X1 is the

Once you(Xn)+1 consists of twice as many have produced the sequence$n X^{0}$, X1$, X2$, . . ., you define the Cantor set to be the intersection of all the$X$: that

$i$

is, all the real numbers that remain, no matter how far you go with the process of removing middle thirds of intervals. It is not hard to show that these are precisely the numbers whose ternary expansions consist just of 0 s and 2 s. (There are some numbers that have two different ternary expansions. For instance, be written either as 0.1 or as 0.02222 . . .. In such case(s1)3 can we take the recurring expansion rather than the ter-minating one.
So 1 belongs to the Cantor set.) Indeed, when you remove middle thirds for the3 nth time, you are removing all numbers that have a 1 in the after the “decimal” (in fact, ternary) point.nth place The Cantor set has many interesting properties. For example, it issure [III.55](/part-03/measures) zero. Briefly, the first of these assertions uncountable [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets), but it also has meafollows from the fact that there is a different element of the Cantor set for every subset bers (just take the ternary number 0 A of the natural num-.a a a . .

Since the Cantor set is than zero. Thus, the Cantor set is very large in one respect( {}23)n, whatever nnis, which means that it must be and very small in another.
A further property of the Cantor set is that it is selfsimilar look at just one of these intervals as the middle thirds. The set X1 consists of two intervals, and if you are repeatedly removed, then what you see is just like the construction of the whole Cantor set, but scaled down by a factor of 3. That is, the Cantor set consists of two copies of itself, each scaled down by a factorof 3. From this we deduce the following statement:
if you expand the Cantor set by a factor of 3, then you can divide the expanded set up into two congruent copies of the original, so it is “twice as big.” What consequence should this have for the dimension of the Cantor set? Well, if the dimension isd, then

As we shall see in a moment, a theory of fractional dimension can be developed with the use-Once one knows this, the mystery of the Cantor set ful property that a countable union of sets of dimen-sion at mostd has dimension at most d. Therefore, the fact that the Cantor set has dimension greater than 0 implies that it cannot be countable (since single points have dimension 0).
On the other hand, because the dimension of the Cantor set is less than 1, it is much smaller than a one-dimensional set, so it is no surprise that its measure is zero. (This is a bit like saying thata surface has no volume, but now the two dimensions are 0.63 and 1 instead of 2 and 3.)The most useful theory of fractional dimension is one developed by hausdorff [VI.68](/part-06/felix-hausdor-18681942).
One begins with a concept known as Hausdorff measure, which is a nat-ural way of assessing the “$d$-dimensional volume” of a set, even ifin R3 and you want to work out its length by consider-d is not an integer. Suppose you have a curve ing how easy it is to cover it with spheres. A first idea might be to say that the length was the smallest you could make the sum of the diameters of the spheres. But this does not work: you might be lucky and find thata long curve was tightly wrapped up, in which case you could cover it with a single sphere of small diameter. spheres were required to be small.

Therefore, L as δ tends to 0, and we call Now suppose that we have a smooth surface in L the length of the curve. R3 and want to deduce its area from information about covering it with spheres.
This time, the area that you can cover with a very small sphere (so small that it meets only one portion of the surface and that portion is almost flat) will be roughly proportional to the square of the diameter of the sphere. But that is the only detail we need to change: letcan make the sum of the squares of the diameters of a A(δ) be the smallest we set of spheres that cover the surface, if all those spheres have diameter at mostδ. Then declare the area of the surface to be the limit of A(δ) as δ tends to 0.

In analysis, it is helpful to think Of course, all these notions of function and functionof the various notions of a function as forming a spec-trum, with very “smooth” classes of functions at one end and very “rough” ones at the other. The smooth classes of functions are very restrictive in their membership:
this means that they have good properties, and there are many operations that one can perform on them (such as, for example, differentiation), but it also means that one cannot necessarily ensure that the func-tions one is working with belong to this category. Conversely, the rough classes of functions are very general and inclusive: it is easy to ensure that one is working with them, but the price one pays is that the number of operations one can perform on these functions is often sharply reduced (see function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces)).
often be treated in a unified manner, because it is Nevertheless, the various classes of functions can often possible to approximate rough functions arbitrar-ily well (in an appropriate topology [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces)) by smooth ones. Then, given an operation that is naturally defined for smooth functions, there is a good chance that there will be exactly one natural way to extend it to an operation on rough functions: one takes a sequence of better and better smooth approximations to the rough func-tions, performs the operation on them, and passes to the limit.
rough end of the spectrum, but before we say what Distributions, or generalized functions, belong at the they are, it will be helpful to begin by considering some smoother classes of functions, partly for comparison and partly because one obtains rough classes of func-tions from smooth ones by a process known as duality: ais simply a linear map linear functional defined on a spaceφ from E to the scalars E of functions R or C. Typically, topology, and the E is a normed space, or at least comes with adual space is the space of continuous linear functionals.
The class Cω[-1, 1] of analytic functions. These are in many ways the “nicest” functions of all, and include many familiar functions such as exp(x), sin(x), poly - nomials, and so on. However, we shall not discuss them further, because for many purposes they form too rigida class to be useful. (For example, if an analytic func - 185 tion is zero every where on an interval, then it is forced to be zero every where.) The class C. nfty [-1, 1] of test functions.
These are the c smooth (that is, infinitely differentiable) functions defined on the interval[-1, 1], that vanish on neighbor - f , hoods of 1 andf$(x) = 0 whenever - 1$. (That is, one can findx > 1 - δ or x < -1δ >+ δ0 such that.) They are more numerous than analytic functions and therefore more tractable for analysis. For instance, it is often use-ful to construct smooth “cutoff functions,” which are functions that vanish out side some small set but do not vanish inside it.
Also, all the operations from calculus (differentiation, integration, composition, convolution, evaluation, etc.) are available for these functions. The class$C0[-1$, 1] of continuous functions. These functions are regular enough for the notion of evalua-tion,$x \to f (x)$, to make sense for every x \in  [-1, 1], and one can integrate such functions and perform algebraic operations such as multiplication and compo-sition, but they are not regular enough that operations such as differentiation can be performed on them. Still, they are usually considered among the smoother examples of functions
in analysis. The class L2[-1, 1] of square - integrable functions. These are measurable functions which the Lebesgue integral 1 f|f (x):[-|12, d1 x]is finite.$\to R for$ Usually one regards two such functions equal if the set ofx such that - 1 f (x) =f g(x)and ghasas measure zero.

Since a singletonx has measure zero, we can change the value ofout changing the function.
Thus, the notion of evalua - f (x) with- tion does not make sense for a square-integrable func - tionf (x)at any specific pointx.

However, as the class of analytic functions1,1] rather than against test functions g \in is so sparse, hyperfunctions tend not to be as useful inanalysis as distributions.

However, using this inner product, one on test functions, and duality.

III. Mathematical Concepts

for any test function a test function\mu = fg, then we can evaluate this using and distribution \mu. If \mu is itself integration by parts (recalling that test functions vanish at-1 and 1). We havef^ , g =-1 1 f^ (x)g(x) dx= −-1 1 f (x)g^ (x) dx = −f , g^ . Note that ifg is a test function, then so is g^ . We can therefore generalize this formula to arbitrary dis tr ibu-tions by defining\mu^, g = −\mu, g^. This is the justification for the differentiation of the Dirac distribution:δ^, g = −δ , g^ = −g^ (0).
More formally, what we have done here is to com - 0 0 pute the adjoint of the differentiation operation (as defined on the dense space of test functions). Then we have taken adjoints again to define the differentiation operation for general distributions. This proce-dure is well-defined and also works for many other concepts; for instance, one can add two distributions, multiply a distribution by a smooth function, convolve two distributions, and compose distributions on both the left and the right with suitably smooth functions.
One can even take Fourier transforms of distributions. For instance, the Fourier transform of the Dirac deltaδ is the constant function 1, and vice versa (this is essen - 0 tially the Fourier in version formula), while the dis tr ibu - tionδ (x - n) is its own Fourier transform (this is essentially the Poisson summation formula). Thus, n \in Z)0 the space of distributions is quite a good space to workin, in that it contains a large class of functions (e.g., all measures and integrable functions), and is also closed under a large number of common operations in analy-sis.
Because the test functions are dense in the space of distributions, the operations as defined on distributions are usually compatible with those on test func-tions. For instance, iff and g are test functions andf^  = g in the sense of distributions, then f^  = g will also be true in the classical sense. This often allows one to manipulate distributions as if they were test functions with out fear of confusion or inaccuracy.
The main operations one has to be careful about are evalua-tion and pointwise multiplication of distributions, both of which are usually not well-defined (e.g., the square of the Dirac delta distribution is not well-defined as a distribution). Another way to view distributions is as the weak limit of test functions. A sequence of functions converge weakly to a distribution\mu if f , gfn → is said to\mu, gn III.19. Duality for all test functions tion with total integralg.
For instance, if1 φ = 1, then the test func-φ is a test func- tions weakly to the Dirac delta distribution fn(x) = nφ(nx)-1 can be shown to convergeδ , while the functions derivativefδn^ (x)of the Dirac delta. On the other hand,= n2φ^ (nx) converge weakly to the0 the functionsto zero (this is a variant of the0$gn(x) = \cos (nx)φ(x)$ Riemann–lebesgue converge weakly lemma). Thus weak convergence has some unusual features not present in stronger notions of convergence, in that severe oscillations can some times “disappear” in the limit.
One advantage of working with dis tr ibu-tions instead of smoother functions is that one often has some compactness in the space of distributions under weak limits (e.g., by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem). Thus, distributions can be thought of as asymp-totic extremes of behavior of smoother functions, just as real numbers can be thought of as limits of rational numbers.
while still being closely connected to smoother func - tions, they have been extremely useful in the study of Because distributions can be easily differentiated, partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly when the equations are linear. For instance, the general solution to a linear PDE can often be described in terms of its fundamental solution, which solves the PDE in the sense of distributions.
More generally, distribution theory (together with related concepts, such as that of anot the only) means to define weak derivative) gives an important (though certainly generalized solutions of both linear and nonlinear PDEs. As the name suggests, these generalize the concept of smooth (orsolutions by allowing the formation of singularities, classical) shocks, and other nonsmooth behavior.
In some cases the easiest way to construct a smooth solution to a PDE is first to construct a generalized solution and then touse additional arguments to show that the generalized solution is in fact smooth.
 III.19 Duality Duality is an important general theme that has manifes-tat i ons in almost every area of mathematics. Over and over again, it turns out that one can associate with agiven mathematical object a related, “dual” object that helps one to understand the properties of the object one started with. Despite the importance of duality in mathematics, there is no single definition that covers all instances of the phenomenon. So let us look at a 187 few examples and at some of the characteristic features that they exhibit.
1 Platonic Solids Suppose you take a cube, draw points at the centers ofeach of its six faces, and let those points be the vertices of a new polyhedron. The polyhedron you get willbe a regular octahedron. What happens if you repeat the process? If you draw a point at the center of eachof the eight faces of the octahedron, you will find that these points are the eight vertices of a cube. We say that the cube and the octahedron are dual to one another. The same can be done for the other Platonic solids:
the dodecahedron and the icosahedron are dual to one another, while the dual of a tetrahedron is again a tetrahedron. The duality just described does more than just split up the five Platonic solids into three groups: it allows usto associate statements about a solid with statements about its dual. For instance, two faces of a dodecahe-dron are adjacent if they share an edge, and this is so if and only if the corresponding vertices of the dual icosahedron are linked by an edge. And for this reason there is also a correspondence between edges of the dodecahedron and edges of the icosahedron.
2 Points and Lines in the Projective Plane There are several equivalent definitions of the projective plane that it is the set of all lines in[I.3 §6.7](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions). One, which we shall use here, is R3 that go through the origin. These lines we call the “points” of the projec-tive plane. In order to visualize this set as a geometrical object and to make its “points” more point - like, itis helpful to associate each line through the origin with the pair of points in R3 at which it intersects the unit sphere:
indeed, one can define the projective plane asthe unit sphere with opposite points identified. all “points” (that is, lines through the origin) that lie insome plane through the origin. This is associated with A typical “line” in the projective plane is the set of the great circle in which that plane intersects the unit sphere, once again with opposite points identified. points in the projective plane:
each point P is associated with the line L that consists of all points orthogonal to There is a natural association between lines and P, and each line L is associated with the single point P that is orthogonal to all points in L. For example, if P isthez - axis, then the associated projective line L is the set of all lines through the origin that lie in thexy - plane, 188 and vice versa. This association has the following basic property:
if a point P belongs to a line L, then the line associated with P contains the point associated with L.This allows us to translate statements about points and lines into logically equivalent statements about lines and points. For example, three points are collinear (that is, they all lie in a line) if and only if the corre-sponding lines are concurrent (that is, there is some point that is contained in all of them). In general, once you have proved a theorem in projective geometry, you get another, dual, theorem for free (unless the dual theorem turns out to be the same as the original one).
3 Sets and Their Complements Let ple ment X be a set. Ifof A, written A is any subset of Ac, is the set of all elements of X, then the com-X that do not belong to ple ment of A is clearly A. The complement of the com-A, so there is a kind of dual- ity between sets and their complements.laws are the statements that$(A ∩ B)c =$ De Morgan’s Ac ∪ Bc and(A ∪ B)c = Ac ∩ Bc: they tell us that complement at i on “turns intersections into unions,” and vice versa. Notice that if we apply the first law to Ac and Bc, then we find that(Ac ∩ Bc)c = A ∪ B.
Taking complements of both sides of this equality gives us the second law. ing unions and intersections remains true when you interchange them. For example, one useful identity is Because of de Morgan’s laws, any identity involv$A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)$. Applying this to the complements of the sets and using de Morgan’s laws, itis straightforward to deduce the equally useful identity

$A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)$. 4 Dual Vector Spaces Let space V be a V^*is defined to be the set of all vector space [I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), over linear functionals R, say. The dual on$V$: that is, linear maps from V to R. It is not hard to define appropriate notions of addition and scalar mul-tiplication and show that these make$V^{*} \text{into a vector}$ space as well. Suppose that T is a linear map[I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) from a vector spacementw* of the dual space V to a vector space W W*, then we can use.
If we are given an ele-T and wth at takes* to create an element ofv to the real number V*as follows: it is the map$w^{*}(T v)$. This map, which is denoted byear. The function T*T*is itself a linear map, called thew*, is easily checked to be lin- adjoint of$V^{*}$. of T, and it takes elements of W* to elements

III. Mathematical Concepts

object This is a typical feature of duality: a function A to object B very often gives rise to a functionf fromg from the dual of Suppose that T*Bis a surjection. Then ifto the dual of A. v = v^ , we can find$v^{*} \text{such that} v^{*}(v) = v^{*}(v)$, and thenw T^*^*w\in^*(v W^*^ ), and therefore such that T*w*w=*v(T v)*, so that = w*T(T v*w*)(v). This= implies that tion. We can also prove that if T v = T v^ , which proves that T* is an injection, then T is an injec-T is a surjection.
Indeed, if T is not a surjection, then T Va nonzero linear functional is a proper subspace of Ww*, which allows us to find such that w*(T v) = 0 for every contradicts the injectivity ofv \in V , and hence such that T*. If VTand*w*W=are finite0, which dimensional, then that T is an injection if and only if(T*)* = T, so in this case we find T* is a surjection, and vice versa. Therefore, we can use duality to convert an existence problem into a uniqueness problem. This conversion of one kind of problem into a different kind is another characteristic and very useful feature of duality.
tion of the dual space may well change. For instance, if XIf a vector space has additional structure, the defini-is a real [III.62](/part - 03/normed - spaces - and - banach - spaces), then X*is defined to be the space of all from X to Rbanach space, rather than the space of continuous linear functionals all linear func- tionals. This space is also a Banach space: the norm of a continuous linear functional$\sup {|f (x)|}$:$x \in X$, x ⩽ 1.
If X is an explicit exam-fis defined to be ple of a Banach space (such as one of the spaces dis-cussed in function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces)), it can be extremely useful to have an explicit description of the dual space. That is, one would like to find an explicitly described Banach space Y and a way of associating with each nonzero element functionalφdefined ony of Y a nonzero continuous linear X, in such a way that every continuous linear functional is equal to$y \in Y$.y φy for some and From this perspective, it is more natural to regard Yas having the same status.
We can reflect this in$X$ our notation by writing do this, then we are drawing attention to the fact that$x$, y instead of φy(x). If we the map number·x, y, ·, which takes the pair, is a continuous bilinear map from(x, y) to the real X . imes Y to R. More generally, whenever we have two mathematical objects a function A andβ: AB, a set . imes B \to SSof “scalars” of some kind, and that is a structure-preserving map in each variable separately, we can think of the III.19. Duality elements of versa. Functions like A as elements of the dual ofβ are called pairings.

Further more, if X.
It is not hard to check that X is closed andn = 3 and X is a Platonic solid centered at the origin, then X◦ is (a multiple of) the dual Platonic solid, and ifball” of a normed space (that is, the set of all points of$X$is the “unit norm at most 1), then$X^{\circ}$is (easily identified with) the unit ball of the dual space. 6 Duals of Abelian Groups if homomorphism from G is an Abelian group, then a G to the group character T of all complex on G is a numbers of modulus 1.
Two characters can be multi-plied together in an obvious way, and this multiplication makes the set of all characters on Abelian group, called the dual group, ˆG, of the group G into another G. Again, if imposes an additional continuity condition. G has a topological structure, then one usually An important example is when the group is itself T. It is not hard to show that the continuous homomor-phisms from T to T all have the form eiθ \to (ei)nθ for some integer the dual of Tnis (isomorphic to)(which may be negative or zero). Thus, Z.
tryagin duality ing between This form of duality between groups is called$G$. Note that there is an easily defined pair-and ˆ$G$: given an element$g \in G \text{and a Pon}-$ character$ψ \in G$ˆ, we defineg, ψ to be ψ(g). functions$G$ˆ Under suitable conditions, this pairing extends toare finite, and defined onf G: and ˆG \to G. For instance, if C and F: ˆ$G G \to and C$, then we can define|G|-1 f (g)F(ψ)f , F to be the complex number.
In general, one obtains a pairing between a complex functions on$g \in^{G} G^{ψ} \in$and a Hilbert space of functions on ˆGˆ hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) of G. duality. Given a function in the Hilbert space its This extended pairing leads to another important Fourier transform is the function ˆf \in (ZL)2 that(T), is defined by the formula f (n)ˆ= 21π0 2 π f ((ei)θ)(e-i)nθ dθ. The Fourier transform, which can be defined similarly for functions on other Abelian groups, is immensely

useful in many areas of mathematics. (See, for exam-ple, fourier transforms [III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) and representation theory examples, it is[IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory).) By contrast with some of the previous not always easy to translate a statement about a function about its Fourier transform ˆf into an equivalent statementf , but this is what gives the Fourier transform its power: if you wish to under-stand a function fdef in ed on T, then you can explore its properties by looking at both$f$and ˆf .
Some proper- ties will follow from facts that are naturally expressedin terms off and others from facts that are naturally expressed in terms of ˆ“doubles one’s mathematical power.”f . Thus, the Fourier transform 7 Homology and Cohomology Let If MX andbe a compact M^  are ann-dimensional i-dimensional submanifold and manifold[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). an(n - i)-dimensional submanifold of X, respectively, and if they are well-behaved and in sufficiently general position, then they will intersect in a finite set of points.
If one assigns either 1 or-1 to each of these points in a natural way that takes account of howand M^  intersect, then the sum of the numbers at the M points is an invariant called the M and M^ . This number turns out to depend only on intersection number of theit defines a map from homology classes H (X)[IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of. imes  H^- (X)M andto Z, where we M^ .

distributions rigorous definitions of function-like objects such as the[III.18](/part-03/distributions) shows how to use duality to give Dirac delta function. The article on[IV.16](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) discusses an astonishing (and still largely con-mirror symmetry jectural) duality between and so-called “mirror manifolds.” Often the mirror calabi–yau manifolds [III.6](/part-03/calabiyau-manifolds) manifold is much easier to understand than the origi-nal manifold, so this duality, like the Fourier transform, makes certain calculations possible that would otherwise be unthinkable.
And the article ontion theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) discusses the “Langlands dual” of represent a certain (non-Abelian) groups: a proper understanding of this duality would solve many major open problems. III.20 Dynamical Systems and Chaos From a scientific point of view, a dynamical system is a physical system, such as a collection of planets or the water in a canal, that changes over time.
Typically, the positions and velocities of the parts of such a system at a time ties of those parts just before that time, which meanst depend only on the positions and veloci- that the behavior of the system is governed by a system of partial differential equations [I.3 §5.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Often, a very simple collection of partial differential equations can lead to very complicated behavior of the physical system.

Some times, as above, “just beforehand” refers toa time infinitesimally earlier, which is why calculus is involved. But there is also a vigorous theory of discrete dynamical systems, where the “time”values, and the “time just before$t$” istt-takes integer1.
If f is the function that tells us how the system at timeon the system at timet - 1, then the system as a wholet depends can be thought of as the process ofapplyingf over and over again. iterating f: that is, function iterate it enough times.

it), which means that one has to make do with approx-imations. Because the relevant equations are chaotic, the resulting inaccuracies, which may be small to start with, rapidly propagate and overwhelm the system: you could start with a different, equally good approximation and find that after a fairly short time the system had evolved in a completely different way. This is why accurate forecasting is impossible more than a few days in advance. For more about dynamical systems and chaos, see dynamics [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics). III.21 Elliptic Curves Jordan S.

In this sense, an ellip- inition has given rise to a subject of seemingly inexhaustible mathematical interest, which has provided atremendous fund of ideas, examples, and problems in number theory and algebraic geometry. This is in part because there are many values of “$X$” for which it is the case that “the simplest interesting example of X is an elliptic curve.”For instance, the points of an elliptic curve E with coordinates in which we call E(K)K naturally form an Abelian group,.
The connected projective vari- eties [III.95](/part-03/varieties) that admit a group law of this kind are called the Abelian varieties that are one dimensional. The Abelian varieties; and elliptic curves are just Mordell–Weil theorem tells us that, when field and A is an Abelian variety, A(K)Kis actually ais a number finitely generated group; these Abelian groups are much studied but Abelian group, called a Mordell–Weil have retained much of their mystery (see rational points on curves and the mordell conjecture[V.29](/part-05/rational-points-on-curves-and-vi40-ernst-eduard-kummer-18101893)).
Even when A is an elliptic curve, in which case we would call itdo not know, though E instead, there is a great deal that wethe birch–swinnerton-dyer conjecture [V.4](/part-05/the-birchswinnerton-dyer-conjecture) offers a conjectural formula for the

Continued Fractions

Keith Ball

1 The Euclidean Algorithm

the fundamental theorem of arithmetic [V.14](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic),

which states that every integer can be factored into primes in a unique way, has been known since antiquity. The usual proof depends upon what is known as the Euclidean algorithm, which constructs the highest common factor (h, say) of two numbers m and n. In doing so, it shows thatam+ bn for some pair of integer sh can be written in the forma, b (not necessarily positive). For example, the highest common factor of 17 and 7 is 1, and sure enough we can express 1 as the combination 1= 5 . imes 17 - 12 . imes 7. The algorithm works as follows.
Assume thatm is larger than quotientq nand a nonnegative remainder and start by dividing m byr nthat is lessto yield a than$n$. Then we hav(e1)1 m = q1 n + r1. (1)

Now since second quotient and remainder: r1 < n we may divide n by r1 to obtain an = q2 r1 + r2. (2)

Continue in this way, dividingon. The remainders get smaller each time but cannot$r^{1} by r^{2}$, r2 by r3, and so go below zero. So the process must stop at some point with a remainder of 0: that is, with a division that comes out exactly. For instance, if$m = 165 and n = 70$, the algorithm generates the sequence of divisions 165$= 2 \times 70 + 25$, (3) 70$= 2 \times 25 + 20$, (4) 25$= 1 \times 20 + 5$, (5)$20$= 4 . imes 5 + 0. (6)

192

The process guarantees that the last nonzero remain-der, 5 in this case, is the highest common factor of$m$ andn. On the one hand, the last line shows that 5 is a factor of the previous remainder 20. Now the last-but-one line shows that 5 is also a factor of the remainder 25 that occurred one step earlier, because 25 isexpressed as a combination of 20 and 5. Working back up the algorithm we conclude that 5 is a factor of bothm = 165 and n = 70. So 5 is certainly a common factor of On the other hand, the last-but-one line shows thatm and n.
5 can be written as a combination of 25 and 20 with integer coefficients. Since the previous line shows that 20 can be written as a combination of 70 and 25 we can write 5 in terms of 70 and 25: 5$= 25 - 20 = 25 - (70 - 2 \times 25) = 3 \times 25 - 70$. Continuing back up the algorithm we can express 25 in terms of 165 and 70 and conclude that 5$= 3 \times (165 - 2 \times 70) - 70 = 3 \times 165 - 7 \times 70$. of 165 and 70 because any factor of 165 and 70 would automatically be a factor of 3 This shows that 5 is the. imes highest165 - 7 common factor. imes70: that is, a factor of 5.
Along the way we have shown that the high-est common factor can be expressed as a combination of the two original num be rsm and n. 2 Continued Fractions for Numbers During the 1500 years following Euclid, it was realizedby mathematicians of the Indian and Arabic schools that the application of the Euclidean algorithm to a pairof integersm and n could be encoded in a formula for the ratiom/n. The equation (1) can be written mn = q1 + rn1 = q1 + F1 ,

where$F = n/r^{1}$. Now equation (2) expressesr2 F as F = q2 + r1.

The next step of the algorithm will produce an expres-sion forr /r and so on. If the algorithm stops afterk steps, then we can put these expressions together t(o1)2 get what is called the continued fraction for$m/n$:

The numbers 3, 7, 15, and so on, that appear in the fraction are called the The continued fraction for a real number can be used partial quotients ofπ. to approximate it by rational numbers. If we truncate the continued fraction after several steps, we are left with a finite continued fraction which is a rational num-ber: for example, by truncating the fraction (7), one level down we get the familiar approximation3$+ 1/7 = 22/$7; at the second level we get the approx-$π \approx$ imation 3$+ 1/(7 + 1/15) = 333/106$.
The truncations at different levels thus generate a sequence of rational approximations: the sequence forπ begins$3$, 22/7, 333/106, 355/113, . . . .

For example, the infinite series exponential function [III.25](/part - 03/the - exponential - and - logarithmic - functions) has the e$x = 1 + x + x22 + · · · + xnn!$+ · · ·.
There are also a number of functions that have sim-ple continued-fraction expansions: continued fractions involving a variable like important continued fractions historically.x. These are probably the most For example, the functionx \to  . an  x has the contin- ued fraction

valid for any value ofples ofπ/2, where the tangent function has a ver ti calx other than the odd multi- asymptote. Where as the infinite series of a function can be truncated to provide function, truncation of the continued fraction provides polynomial approximations to the approximations byare ratios of polynomials. For instance, if we truncate rational functions: functions that the fraction for the tangent after one level, then we getthe approximation . an x . pprox 1 - xx2/3 = 3 - 3 xx2.
This continued fraction, and the rapidity with which its truncations approach tanx, played the central role in the proof that two whole numbers. The proof was found by Johannπis irrational: thatπ is not the ratio of Lambert in the 1760 s. He used the continued fractionto show that ifx is a rational number (other than 0), then tanx is not. But tanπ/4 = 1 (which certainly is rational), soπ/4 cannot be. III.23 The Euler and Navier–Stokes

Applying this remark to th(e R)n Fθ dx = 0 for 3 D Navier–Stokes equations (2) and (3) and performing a simple formal computation (an integration by parts), we find that (2) and (3) are equivalent to the following equations:

It has been known for a long time how to construct suitable weak solutions of 3 D Navier–Stokes, butthe uniqueness of these solutions has not been proved. Thanks to the work of Sheffer, of Lin, and of Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg, it is known that any suitable weak solution to 3 D Navier–Stokes must be smooth (i.e., it must possess derivatives of all orders), out side a set E ⊂ R3 . imes (0,. nfty ) of small [III.17](/part - 03/dimension).

A two-dimensional fluid that is initially at rest and subject to no out side forces can suddenly start moving in a bounded region of space and then return to rest. Such behavior can occur for a weak solution of 2 D Euler. The Navier–Stokes and Euler equations give rise to a number of fundamental problems in addition to the breakdown problem discussed above. We finish this article with one such problem.
Suppose that we fix an initial velocity u0(x)for the 3 D Navier–Stokes or Euler equation. The energy E^0 at time t = 0 is given by E^0 = 12^R^3 |u(x, 0)|^2 dx.

2 The Existence of Expanders

The first person to prove that expanders exist was Pinkser, who proved that ifn is large and d ⩾ 3, then almost every an expander. That is, he proved that there is a con-d-regular graph with n vertices is stant$c >$0 such that for every fixed$d ⩾ 3$, the pro- portion ofnot expanders tends to zero asd-regular graphs with nn tends to infinity.vertices that are This proof was an early example of the probabilistic method see that if a[IV.19 §3](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics) in combinatorics.
It is not hard tod-regular graph is chosen uniformly at ran- dom, then the S is d|S|(n − |expected S|)/n, which is at least number of edges leaving a set(1 d)|S|. Stan- dard “tail estimates” are then used to prove that, forany fixed S, the probability that the number of edges2 leaving value is extremely small: so small that if we add up the Sis significantly different from its expected probabilities for all sets, then even the sum is small. So with high probability all sets S have at least c|S| edges to their complement. (In one respect this descrip-tion is misleading:
it is not a straightforward matter to discuss probabilities of events concerning random ddently chosen. However, Bollobás has defined an equiv--regular graphs because the edges are not in de pen a le nt model for random regular graphs that allows them to be handled.)Note that this proof does not give us an explicit description of any expander: it merely proves that they exist in abundance.
This is a drawback to the proof, because, as we shall see later, there are applications for expanders that depend on some kind ofexplicit description, or at least on an efficient method of producing expanders. But what exactly is an “explicit description” or an “efficient method”? There are many possible answers to this question, of which we shall discuss two.
The first is to demand that there is an algorithm that can list, for any integer edges of ad-regular c-expander with aroun dn, all the vertices andn vertices (we could be flexible about this and ask for the num-ber of vertices to be between$n and n^{2}$, say) in a time that is polynomial inity [IV.20 §2](/part-04/computational-complexity) for a discussion of polynomial-time algo-n. (See computational complex- rithms.) Descriptions of this kind are some times called “mildly explicit.” the following graph.
Its vertices are all 01 sequencesof length To get an idea of what is “mild” about this, con side rk, and two such sequences are joined by an edge if they differ in exactly one place. This graph issometimes called the discrete cube ink dimensions. It 197 has 2 k vertices, so the time taken to list all the ver- tices and edges will be huge compared with ever, for many purposes we do not actually need suchk. How- a list: what matters is that there is a concise way of representing each vertex, and an efficient algorithm for listing the (representations of the) neighbors of any given vertex.
Here the 01 sequence itself is a very con-cise representation, and given such a sequenceσ it is very easy to list, in a time that is polynomial in rather than 2 k, the k sequences that can be obtained byk altering described in this way (so that listing the neighbors ofσin one place. Graphs that can be efficiently a vertex takes a time that is polynomial in the logarithm explicit of the number of vertices) are called.
strongly The quest for explicitly constructed expanders has been the source of some beautiful mathematics, which has often used ideas from fields such as number theory and algebra.
The first explicit expander was discovered by Margulis. We give his construction and another one; we stress that although these constructions are very simple to describe, it is rather less easy to prove that they really are expanders. for every integer Z Margulis’s construction gives an 8-regular graph is the set of all integers modm. The vertex set ism. The neighbors of Z^m . imes  Z^m, where G^m the vertex(x$, y^{m} - x)$,(x$, y)(x + yare + 1(x, y)+, y, y)(x - y, (x + 1-, y)y, y)$, (x$, y, (x, y + x++x)1)$,,(x, y - x + 1) (all operations are mod m).
Margulis’s proof thattation theory Gm is an expander was based on[IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) and did not provide any specific re pre sen bound on the expansion constant later derived such a bound us in gc harmonic analy-. Gabber and Galil sis explicit.[IV.11](/part-04/harmonic-analysis). Note that this family of graphs is strongly 3-regular graph with set is Another construction provides, for each prime Z , and a vertex px vertices. This time the vertex is connected to x + 1, x p-, a1, and define the inverse of 0 to be 0).
The proof that these(x-1)p (where this is the inverse of x mod p, and we graphs are expanders depends on a deep result in num-ber theory, called the Selberg 3/16 theorem. This family is only mildly explicit, since we are at present unable togenerate large primes deterministical ly. itly constructing expanders were algebraic. However, in Until recently, the only known methods for explic2002 Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson introduced theso-called zigzag product of graphs, and used it to give a combinatorial, iterative construction of expanders.
198 3 Expanders and Eigenvalues The condition that a graph should be a involves all subsets of the vertices. Since there are expo - c-expander nent i ally many subsets, it would seem on the face ofit that checking whether a graph is ac-expander is an exponentially long task. And, indeed, this problem turns out to be co-np complete [[IV.20 §§3, 4]](/part - 04/computational - complexity). However, we shall now describe a closely related property that can be checked in polynomial time, and which is in some ways more natural.
A Given a graph is the n . imes  n matrix where G with n vertices, its Auvis defined to be 1 ifadjacency matrix uand symmetric, and therefore hasis joined to v and 0 otherwise. This matrix is realn real eigenvalues [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)thatλ ⩾λ1λ, λ2⩾, . . . , λ· · ·n⩾, which we name in such a wayλ . More over, eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.1 2$n$ of useful information about this, let us briefly consider how It turns out that these eigenvalues encode a great deal G.
But before we come to A acts as a linear map. If we are given a function G, then Af is the function whose value atf, defined on the vertices ofu is the sum of immediately that iff (v) over all neighbors G is d-regular andv of u. From this we seef is the function that is 1 at every vertex, thend at every vertex. In other words, a constant function Af is the function that is is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue d. It is also not hard to see that this is the largest possible eigenvalue$λ^{1}$, and that if the graph is connected, then the second largest eigenvalueλ2 will be strictly less than d.

From this it follows thatc lies between an infinite family ofexpanders if and only if there is some constant2 2 d-regular graphs is a family of2 a > 0 such that the spectral gapsd - λ2 are at least a for every graph in the family.
One of the many reasons these bounds onc are important is that although, as we have remarked, it is hard to test whether a graph is a computed in polynomial time. So we can at least obt a inc-expander, its second largest eigenvalue can be estimates for how good the expansion properties of agraph are. Another important parameter of ad-regular graph Gfromis the largest absolute value of any eigenvalue apartλ1; this parameter is denoted byλ(G). If λ(G) is

If G were random, a small calcu- lation shows that we would expect the number of edges from A to B to be about d|A| |B|/n. It can be E(A, B) shown that, for any two disjoint sets in anyd-regular graph by at most G, E(A, B)λ(G)will differ from this expected amount|A| |B|. Therefore, if λ(G) is a small fraction ofd, then between any two reasonably large setswe expect.

The fact that expanders are highly connected means that such a network is highly“fault tolerant,” in the sense that one cannot cut off part of the network with out destroying a large number of individual communication lines.

III.25 The Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 1 Exponentiation The following is a very well-known mathematical se - quence:
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,. . .. Each term in this sequence is twice the term before, so, for instance, 128, the seventh term in the sequence, is equal to 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2. Since repeated multipli- ca tions of this kind occur through out mathematics, itis useful to have a less cumbersome notation for them, so 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 is normally written as 27, which we read as “2 to the power 7” or just “2 to the 7.”More generally, ifa is any real number and m is any positive integer, thenam stands for a

(The num berm is called the expo- following identity:$am + n = am · an$This says that exponentiation “turns addition into mul - tiplication.” It is easy to see why this identity must be true if one looks at a small example and temporarily reverts to the old, cumbersome notation.
For instance, 27 = 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2= (2 . imes 2 . imes 2). imes (2 . imes 2 . imes 2 . imes 2)= 23 . imes 24. Suppose now that we are asked to evaluate 23$/2$.

The idea of multi - However, mathematicians like to generalize, and even ifwe cannot immediately make sense of 2 m except when 200 minventing a meaning for it for a wider class of numbers.is a positive integer, there is nothing to stop us The more natural we make our generalization, the more interesting and useful it is likely to be. And theway we make it natural is to ensure that at all costs we keep the property of “turning addition into multiplication.” This, it turns out, leaves us with only one sensi-ble choice for what 23/2 should be.
If the fundamental property is to be preserved, then we must have 23$/2 · 23/2 = 23/2 \sqrt{} + 3/2 = 23 = 8$. Therefore, 23/2 has to be ± 8. It turns out to be con- ven ient to take 2 be$\sqrt{8}$.3 / 2 to be positive, so we define 23/2 to A similar argument shows that 20 should be defined to be 1: if we wish to keep the fundamental property$, then 2$= 21 = (21)+0 = 21 · 20 = 2 · 20. Dividing both sides by 2 gives the answer 20= 1. What we are doing with these kinds of arguments is solving awhere the unknown is a function.
So that we can see this functional equation, that is, an equation more clearly, let us write$f (t) for 2t$. The information we are given is the fundamental proper tyf (t)f (u) together with one value, f (1) = f (t2, to get us+ u) = started. From this we wish to deduce as much as we canaboutf . we have placed on It is a nice exercise to show that the two conditionsf determine the value of f at every rational number, at least iftive.
For instance, to show thatf is assumed to be posi-f (0) should be 1, we note that$f (0)f (1) = f (\sqrt{1})$, and we have already shown that similar spirit to these arguments, and the conclusionf (3/2) must be 8. The rest of the proof is in a is thatf (p/q) must be the qth root of 2 p. More gener- ally, the only sensible definition ofof$a^{p}$. ap/q is the qth root functional equation, but we have made sense of We have now extracted everything we can from the$a^{t} only$ iftion when tis a rational number. Can we give a sensible defini-$t$is irrational?
For example, what would be the most natural definition of 2 equation alone does not determine what 2$\sqrt{}^{2}$?

Alternatively, one can assume[I.3 §5.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). used to work out 2 directly but to obtain better and better Let us see how the first property can in principle be. qrt2.

It follows that as we choose frac-tions the resulting numbers 2 p/q and r /s that are closer and closer together, sop/q and 2 r /s converge to some limit, and this limit we call 2. qrt2. 2 The Exponential Function One of the hallmarks of a truly important concept in mathematics is that it can be defined in many different but equivalent ways.
The exponential function . xp most basic way to think of it, though for most purposes(x)very definitely has this property. Perhaps the not the best, is that exp(x) = ex, where e is a number whose decimal expansion begins 2 we focus on this number? One property that singles it.7182818. Why do out is that if we differentiate the function exp then we obtain e xagain—and e is the only number for$(x) = e^{x}$, which that is true. Indeed, this leads to a second way ofdefining the exponential function:
it is the only solution of the differential equationf^ (x) = f (x)that satisfies the initial conditionf (0) = 1. chosen in textbooks, is as the limit of a power series: A third way to define exp(x), and one that is often. xp (x) = 1 + x + x2!2$+ x3!3$+ · · ·, known as the Taylor series of exp(x). It is not immedi- ately obvious that the right-hand side of this definition gives us some number raised to the powerx, which is why we are using the notation expex.
However, with a bit of work one can verify that it(x) rather than yields the basic properties exp$(x + y) = \exp (x) \exp (y)$,. xp (0) = 1$, and (d/dx) \exp (x) = \exp (x)$. There is yet another way to define the exponential function, and this one comes much closer to telling uswhat it really means. Suppose you wish to invest some money for ten years and are given the following choice: either you can add 100% to your investment (that is, double it) at the end of the ten years, or each year you can take whatever you have and increase it by 10%.Which would you prefer?

III.25. The Exponential and Logarithmic Functions The second is the better investment because in the second case the interest isyou start with 100, then after a year you will have 110 compounded: for instance, if and after two years you will have $121$. The increase of11 in the second year breaks down as 10% interest on the original 100 plus a further dollar, which is 10% interest on the interest earned in the first year. Under the second scheme, the amount of money you end up with is $100 timesby 1$.1.
The approximate value of(1.1)10, since each year it multiplies(1.1)10 is 2.5937, so you will get almost 260 instead of200. Instead of multiplying your investment by 1 times, you would multiply it by 1 What if you compounded your interest monthly?1 120 times. By the101 ten end of ten years your 100 would have been multiplied by(1 +1 )120, which is approximately 2120 .707. If you compounded it daily, you could increase this to approx-120 imately 2.718, which is suspiciously close to e.

Here is a sketch of an argument that shows that if we define exp property that we need if our definition is to be a good(x) in this way, then we obtain the main one, namely exp$(x) \exp (y) = \exp (x + y)$. Let us take$1$+ nx^n 1 + yn^n, which equals 1+ xn + yn + xyn^2^n. Now the ratio of 1 y/n is smaller than 1+ x/n+ xy/n+ y/n^2, and+ xy/n(1 +^2 xy/nto 1 +^2 x/n)^n can+ be shown to converge to 1 (as here the increase inis not enough to compensate for the rapid decrease in$nxy/n^{2})$.

3 Extending the Definition to Complex Numbers

If we think of exp(x) as ex, then the idea of generalizing the definition to complex numbers seems hope less: our intuition tells us nothing, the functional equation does not help, and we cannot use continuity or order rela-tions to determine it for us. However, both the power series and the compound-interest definitions can be generalized easily.
Ifz is a complex number, then the most usual definition of exp(z) is$1$+ z + z2!2$+ z$3!3$+ · · ·$.$Settingz = iθ$, for a real number θ, and splitting the resulting expression into its real and imaginary parts, we obtain 1- θ2!2$+ θ$4!4$+ · · · + i θ - θ$3!3$+ θ$5!5− · · · , which, using the power-series expansions for cosand sin(θ), tells us that exp(iθ) = . os (θ) + i sin(θ)(θ), the formula for the point with argumentθ on the unit circle in the complex plane. In particular, if we takeθ = π, we obtain the famous formula (ei)π = −1 (since. os (π) = −1 and sin(π) = 0).

This formula is so striking that one feels that it ought to hold for a good reason, rather than being a mere fact that one notices after carrying out some formal algebraic manipulations. And indeed there is a good reason. To see it, let us return to the compound-interest idea and define exp(z) to be the limit of (1 + z/n)n as nw here tends to infinity. Let us concentrate just on the casez = iπ: why should(1 + iπ/n)n be close to - 1 when To answer this, let us think geometrically. What is$n$is very large? the effect on a complex number of multiplying it by1$+ iπ/n$?
On the Argand diagram this number is very close to 1 and vertically above it. Because the vertical line through 1 is tangent to the circle, this means that the number is very close indeed to a number that lies on the circle and has argumentof a number on the circle is the length of the circularπ/n (since the argument arc from 1 to that number, and in this case the circular arc is almost straight). Therefore, . ext{multiplication by} 1+iπ/n is very well approximated by rotation through an angle ofπ, which is the same as multiplication byπ/n. Doing this n times results in a rotation by-1.
The same argument can be used to justify the formula exp. os (θ) + i sin(θ). (iθ) = of the exponential function is the exponential function. Continuing in this vein, let us see why the derivative

We know already that exp(z + w) = . xp (z) . xp (w), so the derivative of exp atzero of exp(z)(. xp (w) -z1)/wis the limit as. It is therefore enoughw tends to to show that exp(w) - 1 is very close to w when w is small. To get a good idea of expa large n and consider (1 + w/n)(w)n. It is not hard towe should take prove that this is indeed close to 1 + w, but here is an in formal argument instead. Suppose that you have abank account that offers a tiny rate of interest over a year, say 0 could compound this interest monthly? The answer is.5%. How much better would you do if you not very much:
if the total amount of interest is very small, then the interest on the interest is negligible. This, in essence, is why1 + w when w is small. (1 + w/n)n is approximately function yet further. The main ingredients one needs are addition, multiplication, and the possibility of lim-One can extend the definition of the exponential iting arguments. So, for example, if banach algebra [III.12](/part - 03/c--algebras)A, then expx is an element of a(x) makes sense.
(Here, the power series definition is the easiest, though not necessarily the most enlightening.) 4 The Logarithm Function Natural logarithms, like exponentials, can be defined inmany ways. Here are three. (i) The function log is the inverse of the function exp. That is, ift is a positive real number, then the statement statementt = . xp u (u)= .. og (t) is equivalent to the (ii) Lett be a positive real number. Then. og (t) =1 t dxx .

The function expis an isomorphism from + R to R , and log, its inverse, is an isomorphism from groups have the same structure, and the exponential R + to R.
Thus, in a sense the two+ and logarithmic functions demonstrate this. III. Mathematical Concepts must equal log. xp Let us use the first definition of log to see why log(b). Then log(s)(s)+=. og a}(t), log. Write(t) = bs, and= . xp (a) and (st)t =. og (st) = . og (. xp (a) . xp (b))= . og (. xp (a + b))= a + b. The result follows. In general, the properties of log closely follow those of exp. However, there is one very important differ - ence, which is a complication that arises when one tries to extend log to the complex numbers. At first it seems quite easy:
every complex number written asr (ei)θ for some nonnegative real num berz can ber and sometively). Ifzθ=(the modulus and argument ofr (ei)θ then log(z), one might think, shouldz, respec- be log(r ) + iθ (using the functional equation for log and the fact that log inverts exp). The problem with this is thatθ is not uniquely determined. For instance, what is logwe could, perversely, say that 1(1)? Normally we would like to say 0, but= e2πi and claim that . og (1) = 2πi.

One con-vention is to writez = r eiθ with r > 0 and 0 ⩽ θ < 2π, which can be done in exactly one way, and. og (z) to be log(r ) + iθ. However, this function is not then define continuous: as you cross the positive real axis, the argument jumps by 2π and the logarithm jumps by$2$πRemarkably, this difficulty, far from being a blowi.
to mathematics, is an entirely positive phenomenon that lies behind several remarkable theorems in complex analysis, such as Cauchy’s residue theorem, which allows one to evaluate very general path integrals. III.26 The Fast Fourier Transform If$f$: R\to  R is a periodic function with period 1, then one can obtain a great deal of useful information about$f$by calculating its Fourier coefficients (see the fourier transform This is true for both theoretical and practical reasons,[III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) for a discussion of why).
and because of the latter it is highly desirable to havea good way of computing Fourier coefficients quickly. A method for doing this was discovered by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 (though it turned out that Gauss had anticipated them over 150 years earlier).

So we can regard both belonging to the group Z of integers mod Nn(see and mod-r as ular arithmetic to one that reflects this. Given a function[III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic)).

The fast Fouriern).
Therefore it can be calculated using transform arises from the observation that the sum in (1) has symmetry properties that allow it to be calcu-lated much more efficiently. This is most easily seen when shall look at the case N is a power of 2, and to make it even easier we N = 8. The sums to be evaluated are then g(0) + ω-r g(1) + ω-2 r g(2) + · · · + ω-7 rg(7) for eachr between 0 and 7.
Now a sum like this can be rewritten as g(0) + ω-2 rg(2) + ω-4 r g(4) + ω-6 rg(6)+ ω-r (g(1) + ω-2 rg(3) + ω-4 r g(5) + ω-6 r g(7)), 203 which is interesting because g(0) + ω-2 r g(2) + ω-4 r g(4) + ω-6 r g(6) and g(1) + ω-2 r g(3) + ω-4 r g(5) + ω-6 r g(7) are themselves values of discrete Fourier transforms. For instance, if we set h(n) = g(2 n) for 0 ⩽ n ⩽ 3, and write equal sh(0ψ) +forψ-(ωr)2 h(=1)e2 + {}π(ψi()/){4}-, then the first expression2 r h(2) + (ψ-3)rh(3).
If we think ofthe formula for ˆhas being defined onh(r )$. Z^{4}$, then this is precisely A similar remark applies to the second expression, so if we can calculate the discrete Fourier transforms of the “even part” of$g$and the “odd part” ofg, then it will be very straightforward to obtain each value of the Fourier transform ofg itself: it will be a linear combination of values of the transforms of the two parts ofg. Thus, if N is even and we write F(N) for the number of operations needed to calculate the discrete fourier transform of a function defined on Z , we obtain a

$N$

recurrence of the form

$F(N) = 2F(N/2) + CN$.

The interpretation of this is that in order to work outthe N values of the transform of a function on Z , it is enough to work out two such transforms for functionson Z and work out N linear combinations, each of N which takes a constant number of steps. If NN/is a power of 2, then we can iterate this:2 F(N/2) will be at most 2 F(N/4) + CN/2, and so on. It is not hard to show as a result that for some constant C, a considerable improvement on F(N) is at most CN . og NCN}2.
If N is not a power of 2, then the above argu- ment does not work, but there are modifications ofthe method that do, and that lead to similar efficiency gains. (Indeed, this is true for the Fourier transform on an arbitrary finite Abelian group.)Once we can calculate Fourier transforms efficiently, there are other calculations that immediately become easy as well. A simple example is the inverse Fourier transform, which has a formula very similar to that of the Fourier transform and can therefore be calcu-lated in a similar way. Another calculation that becomes easy is the defined as follows.

We have a group of two transformations of the What are the symmetry properties enjoyed by even real line: one is the identity mapι:$x \to x \text{and the}$ other is the reflectionρ: x → −x. Now any trans for- mationtion of the functions defined on the real line: given aφ of the real line gives rise to a transforma- functiong(x) = f (φ(x))f , the transformed function is the function.

Very broadly speaking, a fourier transform is a systematic way to decompose “generic” functions into a superposition of “symmetric” func-tions.
These symmetric functions are usually quite explicitly defined: for instance, one of the most important examples is a decomposition into the metric functions [III.92](/part-03/trigonometric-functions) sin(nx) and cos(nx)trigono-. They are also often related to physical concepts such as fre-quency or energy. The symmetry will usually be associated with a group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)G, which is usually Abe- lian.
(In the case considered above, it is the two-element group.) Indeed, the Fourier transform is a fundamental tool in the study of groups, and more precisely in the representation theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) of groups, which concerns different ways in which a group can be regarded as a group of symmetries.
It is also related to topics in linear algebra, such as the representation of a vector as linear combinations of anor as linear combinations of orthonormal basis eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), a matrix or linear operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties). integer posing functions from For a more complicated example, let us fix a positive$n$and let us define a systematic way of decom-C to C, that is, complex-valued functions defined on the complex plane.

The group Z to the set of all these functions under Z is known as the Pontryagin dual of T. related areas of harmonic analysis, the most important Fourier transform is defined on the Euclidean space In the theory of partial differential equations and in Rd .

More precisely, we have the formulas1 f (x) =R d f (ξ) e2πi x · ξ dξ, fer ent ly, with factors such as 2 places. These notational differences have some minor benefits and1.

To be explicit about it,. elta f (x) = . elt(a R)d f (ξ) e2πi x · ξ dξ=R d f (ξ)ˆ. elta(e2()π){i}x · ξ dξ= {}Rd(-4π2|ξ|2)f (ξ)ˆ e2(πi()x){·}ξ dξ,

which gives us a formula for the Laplacian of a gen-eral function. Here we have interchanged the Laplacian Δwith an integral; this can be rigorously justified for suitably nice This formula representsf , but we omit the details.Δf as a superposition of plane waves. But any such representation is unique, and the Fourier in version formula tells us that

. elta f (x) = {}Rd . elta f (ξ)(e2()π){i}x · ξ dξ.

Therefore,

$\Delta f (ξ) = (-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2})f (ξ)$,ˆ

a fact that can also be derived directly from the definition of the Fourier transform using integration by parts. This identity shows that the Fourier transform diagonalizes Laplacian, when viewed using the Fourier transform, isthe Laplacian: the operation of taking the nothing more than multiplication of a function the multiplier$-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2}$. The quantity -4π2|ξ|2 F(ξ)can beby interpreted as the energy level associated4 with the frequencyas a Fourier multiplierξ.
In other words, the Laplacian can be viewed, meaning that to calculate the Laplacian you take the Fourier transform, multiply bythe multiplier, and then take the inverse Fourier transform again. This viewpoint allows one to manipulate the Laplacian very easily. For instance, we can iterate the above formula to compute higher powers of the Laplacian: . elta nf (ξ) = (-4π2|ξ|2)nf (ξ)ˆ for$n = 0$, 1, 2, . . . . Indeed, we are now in a position to develop more gen-eral functions of the Laplacian. For instance, we can take a square root as follows:
$-\Delta f (ξ) = 2π|ξ|f (ξ)$.ˆ This leads to the theory of fractional differential oper-ators (which are in turn a special case of pseudo differential operators), as well as the more general theory to make the energies positive.4. When taking this view, it is customary to replaceΔ by -Δ in order

III.27. The Fourier Transform

of starts with a given operator (such as the Laplacian) and functional calculus [IV.15 §3.1](/part-04/operator-algebras), in which one then studies various functions of that operator, suchas square roots, exponentials, inverses, and so forth. As the above discussion shows, the Fourier transform can be used to develop a number of interesting oper-ations, which have particular importance in the theory of differential equations. To analyze these operations effectively, one needs various estimates on the Fourier transform.
For instance, it is often important to know how the size of a functionf , as measured by some norm, relates to the size of its Fourier transform, asmeasured by a possibly different norm. For a further discussion of this point, see function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces).
One particularly important and striking estimate of this type is the Plancherel identity, which shows that the actually equal Rd to the|f (x)|L2 L2 d-norm of a Fourier transform is-norm of the original function.x =R d |f (ξ)ˆ|2 dξ, The Fourier transform is therefore a unitary operation, so one can view the frequency-space representation of2 a function as being in some sense a “rotation” of the physical-space representation. transform and associated operators is a major compo-nent of harmonic analysis.
A variant of the Plancherel Developing further estimates related to the Fourier identity is the convolution formula: This formula allows one to analyze the R d f (y)g(x - y) dy =R d f (ξ)ˆg(ξ) convolutione2πi x^·^ξ dξ.f^* g(x) =R d f (y)g(x - y) dy

of two functions forms; in particular, if the Fourier coefficients off and g in terms of their Fourier trans-f org are small, then we expect the convolution f* g to be small as well. This relationship means that the fourier transform controls certain correlations of a function with itself and with other functions, which makes the Fourier transform an important tool in understanding the randomness and uniform distribution proper-ties of various objects in probability theory, harmonic analysis, and number theory.
For instance, one can pur-sue the above ideas to establish the central limit theorem, which asserts that the sum of many independent random variables will eventually resemble a gaussian distribution ods to establish[III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions); one can even use such meth-vinogradov’s theorem [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859), that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes. 207 above set of ideas.
For instance, one can replace the Laplacian by a more general operator and the plane There are many directions in which to generalize the waves by (generalized) eigenfunctions of that operator. This leads to the subject ofand functional calculus; one can also study the alge-spectral theory [III.86](/part - 03/the - spectrum) bra of Fourier multipliers (and of convolution) more abstractly, which leads to the theory of$C*$[IV.15 §3](/part - 04/operator - algebras). One can also go beyond the theory of lin-ear operators and study bilinear, multilinear, or even-algebras fully nonlinear operators.
This leads in particular tothe theory of paraproducts, which are generalizations of the pointwise product operation(f (x), g(x)) . of g(x)In another direction, one can replace Euclidean space that are of importance in differential equations. Rd by a more general group, in which case the notion of a plane wave is replaced by the notion of aacter (if the group is Abelian) or a representation char-(if the group is non - Abelian).
There are other variants ofthe Fourier transform, such as the Laplace transform or the Mellin transform (for more about other trans - forms, see the article transforms [III.91](/part - 03/transforms)), which are very similar algebraically to the Fourier transform and play similar roles (for instance, the Laplace transform isalso useful in analyzing differential equations). We have already seen that Fourier transforms are connected to Taylor series;
there is also a connection to some other important series expansions, notably Dirichlet series, as well as expansions of functions in terms of polynomials [III.85](/part - 03/special - functions) such as orthogonal polynomials special or The Fourier transform decomposes a function ex-spherical harmonics [III.87](/part - 03/spherical - harmonics). actly into many components, each of which has a precise frequency.
In some applications it is more useful to adopt a “fuzzier” approach, in which a function is decomposed into fewer components but each compo-nent has a range of frequencies rather than consisting purely of a single frequency. Such decompositions can have the advantage of being less constrained by the uncertainty principle, which asserts that it is impossible for both a function and its Fourier transform to be concentrated in very small regions of Rd.
This leads to some variants of the Fourier transform, such as wavelet transforms to a number of problems in applied and computational[VII.3](/part - 07/wavelets - and - applications), which are better suited mathematics, and also to certain questions in harmonic analysis and differential equations. The uncertainty principle, being fundamental to quantum mechanics, also connects the Fourier transform to mathematical physics, and in particular to the connections between

classical and quantum physics, which can be studied rigorously using the methods of geometric quantization and microlocal analysis. III.28 Fuchsian Groups

One of the most basic objects in geometry is thea surface that has the shape of the surface of a bagel.torus: If you want to construct one, you can do so by tak-ing a square and gluing opposite edges together. When you glue the top and bottom edges together you havea cylinder, and when you glue the other two edges together, which have now become circles, you obtain your torus. A more mathematical way of making a torus is as follows.
We start with the usual and the square in it with vertices at(x, y)(0 coordinate plane, 0), (1, 0), (1,1), an dates satisfy 0(0, 1), which consists of the points whose coordin-⩽ x ⩽ 1, 0 ⩽ y ⩽ 1. This square can be moved around horizontally and vertically. If we shift itm units horizontally and n units vertically, where m andthe points whose coordinates sat is fyn are integers, we get the square that consists ofm ⩽ x ⩽ m + 1, n ⩽ y ⩽ n+1.
As m and n run through all the integers, we see that the copies of the square cover the whole plane, with four squares coming together at each point with integer coordinates. The plane is said to beor tessellated (from the Latin word for a marble chip in tiled a mosaic), and it is easy to see that you can color the squares alternately black and white and get an infinite checkerboard pattern. To make the torus we “identify” points. We say that the points point in a certain new figure if(x, y) and (x^ , y^ ) correspond to the samex - x^  and y - y^  are both integers.
To see what the new figure looks like, we observe that any point in the plane corresponds to a point inside, or on the edge of, our original square. More over, the point(x, y) corresponds to exactly one point inside the square provided that neither is an integer. So our new space looks a lot like our origi-x nor y nal square. But what about the points They correspond to the same point in our new space, as(1 4,0) and (1 4, 1)? do any corresponding pairs of points on the upper and lower edges of our square. So those edges are identified in our new space.
By a similar argument, so too are the left and right edges. The result is that, after points are identified according to our rule, we obtain the torus. figures on it just by drawing them in the original square; If we make the torus in this way, we can draw small III. Mathematical Concepts lengths in the square will then correspond exactly to lengths on the torus. This is how old-fashioned printing on a drum works: an inked figure on a cylinder is rolled over the paper to make exact copies of the figure.
Thus, as far as small figures are concerned, the geom-etry of the torus is exactly like Euclidean geometry. In mathematical language we say that the geometry on the torus is induced from the geometry on the plane, and therefore that it isit is different, because one can draw curves on the torus locally Euclidean. Globally, of course, that cannot be shrunk to a point, where as one cannot do so on the plane. the bulk of the work for us.
In this case the group is Notice, too, that we have brought in a group to do the set of all pairs with(m, n) + (m^ , n(m, n)^ )defined to be wherem and(mn+are integers, m^ , n + n^ ). class of surfaces that are closed (they have no bound-The torus and the sphere are but two of an infinite ary) and compact (they do not in any sense go off toinfinity). Other examples include the two-holed torus, and more generally the genus 2, 3, 4, . . . ). To create these in a similar way, wen-holed torus (the surfaces of need Fuchsian groups.
It is natural to expect that we can get other surfaces by using polygons with more than four sides. It turns out that if you use a polygon with eight sides, for example a regular octagon, and glue sides 1 and 3 together, 2 and 4 together, 5 and 7 together, and 6 and 8 together, you get the two-holed torus. How can we usea group to achieve the same result, as we did with the torus? For that we need a way of fitting lots of copies of the octagon together so that they overlap only along edges. The problem is that one cannot tile the plane with octagons:
the angles of an octagon are 135◦, and that is far too big because we need eight octagons to fit together at each vertex. The way forward here is to use hyperbolic geometry can also work with our bare hands. Take the unit disk[I.3 §6.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) instead of Euclidean geometry. But we in the complex plane, D$= {z}$:$|z| ⩽ 1$. Take the group of what are called are maps of the form$z$Möbius transformations$\to (az + b)/(cz + d)$.
It is a, which routine calculation to show that these maps send circles and straight lines to circles and straight lines (they mix the two types up, some times sending a circle to a straight line and vice versa) and that they map angles to equal angles, just like the more familiar Euclidean rotations. If we now select just those Möbius trans for-ma tions that map D to itself, then we have a group that

III.28. Fuchsian Groups

we shall call group. G. Indeed, we very nearly have a Fuchsian the square played in the Euclidean plane. Our group$G$We need to find a shape that will play the role that has the property that it maps diameters of D and arcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary ofdiameters of D and arcs of circles perpendicular to D to the boundary of D, so we let these play the role of straight lines and use eight of them as the edges ofa (non-Euclidean) octagon. We find that we can do this in many ways, so we pick one with the highest degree of symmetry to make things easy for ourselves.
That is, we draw a “regular octagon” centered on the center of the disk D. This still leaves us with some choice: the bigger the octagon, the smaller its angles. So we draw the octagon with angles ofπ/4, which allows eight of them to cluster at each vertex, and then we can fit them together as we want.
If we identify points that lie in corresponding places in different copies of the polygon, then the resulting space is a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) of genus 2.A Fuchsian group is a subgroup of the group$G$ (of Möbius transformations that map D to itself) that moves some polygon around “en bloc” and there by tiles the disk.
Just as with the torus, we have a notion of equivalent points (ones that are in the corresponding place in different tiles) and when we identify equivalent points we get the space that we would also have obtained by identifying the edges of the polygon in pairs, which is the space we wanted. All this can be described in the language of hyperbolic geometry. Thea riemannian metric disk model[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) onis defined by means of D, the differential of which is given by d$s = 1|− |dz|z|^{2}$.
The elements of Gmove figures around in D in a way that preserves hyperbolic distances. It follows that the geometry on the surface that we obtain by identifying points in the manner just described is locally hyperbolic It turns out that if we carry out the above con struc-, just as that of the torus was locally Euclidean. tion starting with a regular 4 then we obtain a Riemann surface of genus$n$-sided figure (with$n$. But math - n > 2), ematicians can do much more.
If you go back to the plane and start not with a square but with a rectangle, or still more generally a parallelogram, it is rea-son ably easy to see that the same construction can be carried out. Indeed, if you just watch the original con-struc tion from an appropriate angle, instead of from

209

vertically above the plane, then the square will turn into any parallelogram you choose (possibly enlarged or contracted). When you use a parallelogram, you again obtain a torus, but it differs from the original one in the same way that the square and the parallelogram differ: angles are distorted. It is a not entirely trivial exerciseto show that the only angle-preserving maps from one parallelogram to another are similarities (uniform scaling by the same amount in two, and therefore all, direc-tions). So the resulting tori have a different sense of what angles are:
that is, they have different structures. conformal The same happens in the hyperbolic disk. If one picks a 4 whose edges come in pairs of equal length, and onen-sided polygon (its sides are parts of geodesics) finds a group that moves this polygon around en bloc and matches the edges exactly, then a Riemann surface is once again obtained, but if the polygons are not conformally equivalent, then neither are the cor-responding surfaces; they have the same genus, n, but different conformal structures.
We can even go further and allow some of the vertices of the polygon to lie on the boundary of the disk, in which case the corresponding sides of the polygon are infinitely long with respect to the hyperbolic metric. The space we then construct is a “punctured” Riemann surface, and again mathematicians can vary its conformal structure.
The fundamental importance of Fuchsian groups derives from the that all but the simplest Riemann surfaces arise from uniformization theorem, which says some Fuchsian group in the fashion described above. This includes every Riemann surface of genus greater than 1, and those of genus 1 with at least one puncture, with any possible conformal structure.
The name Fuchsian group was given to these groups bythe course of work on the hypergeometric equation andpoincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in 1881, who discovered them in related differential equations, which had been inspired
by the work of the German mathematician Lazarus Fuchs. klein [VI.57] protested to him that a better procedure might have been to name them after Schwarz, and Poincaré was willing to agree once he read the relevant paper by Schwarz, but by then Fuchs had given his approval to the name. When Klein protested too much(in Poincaré’s view), Poincaré publicly gave the name Kleinian groups arise in the study of conformal transformations of theto the analogous class of groups that three-dimensional unit ball.
The names have stuck ever since, but the study of Kleinian groups is much more difficult and neither Poincaré nor Klein could do much 210 with the concept. However, the idea that every riemann surface might arise from either the sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane was something they both came to conjecture. Rigorous proofs of this statement, the uniformization theorem, were to be given only in 1907, by Poincaré and Koebe independently. lows.

1 What Is a Function Space?

When one works with real or complex numbers, there is a natural notion of the magnitude of a numberx, namely its modulus of magnitude to define a distance|x|. One can also use this notion|x - y| between two numbers which pairs of numbers are close and which ones arex and y and there by say in a quantitative way far apart. when one deals with objects with more degrees of freedom. Consider for instance the problem of deter-The situation becomes more complicated, however, mining the “magnitude” of a three-dimensional rect-angular box. There are several candidates for such a magnitude:
length, width, height, volume, surface area, diameter (the length of a long diagonal), eccentricity, and so forth. Unfortunately, these magnitudes donot give equivalent comparisons: for example, box A may be longer and have a greater volume than box B, but box B may be wider and have a greater surface area. Because of this, one abandons the idea that there should be only one notion of “magnitude” for boxes, and instead accepts that there is a multiplicity of such notions and that they can all be useful:
for some appli-ca tions one may wish to distinguish the large-volume boxes from the small-volume boxes, while in others onemay wish to distinguish the eccentric boxes from the round boxes. Of course, there are several relationships between the different notions of magnitude (e.g., the isoperimetric inequality an upper limit on the possible volume if one knows the[IV.26] allows one to place surface area), so the situation is not as disorganized asit may at first appear.

and range. (A good case to have in mind is functions$f$ Now let us turn to functions with a fixed domain:[-1,1] \to  R from the interval [-1, 1] to the real line R.) These objects have infinitely many degrees of freedom, so it should not be surprising that there are now infinitely many distinct notions of “magnitude,” which all provide different answers to the question “how large is a given function tion “how close together are two functions$f$?” (or to the closely related ques-f and g?”).
In some cases, certain functions may have infinite mag-nitude by one measure and finite magnitude by another (similarly, a pair of functions may be very close by one measure and very far apart by another). Again, this situation may seem chaotic, but it simply reflects the fact that functions have many distinct characteristics— some are tall, some are broad, some are smooth, some are oscillatory, and so forth—and that, depending on the application at hand, one may need to give more weight to one of these characteristics than to others.
In analysis, these characteristics are embodied in a vari-ety of standard function spaces and their associated norms qualitatively and quantitatively., which are available to describe functions both Xdomain and range).

For simplicity we shall consider only spaces of functions from[-1,1] to R. considered to be.1. The more smoothly a function varies, the more “regular” it is III.29. Function Spaces 2.1 C0[-1, 1] This space consists of all[I.3 §5.2](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions) from[-1,1] to R, and is some times denoted continuous functions C[-1,1].
Continuous functions are regular enough to allow one to avoid many of the technical subtleties associated with very rough functions. Continuous func-tions on a compact [III.9](/part - 03/compactness - and-\text{compactication}) interval such as[-1, 1] are bounded, so the most natural norm to place on this space is theis the largest possible value ofsupremum norm, denoted|f (x)|. (Formally, it isf . nfty , which defined to be sup tinuous functions on\\{|f (x)[-|1},\\: 1 x] . nthe two definitions are[-1, 1], but for con - equivalent.) form convergence:

The space C0[-1 n,1] has the useful prop-. nfty adding them. This makes it a basic example of a algebra. Banach 2.2 C1[-1, 1] This is a space that has a more restricted member-ship than C0[-1, 1]: not only must a functionf in C1[-1, 1] be continuous but it must also have a deriva- tive that is continuous.
The supremum norm here isno longer a natural one, because a sequence of continuously differentiable functions can converge in this norm to a non differentiable function. Instead, the right norm here is theto be$f + f C1-$.norm (f C()1()[){ - 1}\\\{,\\\}1 ], which is defined a function tr oll ing the latter would be unsatisfactory, since it Notice that the. nfty and the size of its derivative. (Merely con-. nfty C1-norm measures both the size of would give constant functions a norm of zero.) Thusit is a norm that forces a greater degree of regularity than the supremum norm.
One can similarly define the space$C^{2}[-1$,1]of twice continuously differentiable functions, and so forth, all the way up to the space$C \infty [-1$,1]of infinitely differentiable functions. (There are also “fractional” versions of these spaces, such as(C0)\\\{}},\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}α[-1, 1], the space of α}}-Hölder continuous functions. We will not discuss these variants here.)

2.3 The Lebesgue Spaces Lp[-1, 1]

The supremum norm simultaneous control on the size off . nfty  mentioned earlier gives|f (x)| for all x \in[-1, 1]. However, this means that if there is a tiny set

211

of large, even if a typical value ofx for which |f (x)| is very large, then|f (x)| is much smaller.f . nfty  is very It is some times more advantageous to work with norms that are less influenced by the values of a function on small sets. The Lp-norm. um  of a function f isfp =-1 1 |f (x)|p d(x1)/p.

This is defined for 1 The function space L⩽p[p <-1,. nfty 1]and for any measurable is the class of measurablef . functions for which the above norm is finite. The normf . nfty  of a measurable function f is its essential supre-$mum$|f (x): roughly speaking this means the largest value of| if you ignore sets of measure zero. It turns out to be the limit of the norm sity. The space L. nfty [-1, 1] consists of those me a sur a bl efp as ptends to infin functionsf for which f . nftyis finite.
While the$L \infty\text{norm}$ is concerned solely with the “height” of a function, the Lp norms are instead concerned with a combination of the “height” and “width” of a function. LThis space is exceptionally rich in symmetries: there2 Particularly important among these norms is the-norm, since L2[-1, 1] is a hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). is a wide variety of invertible linear maps unitary transformations Tdefined on L2[-1, 1] such that, that is, T f2 = f2 for every function f \in L2[-1, 1].$2$.4 The Sobolev Spaces Wk, p[-1, 1]

The Lebesgue norms control, to some extent, the height and width of a function, but say nothing about regularity; there is no reason why a function in Lp should be differentiable or even continuous. To incorporate such information one often turns to the Sobolev norms (f W)k, (p[)-1,1], defined for 1$⩽ p ⩽ \infty\text{and} k ⩾ 0 by(f W)k$, p[ - 1^,1] = j = k 0 ddjx(fj)p. The Sobolev space Wk, p[-1,1] is the space of functions for which this norm is finite. Thus, a function lies in Wk, p[-1, 1]if it and its firstk derivatives all belong to Lp[-1, 1]. There is one subtlety:
we do not requiref to be weaker sense ofktimes differentiable in the usual sense, but in the distributions [III.18](/part - 03/distributions). For instance, the function$f$ (x) = |x|is not differentiable at zero, but it does have a natural weak derivative: the functionf^ (x) which is -1 when x < 0 and +1 when x > 0. This function lies in L. nfty [-1,1] (since the set {0} has measure zero, we do not need to specify therefore f lies in (W1),. nfty [-1,1] (which turns out to bef^ (0)), and the space of Lipschitz-continuous functions). We need

212

to consider these generalized differentiable functions because with out them the space Wk, p[-1,1] would not be complete. Sobolev norms are particularly natural and useful in the analytical study of partial differential equations and mathematical physics. For instance, the W1\\\{}},\\2 norm can be interpreted as (the square root of) an “energy”associated with a function. 3 Properties of Function Spaces There are many ways in which knowledge of the struc-ture of function spaces can assist in the study of functions.
For instance, if one has a good basis for the function space, so that every function in the space isa (possibly infinite) linear combination of basis elements, and one has some quantitative estimates onhow this linear combination converges to the original function, then this allows one to represent that function efficiently in terms of a number of coefficients, and also allows one to approximate that func-tion by smoother functions.
For instance, one basic result about L2[-1, 1] is the Plancherel theorem, which asserts, among other things, that there are numbers(a ). nfty such thatnn=−. nftyf - n=−N N aneπi nx2 \to 0 as N → . nfty.

This shows that any function in approximated to any desired accuracy in L2[-1, 1]L2 can beby a trigonometric polynomial form N a eπi nx. The number: that is, an expression of thea is the nth Fourier coefficient n=−f (n)Nˆn of f . It is given by the formula nf (n)ˆ= 12-1 1 f (x)(e-)πi nx dx. tions eare in fact an One can regard this result as saying that the func-πi nx form a very good basis for orthonormal basis: they have norm 1 and L2[-1, 1].
(They the inner product of two different ones is always zero.)Another very basic fact about function spaces is that certain function spaces embed into others, sothat a function from one space automatically also belongs to other spaces. Further more, there is often some inequality that gives an upper bound for one norm in terms of another.
For instance, a function in ahigh-regularity space such as$C1[-1$,1] automatically belongs to a low-regularity space such as$C0[-1$,1], and a function in a high-integrability space such as L. nfty [-1, 1] automatically belongs to a low-integrability space such as L1[-1,1]. (This statement is no longer

III. Mathematical Concepts

These inclusions1]by a set of inficannot be reversed; however, one does have the Sobolev embedding theorem la ri ty for integrability. This result tells us that spaces, which allows one to “trade” reguwith lots of regularity but low integrability can beembedded into spaces with low regularity but high integrability. A sample estimate of this type is

which tells us that if the integrals of|f (x)| and |f (x)| are both finite, then far stronger integrability condition than the finitenessf must be bounded (which is a of Another very useful concept is that of$f1)$. duality [III.19](/part - 03/duality). Given a function space dual space$X^{*}$, which is formally defined as the class$X$, one can define the of all cise ly all maps continuous linear functionalsω:$X \to R (or ω$: X \to on CX, if the function, or more pre- space is complex valued) that are linear and continuous with respect to the norm of X .
For example, it turns out that every linear functionalω on the space Lp [-1, 1] is of the form

$ω(f ) = {}^{-11} f (x)g(x) dx$

for some functiong in Lq[-1,1], where q is the dual$or1$/pconjugate exponent+ 1/q = 1. of p, defined by the equation One can some times analyze functions in a function space by looking instead at how the linear function-als in the dual space act on those functions. Similarly, one can often analyze a continuous linear operator$T$: X \to  Y from one function space to another by first considering the adjoint operator$T^{*}$:$Y^{*} \to X^{*}$, defined for all linear functionals T*ω be the functional on Xdefined by the formulaω:$Y \to R \text{by letting} T^{*}ω(x) = ω(T x)$.

We mention one more important fact about function spaces, which is that certain function spaces“interpolate” between two other function spaces$X^{0} \text{and XXspaces}^{1}$. For example, there is a natural sense in which the Lp[-1, 1] with 1 < p < . nfty“lie between” the spaces L1[-1, 1] and L. nfty [-1,1]. The precise definition of interpolation is too technical for this article, but its usefulness lies in the fact that the “extreme” spaces$X0$ andmediate” spaces$X^{1}$are often easier to deal with than the “inter-X.
For this reason, it is some times possible to prove difficult results about much easier results about$X^{0} and X^{1}$and “interpolat-X by proving ing” between them. For instance, it can be used to give

a short proof ofing statement. Let 1 Young’s inequality⩽ p, q, r ⩽ . nfty  , which is the follow-satisfy the equation 1$L/pq(R+)$, respectively, and let1/q = 1/r + 1, let f fand^*ggbe the be long to convolution Lp(R)ofandf$and$. um  g: that is,$f^{*} g(x) = {}^{−}$. nfty$\infty f (y)g(x - y) dy$.

Interpolation is useful here because the inequality iseasy to prove in the extreme cases when$p = 1$, whenq = 1, or when r = $\infty$.
It is much harder to prove this result with out the help of interpolation theory. III.30 Galois Groups Given a polynomial function cients, the splitting field of$f$is defined to be the small-$f$with rational co ef fie stand all the roots of field [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) that contains all rational num be rsf . The Galois group of f is the group of all field.
Each such automorphism permutes the roots of automorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of the splittingf , so the Galois group can be thought of as a subset of the group of all structure and properties of the Galois group are closely permutations [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) of these roots. The connected with the solubility of the polynomial: in par-ticular, the Galois group can be used to show that not all polynomials are means of a formula that involves the usual arithmetic solvable by radicals (that is, solvable by operations together with the extraction of roots).
This theorem, spectacular as it is, is by no means the only application of Galois groups: they play a central role in modern algebraic number theory. For more details, see the insolubility of the quintic [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) and algebraic numbers [IV.1 §20](/part-04/number-theory). III.31 The Gamma Function

Actually, for various rea-sons it is natural to define$Γ \text{so that} Γ (n) = (n - 1)$! for n = 2, 3, . . . . Let us start by writing. nftyΓ (s) =0 (xs)-1 e-x dx, (1)

Therefore, for such s, we can ignore the first term in the above expression.
But the second one is simply the formula for$Γ (s - 1)$, so we have shown that$Γ (s) = (s - 1)Γ (s - 1)$, which is just what we need if we want to think oflike$(s - 1)$!.Γ (s) as something It is not hard to show that the integral is in fact convergent whenever real part of$s$) is positive.
