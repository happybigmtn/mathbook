in 1976 Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken settled afamous old problem by proving the four-color theorem huge number of different map configurations, which[V.12](/part-05/the-four-color-theorem). Their proof involved the checking of a they did with the help of a computer. Initially, this raised debates about the legitimacy of their proof but it quickly became accepted and there are now several proofs of this kind. Some mathematicians even believe that computer-assisted and, more importantly, computer-generated discipline. Under this (currently minority) view, ourproofs are the future of the entire present views about what counts as an acceptable mathematical proof will soon become obsolete. ematics now contain conjectures that seem to be both fundamentally important and out of reach for the fore-A last point to stress is that many branches of math see able future. Mathematicians persuaded of the truthof such conjectures increasingly undertake the systematic study of their consequences, assuming that an acceptable proof will one day appear (or at least that the conjecture is true). Such conditional results are pub-lished in leading mathematical journals and doctoral degrees are routinely awarded for them.These trends all raise interesting questions about existing conceptions of legitimate mathematical proofs, the status of truth in mathematics, and the relationship between “pure” and “applied” fields. The formal notionof a proof as a string of symbols that obeys certain syntactical rules continues to provide an ideal modelfor the principles that underlie what most mathematicians see as the essence of their discipline. It allowsfar-reaching mathematical analysis of the power of certain axiomatic systems, but at the same time it falls short of explaining the changing ways in which mathematicians decide what kinds of arguments they are will-ing to accept as legitimate in their actual professional practice.

Mathematics

José Ferreirós

The foundational crisis is a celebrated affair among mathematicians and it has also reached a large nonmathematical audience. A well-trained mathematician is supposed to know something about the three viewpoints called “logicism,” “formalism,” and “intuition-ism” (to be explained below), and about what gödel’s incompleteness resultsof mathematical knowledge. Professional mathemati-[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem) tell us about the status cians tend to be rather opinionated about such top-ics, either dismissing the foundational discussion as irrelevant—and thus siding with the winning party—or defending, either as a matter of principle or as an intriguing option, some form of revisionist approachto mathematics. But the real outlines of the historical debate are not well-known and the subtler philo-sophical issues at stake are often ignored. Here we shall mainly discuss the former, in the hope that thiswill help bring the main conceptual issues into sharper focus.The foundational crisis is usually understood as a relatively localized event in the 1920 s, a heated debate between the partisans of “classical” (meaning late-nineteenth-century) mathematics, led byand their critics, led by brouwer [VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966), who advo-hilbert [VI.63](/part-06/david-hilbert-18621943), cated strong revision of the received doctrines. Thereis, however, a second, and in my opinion very important, sense in which the “crisis” was a long and global process, in distinguishable from the rise of modern mathematics and the philosophical and methodologi-cal issues it created. This is the standpoint from which the present account has been written.Within this longer process one can still pick out some noteworthy intervals. Around 1870 there were many discussions about the acceptability of non-Euclidean geometries, and also about the proper foundations ofcomplex analysis and even the real numbers. Early in the twentieth century there were debates about settheory, about the concept of the continuum, and about the role of logic and the axiomatic method versus

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics the role of intuition. By about 1925 there was a cri-sis in the proper sense, during which the main opinions in these debates were developed and turned into detailed mathematical research projects. And in the 1930 s gödel [VI.92](/part-06/kurt-gdel-19061978) proved his incompleteness results, which could not be assimilated without some cherished beliefs being abandoned. Let us analyze some of these events and issues in greater detail. 1 Early Foundational Questions There is evidence that in 1899 Hilbert endorsed the viewpoint that came to be known as logicism. Logicism was the thesis that the basic concepts of mathemat-ics are definable by means of logical notions, and that the key principles of mathematics are deducible from logical principles alone.Over time this thesis has become unclear, based as it seems to be on a fuzzy and immature conception of thescope of logical theory. But historically speaking logicism was a neat intellectual reaction to the rise of mod-ern mathematics, and particularly to the set-theoretic approach and methods. Since the majority opinion wasthat set theory is just a part of (refined) logic,1 this thesis was thought to be supported by the fact that the theories of natural and real numbers can be derived from set theory, and also by the increasingly important role of set-theoretic methods in algebra and in real and complex analysis. he understood mathematics. For us, the essence of Hilbert’s and Dedekind’s early logicism is their self-Hilbert was following dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) in the way conscious endorsement of certain modern methods, however daring they seemed at the time. These methods had emerged gradually during the nineteenth cen-tury, and were particularly associated with Göttingen mathematics (they experienced a crucial turning point withgauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) and dirichlet [VI.36]); riemannther by Dedekind,’s [VI.49] novel ideas, and were developed fur-cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), Hilbert, and other, lesser figures. Meanwhile, the influential Berlin schoolof mathematics had opposed this new trend, kronecker subtly. (The name of Weierstrass is synonymous with[VI.48](/part-06/leopold-kronecker-18231891) head-on and weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) more the introduction of rigor in real analysis, but in fact, aswill be indicated below, he did not favor the more modern methods elaborated in his time.) Mathematicians in disagreed (see Ferreirós 1999). The “majority” included Dedekind, peano1. One should mention that key figures like Riemann and Cantor[VI.62](/part-06/giuseppe-peano-18581932), Hilbert, russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), and others.

Paris and elsewhere also harbored doubts about thesenew and radical ideas. proach were: The most characteristic traits of the modern ap(i) acceptance of the notion of an “arbitrary” function proposed by Dirichlet; (ii) a wholehearted acceptance of infinite sets and thehigher infinite; (iii) a preference “to put thoughts in the place of calculations” (Dirichlet), and to concentrate on (iv) a frequent reliance on “purely existential” meth-“structures” characterized axiomatically; andods of proof. An early and influential example of these traits was Dedekind’s approach (1871) totheory [IV.1](/part-04/number-theory)—his set-theoretic definition ofalgebraic number number fieldsby which he proved results such as the fundamen-[III.63](/part-03/number-fields) and ideals [III.81 §2](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules), and the methods tal theorem of unique decomposition. In a remark-able departure from the number-theoretic tradition, Dedekind studied the factorization properties of alge-braic integers in terms of ideals, which are certain infinite sets of algebraic integers. Using this new abstract concept, together with a suitable definition of the product of two ideals, Dedekind was able to prove infull generality that, within any ring of algebraic integers, ideals possess a unique decomposition into prime ideals. Dedekind’s proofs do not enable us to calculate, ina particular case, the relevant divisors or ideals: that The influential algebraist Kronecker complained that is, the proof waswas that this abstract way of working, made possible purely existential . Kronecker’s view by the set-theoretic methods and by a concentration on the algebraic properties of the structures involved, was too remote from an algorithmic treatment—that is, from so-called this complaint was misguided: it merely showed that constructive methods. But for Dedekind he had succeeded in elaborating the principle “to put thoughts in the place of calculations,” a principle that was also emphasized in Riemann’s theory of complex functions. Obviously, concrete problems would require the development of more delicate computational tech-niques, and Dedekind contributed to this in several papers. But he also insisted on the importance of ageneral, conceptual theory. became better known through publications of the pe-riod 1867–72.

Exercising his famous critical abilities, Weierstrass offered examples of continuous functions that were nowhere differentiable.It is worth mentioning that, in preferring infinite series as the key means for research in analysis and function theory, Weierstrass remained closer to the old eighteenth-century idea of a function as an ana-lytical expression. On the other hand, Riemann and Dedekind were always in favor of Dirichlet’s abstract idea of a function$f$ as an “arbitrary” way of associating with each$x some y = f (x)$. (Previously it had been required thaty should be expressed in terms ofters, Weierstrass criticized this conception of Dirich-x by means of an explicit formula.)

Hilbert and Kneser would later reformulate and justify the principle.

an “obvious sophism,” promising that he would offer counterexamples. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, which states that an infinite bounded set of real numbers has an accumulation point, was a cornerstone of classical analysis, and was emphasized as such by Weierstrass in his famous Berlin lectures. The problem for Kronecker was that this theorem rests entirely on the completeness axiom for the real numbers (which, in one version, states that every sequence of nonempty nested closed intervals in R has a nonempty intersection). The real numbers cannot be constructed in an elementary way from the rational numbers: one has to make heavy use of infinite sets (such as the set ofall possible “Dedekind cuts,” which are subsets C ⊂ Q such thatbers such thatp \in  Cp < qwhe never and pq and\in  C). To put it anotherq are rational num- way: Kronecker was drawing attention to the problem that, very often, the accumulation point in the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem cannot be constructed by elemen-tary operations from the rational numbers. The classical idea of the set of real numbers, or “the continuum,”already contained the seeds of the nonconstructive ingredient in modern mathematics. ant theory led to a debate about his purely existen-tial proof of another basic result, the Later on, in around 1890, Hilbert’s work on invari-basis theorem, which states (in modern terminology) that every idealin a polynomial ring is finitely generated. Paul Gordan, famous as the “king” of invariants for his heavily algorithmic work on the topic, remarked humorously that this was “theology,” not mathematics! (He appar-ently meant that, because the proof was purely existential, rather than constructive, it was comparable with philosophical proofs of the existence of God.)This early foundational debate led to a gradual clarification of the opposing viewpoints. Cantor’s proofs inset theory also became quintessential examples of the modern methodology of existential proof. He offered an explicit defense of the higher infinite and modern methods in a paper of 1883, which was peppered with hidden attacks on Kronecker’s views. Kronecker in turn criticized Dedekind’s methods publicly in 1882, spoke privately against Cantor, and in 1887 published an attempt to spell out his foundational views. dedekind replied with a detailed set-theoretic (and “thus,” for him, logicistic) theory of the natural numbers in 1888.The early round of criticism ended with an apparent victory for the modern camp, which enrolled new and powerful allies such as Hurwitz, Hilbert, Volterra, Peano, and hadamard minkowski[VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963), and[VI.64](/part-06/hermann-minkowski-18641909),

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics which was defended by influential figures such as[VI.57]. Although Riemannian function theory was still klein in need of further refinement, recent developments in real analysis, number theory, and other fields were showing the power and promise of the modern meth-ods. During the 1890 s, the modern viewpoint in general, and logicism in particular, enjoyed great expan-sion. Hilbert developed the new methodology into the axiomatic method, which he used to good effect in his treatment of geometry (1899 and subsequent editions) and of the real number system. doxes, discovered by Cantor, Russell, Zermelo, and oth-ers, which will be discussed below. These were of two Then, dramatically, came the so-called logical parakinds. On the one hand, there were arguments show-ing that assumptions that certain sets exist lead to contradictions. These were later called the paradoxes. On the other, there were arguments, laterset-theoretic known as the difficulties with the notions of truth and definability.semantic paradoxes, which showed up These paradoxes completely destroyed the attractive view of recent developments in mathematics that had been proposed by logicism. Indeed, the heyday of logi-cism came before the paradoxes, that is, before 1900; it subsequently enjoyed a revival with Russell and his“theory of types,” but by 1920 logicism was of interest more to philosophers than to mathematicians. How-ever, the divide between advocates of the modern methods and constructivist critics of these methods wasthere to stay. 2 Around 1900 Hilbert opened his famous list of mathematical prob-lems at the Paris International Congress of Mathematics of 1900 with Cantor’sa key question in set theory, and with the problem continuum problem [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory), of whether every set can be well-ordered. His second problem amounted to establishing the consistency of the notion of the set R of real numbers. It was not by chance that he began with these problems: rather, itwas a way of making a clear statement about how mathematics should be in the twentieth century. Those two problems, and the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice) employed by Hilbert’s young colleague Zermelo to show that R (the examples of the traits (i)–(iv) that were listed above. Itcontinuum) can be well-ordered, are quintessential is little wonder that less daring minds objected and revived Kronecker’s doubts, as can be seen in many publications of 1905–6. This brings us to the next stageof the debate.

2.1 Paradoxes and Consistency

In a remarkable turn of events, the champions of mod-ern mathematics stumbled upon arguments that cast new doubts on its cogency. In around 1896, Cantor discovered that the seemingly harmless concepts of theset of all ordinals and the set of all cardinals led to contradictions. In the former case the contradiction is usually called thethe Cantor paradox. The assumption that all transfi-Burali-Forti paradox; the latter is nite ordinals form a set leads, by Cantor’s previous results, to the result that there is an ordinal that is lessthan itself—and similarly for cardinals. Upon learning of these paradoxes, Dedekind began to doubt whether human thought is completely rational. Even worse, in 1901–2 Zermelo and Russell discovered a very elemen-tary contradiction, now known as Russell’s paradox or sometimes as the Zermelo–Russell paradox, which will be discussed in a moment. The untenability of the previous understanding of set theory as logic became clear, and there began a new period of instability. But it should be said that only logicists were seriously up set by these arguments: they were presented with contradictions in their theories. Let us explain the importance of the Zermelo–Russell paradox. From Riemann to Hilbert, many authors ac-cepted the principle that, given any well-defined logical or mathematical property, there exists a set of all objects satisfying that property. In symbols: given awell-defined propertyp, there exists another object, the set{x}: p(x). For example, corresponding to the property of “being a real number” (which is expressed formally by Hilbert’s axioms) there is the set of all real numbers; corresponding to the property of “being an ordinal” there is the set of all ordinals; and so on. This is called thethe basis for the logicistic understanding of set theory, comprehension principle, and it constitutes often called naive set theory, although its naivete is only clear with hindsight. The principle was thoughtof as a basic logical law, so that all of set theory was merely a part of elementary logic. The Zermelo–Russell paradox shows that the comprehension principle is contradictory, and it does soby formulating a property that seems to be as basic and purely logical as possible. Letertyx ∉ x (bearing in mind that negation and mem-p(x) be the prop- bership were assumed to be purely logical concepts).The comprehension principle yields the existence of the set$R = {x}$: x ∉ x, but this leads quickly to a contradiction: if$R \in R$, then R ∉ R(\text{by the definition} 146 of R), \text{and similarly}, if R ∉ R, then R \in R.

But in the course of this con-struction, the number$r$has just been defined in finitely many words! Poincaré would ban impredicative definitions and would therefore prevent the introduction ofthe number r, since it was defined with reference to the totality of all definable numbers.3 ematics, all mathematical objects (beyond the natural numbers) must be introduced by explicit definitions.In this kind of approach to the foundations of math If a definition refers to a presumed totality of whichthe object being defined is itself a member, we are involved in a circle: the object itself is then a con-stituent of its own definition. In this view, “definitions” within a well-determined formal theory, whose language and expres-sions are fixed to begin with. Richard’s paradox takes advantage of an3. The modern solution is to establish mathematical definitions ambiguity as to what the available means of definition are.

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics must be predicative: one refers only to totalities thathave already been established before the object one is defining. Important authors such as Russell and weyl [VI.80](/part-06/hermann-weyl-18851955) accepted this point of view and developed it.Zermelo was not convinced, arguing that impredicative definitions were often used unproblematical ly, notonly in set theory (as in Dedekind’s definition of N, for example), but also in classical analysis. As a particular example, he cited cauchy’s [VI.29](/part-06/augustin-louis-cauchy-17891857) proof of the fun[V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra),4 but a simdamental theorem of algebrapler example of impredicative definition is the least upper bound in real analysis. The real numbers arenot introduced separately, by explicit predicative definitions of each one of them; rather, they are introduced as a completed whole, and the particular way in which the least upper bound of an infinite bounded set ofreals is singled out becomes impredicative. But Zermelo insisted that these definitions are innocuous, because the object being defined is not “created” by the definition; it is merely singled out (see his paper of 1908 invan Heijenoort (1967, pp. 183–98)). tions became important for Russell, who incorporated it as the “vicious circle principle” in his influential Poincaré’s idea of abolishing impredicative de fin i theory of types logic, with quantification over properties or sets, over. Type theory is a system of higher-order relations, over sets of sets, and so on. Roughly speaking, it is based on the idea that the elements of anyset should always be objects of a certain homogeneous type. For instance, we can have sets of “individuals,”such as\\{a}, b\\}, or sets of sets of individuals, \text{such as}{{a}}$, \\\\{a, b\\\\}$, but never a “mixed” set like{a}$, \\\\{a, b\\\\}$. Russell’s \text{version of type theory became rather complicated because of the so}-\text{called ramification he adoptedin order to avoid} \text{impredicativity}. \text{This system}, \text{together with axioms of infinity}, choice, and “reducibility” (\text{a surprisingly ad hoc means to} “collapse” \text{the ramification}), \text{sufficed for the development of set theory and the number systems}. \text{Thus it became the logical basis forthe renowned Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell} (1910–13), \text{in which they carefully developed afoundation for mathematics}. about 1930, \text{but under the form of Type theory remained the main logical system until simple type theory tential}” \text{as we have been saying}. \text{In order to show that the polynomial must have one root}, \text{Cauchy studied the absolute value of the polyno} - 4.

Brouwer held that our customary logical principles were abstracted from the way we dealt with subsets of a finite set, and that itwas wrong to apply them to infinite sets as well. After World War I he started the systematic reconstruction of mathematics. or The intuitionist position is that one can only state “$q$” when one can give either a constructive proof of$p$

pc on sequence that proofs by contradiction (or a constructive proof of q. This standpoint has the reductio ad absurdumof his basis theorem (section 1), achieved by) are not valid. Consider Hilbert’s first proof reductio: he showed that one can derive a contradiction from the assumption that the basis is infinite, and from this he concluded that the basis is finite. The logic behind this procedure is that we start from a concrete instance of PEM, p ∨ ¬p, show that ¬p is untenable, and conclude thatfor explicitp must be true. But constructive mathematics asks procedures for constructing each object that is assumed to exist, and explicit constructions behindany mathematical statement. Similarly, we have mentioned before (section 2.1) Cauchy’s proof of the fun-damental theorem of algebra, as well as many proofs in real analysis that invoke the least upper bound. All ofthese proofs are invalid for a constructivist, and several mathematicians have tried to save the theoremsby finding constructivist proofs for them. For instance, both Weyl and Kneser worked on constructivist proofs for the fundamental theorem of algebra.It is easy to give instances of the use of PEM that a constructivist will not accept: one just has to apply itto any unsolved mathematical problem. For example, Catalan’s constant is the number\infty - n K = n = 0 (2(n + 1)1)2. \text{It is not known whether the statement} “Catalan’s \text{constant is} \text{transcendental},”K is \text{transcendental}, \text{so if} p \text{is then a} \text{constructivist} \text{will not accept thatp is either true or false}. \text{one realizes that} \text{constructivists} \text{have a different viewabout what truth This may seem odd}, \text{or even obviously wrong}, untilis. \text{For a} \text{constructivist}, \text{to say that a proposition is true simply means that we can prove it in accordance with the stringent methods that we are discussing}; \text{to say that it is false means that we can actually exhibit a} \text{counterexample} \text{to it}. \text{Since there isno reason to suppose that every existence statement has either a strict} \text{constructivist} \text{proof or an explicit} \text{counterexample}, \text{there is no reason to believe PEM} (\text{with this notion of truth}). Thus, \text{in order to establish the existence of a natural number with a certain prop} - erty, \text{a proof by reductio ad absurdum is not enough}. \text{Existence must be shown by explicit determination or construction if you want to persuade a} \text{constructivist}. \text{Notice also how this viewpoint implies that mathematics is not timeless or ahistorical}. \text{It was only in}1882 \text{that Lindemann proved that}π \text{is a transcenden} - II. \text{The Origins of Modern Mathematics tal numbersible to assign a truth value to statements that were}[III.41](/part - 03/irrational - and-\text{transcendental} - numbers). Since that date, it has been pos neither true nor false before, according to intuition-ists. This may seem paradoxical, but it was just right for Brouwer, since in his view mathematical objects are mental constructions and he rejected as “metaphysics” the assumption that they have an independent existence. Zermelo by constructive counterparts, which he would In 1918, Brouwer replaced the sets of Cantor and later call “spreads” and “species.” Aa set that has been defined by a characteristic prop-species is basically erty, but with the proviso that previously and independently defined by an explicit every element has been construction. In particular, the definition of any given species will be strictly predicative. tic of intuitionism, and it forms the basis for Brouwer’s The concept of a spread is particularly character is definition of the continuum. It is an attempt to avoid idealization and do justice to the temporal nature of mathematical constructions. Suppose, for example, that we wish to define a sequence of rational numbers that gives better and better approximations to the square root of 2. In classical analysis, one con-ceives of such sequences as existing in their entirety, but Brouwer defined a notion that he called asequence, which pays more attention to how they might choice be produced. One way to produce them is to give a rule, such as the recurrence relation$x = (x2 + 2)/2x$ (and the initial condition make less rigidly determined choices that obey certain$x^{1} = 2)$. But another is to^n^+^1^n^n constraints: for instance, one might insist that denominator$n \text{and that} x^{2}$differs from 2 by at most$x^{n} has$ 100 ensure that the sequence produces better and better/n, which does not determinen xn uniquely but does approximations to$\sqrt{2}$. A choice sequence is therefore not required to be completely specified from the outset, and it can involve choices that are freely made by the mathematician at different moments in time. Both these features make choice sequences very different from the sequences of classical analysis: it has been said that intuitionist mathematics is “mathematics in the making.” By con-trast, classical mathematics is marked by a kind of timeless objectivity, since its objects are assumed tobe fully determined in themselves and independent of the thinking processes of mathematicians. A spread has choice sequences as its elements—it is something like a law that regulates how the sequences

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics are constructed.6 For instance, one could take a spread that consisted of all choice sequences that began insome particular way, and such a spread would represent a segment—in general, spreads do not represent isolated elements, but continuous domains. By using spreads whose elements satisfy the Cauchy condition, Brouwer offered a new mathematical conception of the continuum: rather than being made up of points (or real numbers) with some previous Platonic existence, it wasmore genuinely “continuous.” Interestingly, this view is reminiscent of Aristotle, who, twenty-three centuries earlier, had emphasized the priority of the continuum and rejected the idea that an extended continuum canbe made up of unextended points. sis was to analyze the idea of a function. brouwer defined a function to be an assignment of values to the The next stage in Brouwer’s redevelopment of an a ly elements of a spread. However, because of the nature ofspreads, this assignment had to be wholly dependent on an initial segment of the choice sequence in orderto be constructively admissible. This threw up a big surprise: all functions that are every where defined are continuous (and even uniformly continuous). What, you might wonder, about the function whenx < 0 and f (x) = 1 \text{when xf}⩾where0? \text{For Brouwer}, f (x) = 0 \text{this is not a well}-\text{defined function}, \text{and the underlying reason for this is that one can determine spreads for which we do not know} (\text{and may never know}) \text{whether they are positive}, zero, \text{or negative}. \text{For instance}, \text{one could let}2 n \text{are sums of two primes}, \text{andxn be} 1 \text{if all the even numbers between} 4 and - 1 otherwise. \text{tic negation differs in meaning from classical negation}.Thus, \text{intuitionistic} \text{arithmetic is also different from The rejection of PEM has the effect that intuition is classical arithmetic}.

As Bernays said, this was like “projecting” the deductive structureof a theory T into the number-theoretic domain, and it became possible to express in this domain the consis-tency of T. These realizations raised hopes that a finitary study of formalized proofs would suffice to estab-lish the consistency of the theory, that is, to prove the sentence expressing the consistency ofnot warranted by the previous insights, turned out to T . But this hope, be wrong.8 that not only the logical calculus but also each of the axiomatic systems would be Also, a crucial presupposition of the program was complete. Roughly speaking, this means that they would be sufficiently power-ful to allow the derivation of all the relevant results.9 This assumption turned out to be wrong for systems that contain (primitive recursive) arithmetic, as Gödel showed.It remains to say a bit more about what Hilbert meant bythe points in which his program of the 1920 s adopted finitism (for details, see Tait 1981). This is one of to some extent the principles of intuitionists such as Poincaré and Brouwer and deviated strongly from the ideas Hilbert himself had considered in 1900. The keyidea is that, contrary to the views of logicists like Frege and Dedekind, logic and pure thought require something that is given “intuitively” in our immediate experience: the signs and formulas.In 1905, Poincaré had put forth the view that a formal consistency proof for arithmetic would be circu-lar, as such a demonstration would have to proceed by induction on the length of formulas and proofs, andthus would rely on the same axiom of induction that it was supposed to establish. Hilbert replied in the 1920 sthat the form of induction required at the meta mathematical level is much weaker than full arithmetical induction, and that this weak form is grounded on the

8. For further details, see, for example, Sieg (1999).9. The notion of “relevant result” should of course be made precise: doing so leads to the notion either of syntactic completeness or ofsemantic completeness.

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics finitary consider at i on of signs that he took to be intu-itively given. Finitary mathematics was not in need of any further justification or reduction.Hilbert’s program proceeded gradually by studying weak theories at first and proceeding to progressively stronger ones. The metatheory of a formal system studies properties such as consistency, completeness, andsome others (“completeness” in the logical sense means that all true orin the calculus are formally deducible in it). Proposi-valid formulas that can be represented tional logic was quickly proved to be consistent and complete. First-order logic, also known as predicate logicof 1929. For all of the 1920 s, the attention of Hilbert, was proved complete by Gödel in his dissertation and coworkers was set on elementary arithmetic and its subsystems; once this had been settled, the project was to move on to the much more difficult, but crucial, casesof the theory of real numbers and set theory. Ackermann and von Neumann were able to establish consis-tency results for certain subsystems of arithmetic, but between 1928 and 1930 Hilbert was convinced that the consistency of arithmetic had already been established. Then came the severe blow of Gödel’s incompleteness results (see section 4). gram, came from the fact that Hilbert’ssisted in formalizing each mathematical theory, and The name “formalism,” as a description of this pro-method conformally studying its proof structure. However, thisname is rather one-sided and even confusing, especially because it is usually contrasted with intuition-ism, a full-blown philosophy of mathematics. Like most mathematicians, Hilbert never viewed mathematics asa mere game played with formulas. Indeed, he often emphasized the meaningfulness of (informal) mathe-matical statements and the depth of conceptual content expressed in them.10

3.3 Personal Disputes

The crisis was unfolding not just at an intellectual levelbut also at a personal level. One should perhaps tell this story as a tragedy, in which the personalities ofthe main figures and the successive events made the final result quite inescapable.Hilbert and Brouwer were very different personalities, though they were both extremely willful and clevermen. Brouwer’s worldview was idealistic and tended to solipsism. He had an artistic temperament and an edited by Rowe (1992), and also in the 1930 paper that bears exactly the same title (see10. This is very explicit, for example, in the lectures of 1919–20 Gesammelte Abhandlungen, volume 3).

eccentric private life. He despised the modern world, looking to the inner life of the self as the only way out (at least in principle, though not always in practice). He preferred to work in isolation, although he hadgood friends in the mathematical community, especially in the international group of topologists that gathered around him. Hilbert was typically modernist in his views and attitudes; full of optimism and ratio-nalism, he was ready to lead his university, his country, and the international community into a new world. He was very much in favor of collaboration, and felt happyto join Klein’s schemes for institutional development and power.As a consequence of World War I, Germans in the early 1920 s were not allowed to attend the Interna-tional Congresses of Mathematicians. When the opportunity finally arose in 1928, Hilbert was eager to seize on it, but Brouwer was furious because of restrictions that were still imposed on the German delegation and sent a circular letter in order to convince other math-ematicians. Their viewpoints were widely known and led to a clash between the two men. On another level, Hilbert had made important concessions to his opponents in the 1920 s, hoping that he would succeed in his project of finding a consistency proof. brouwer emphasized these concessions, accusing him of failing to recognize authorship, and demanded new con-cessions.11 Hilbert must have felt insulted and perhaps even threatened by a man whom he regardedas perhaps the greatest mathematician of the younger generation. had since 1915 been a member of the editorial boardof The last straw came with an episode in 1928. Brouwer Mathematische Annalen, the most prestigious mathematics journal at the time, of which Hilbert had beenthe main editor since 1902. Ill with “pernicious anemia,” and apparently thinking that he was close to theend, Hilbert feared for the future of his journal and decided it was imperative to remove Brouwer from the editorial board. When he wrote to other members of the board explaining his scheme, which he was already car-rying out, Einstein replied saying that his proposal was unwise and that he wanted to have nothing to do withit. Other members, however, did not wish to upset the old and admired Hilbert. Finally, a dubious procedure was adopted, where the whole board was dissolved and created anew. Brouwer was greatly disturbed by this Mancosu 1998).11. See his “Intuitionistic reflections on formalism” of 1928 (in

action, and as a result of it the journal lost Einstein and Carathéodory, who had previously been main editors (see van Dalen 2005).After that, Brouwer ceased to publish for some years, leaving some book plans unfinished. With his disap-pearance from the scene, and with the gradual disappearance of previous political turbulences, the feelingsof “crisis” began to fade away (see Hesseling 2003). Hilbert did not intervene much in the subsequent debates and foundational developments. 4 Gödel and the Aftermath It was not only the mathematical community as a whole continued to work Annalen war that Hilbert won: the in the style of modern mathematics. And yet his program suffered a profound blow with the publication of Gödel’s famous 1931 article in the Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik op ment of meta mathematical methods—the arithme-. An extremely ingenious develtization of metamathematics—allowed Gödel to provethat systems like axiomatic set theory or Dedekind Peano arithmetic are incomplete (see[V.15](/part-05/gdels-theorem)). That is, there exist propositionsgödel’s theorem P formulated strictly in the language of the system such that neither P nor ¬P is formally provable in the system. Hilbert’s endeavor, as it shows that formal proof cannot This theorem already presented a deep problem for even capture arithmetical truth. But there was more.A close look at Gödel’s arguments made it clear that this first meta mathematical proof could itself be for-malized, which led to “Gödel’s second theorem”—that it is impossible to establish the consistency of the systems mentioned above by any proof that can be codified within them. Gödel’s arithmetization of metamathematics makes it possible to build a sentence, inthe language of formal arithmetic, that expresses the consistency of this same formal system. And this sen-tence turns out to be among those that are unprovable.12 To express it con tr a positively, a finitary formal proof (codifiable in the system of formal arithmetic)of the impossibility of proving 1= 0 \text{could be trans}-\text{formed into a contradiction of the system}!

II.7. The Crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics fair to say that no general consensus has yet been reached. Whatever its roots and justification may be, mathematics is a human activity. This truism is clear from the subsequent development of our story. The mathematical community refused to abandon “classical” ideas and methods; the constructivist “revolution” was aborted. In spite of its failure, formalism established itself in practice as the avowed ideology of twentieth-century mathematicians. Some have remarked that formalism was less a real faith than a Sunday refuge for those whospent their weekdays working on mathematical objects as something very real. The Platonism of working days was only abandoned, as asaid, when a ready-made reply was needed to unwel-bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) member come philosophical questions concerning mathemati-cal knowledge. One should note that formalism suited very well the needs of a self-conscious, autonomous community ofresearch mathematicians. It granted them full freedom to choose their topics and to employ modern meth-ods to explore them. However, to reflective mathematical minds it has long been clear that it is not the answer. Epistemological questions about mathematical knowledge have not been “eliminated from the world”; philosophers, historians, cognitive scientists, and oth-ers keep looking for more adequate ways of understanding its content and development. Needless to say, this does not threaten the autonomy of mathematical researchers—if autonomy is to be a concern, perhaps we should worry instead about the pressures exertedon us by the market and other powers. Both (semi-)constructivism and modern mathematics have continued to develop: the contrast between them has simply been consolidated, though in a very unbalanced way, since some 99% of practicing mathe-maticians are “modern.” (But do statistics matter when it comes to the correct methods for mathematics?) In 1905, commenting on the French debate,[VI.65](/part-06/jacques-hadamard-18651963) wrote that “there are two conceptions of math-hadamard ematics, two mentalities, in evidence.” It has now cometo be recognized that there is value in both approaches: they complement each other and can coexist peacefully. In particular, interest in effective methods, algorithms, and computational mathematics has grown markedly in recent decades—and all of these are closer to the constructivist tradition. The foundational debate left a rich legacy of ideas and results, key insights and developments, including the formulation of axiomatic set theories and the rise

155

of intuitionism. One of the most important of these developments was the emergence of modern mathematical logic as a refinement of axiomatics, which led tothe theories of recursion and computability in around 1936 (see understanding of the characteristics, possibilities, and algorithms [II.4 §3.2](/part-02/algorithms)). In the process, our limitations of formal systems was hugely clarified.One of the hottest issues through out the whole debate, and probably its main source, was the question of how to understand the continuum. The reader mayrecall the contrast between the set-theoretic understanding of the real numbers and Brouwer’s approach, which rejected the idea that the continuum is “built of” points. That this is a labyrinthine question was further established by results on Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH), which postulates that the cardinality of the set of real numbers isnite cardinal, or equivalently that every infinite subset$א^{1}$, the second transfiof R must biject with either N or with R itself. Gödel proved in 1939 that CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory, but Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that it is independent of its axioms (i.e., Cohen proved thatthe negation of CH is consistent with axiomatic set theory [IV.22 §5](/part-04/set-theory)). The problem is still alive, with a few mathematicians proposing alternative approaches to the continuum and others trying to find new and con-vincing set-theoretic principles that will settle Cantor’s question (see Woodin 2001). a definitive way to clarifying the peculiar style and methodology of modern mathematics, especially the The foundational debate has also contributed in so-called Platonism or existential character of modern mathematics (see the classic 1935 paper of Bernays in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983)), \text{by which is meant}(\text{here at least}) a \text{methodological} \text{trait rather than any supposed implications of metaphysical existence}.

Here is an elegant proof that the answer is yes.Let$x = \sqrt{2} \sqrt^{2}$. If x is rational then we have our example.$But$ x\sqrt2 = \sqrt{2}2 = 2 is rational, so if x is irrational then again we have an example.Now this argument certainly establishes that it is possible fora and b to be irrational and for ab to be rational. However, the proof has a very interesting feature: it is nonconstructive, in the sense that it does not actually name two irrationals Instead, it tells us that either we can take$\text{a and bathat work}$.= b = \sqrt{2} or we can takenot tell us which of these alternatives will work, it gives$a = \sqrt{2} \sqrt^{2} and b = \sqrt{2}$. Not only does it us absolutely no clue about how to find out.Arguments of this kind have troubled some philosophers and philosophically inclined mathematicians, butas far as mainstream mathematics goes they are a fully accepted and important style of reasoning. Formally, we have appealed to the “law of the excluded middle.” We have shown that the negation of the statement cannot be true, and deduced that the statement itself must be true. A typical reaction to the proof above isnot that it is in any sense invalid, but merely that its nonconstructive nature is rather surprising.Nevertheless, faced with a nonconstructive proof, it is very natural to ask whether there is a constructive proof. After all, an actual construction may give usmore insight into the statement, which is an important point since we prove things not only to be surethey are true but also to gain an idea of why they are true. Of course, to ask whether there is a constructive proof is not to suggest that the nonconstructive proof is invalid, but just that it may be more informative tohave a constructive proof.

Typical exam-ples of such rules are the statement that for any set The axiom of choice is one of several rules that we A we can form the set of all its subsets, and the statement that for any set A and any property p we can form the set of all elements of A that satisfy p (these are usually called thehension, respectively). \text{Roughly speaking}, \text{the axiom ofpower}-\text{set axiom and the axiom of com pre choice says that we are allowed to make an arbitrary number of unspecified choices when we wish to form a set}. \text{so natural that one may not even notice that one isusing it}, \text{and indeed it was applied by many math}-\text{Like the other axioms}, \text{the axiom of choice can seem ematicians before it was first formalized}. \text{To get anidea of what it means}, \text{let us look at the well}-\text{known proof that the union of a countable family of countable setsily is countable allows us to write out the sets in a}[III.11](/part - 03/countable - and - uncountable - sets) \text{is countable}. \text{The fact that the famlistual set} A1, AA2, Ais countable allows us to write its elements3, . . . , and then the fact that each individ- in a list finding some systematic way of counting through the(an)n 1, (an)2, (an)3, . . ..

Moreover, since we are told absolutely An without specifying the choice nothing about the setssay how we choose to list them. This remark does not$An$, it is clearly impossible to invalidate the proof, but it does show that it is nonconstructive. (Note, however, that if we are actually toldwhat the sets An are, then we may well be able to spec- ify listings of their elements and thereby give a con-structive proof that the union of those particular sets is countable.)Here is another example. A graph [III.34] is bipartite Y in such a way that no two vertices in the same classif its vertices can be split into two classes X and

are connected by an edge. For example, any even cycle(an even number of points arranged in a circle, with consecutive points joined) is bipartite, while no odd cycle is. Now, is an infinite disjoint union of even cycles bipartite? Of course it is: we just split each of the individual cycleslet X be the union of the sets C into two classes X Xand C and Y be the union YC and then of the sets YC. But how do we choose for each cycle CCwe cannot actually specify how we do this, so we arewhich set to call XC and which to call YC? Again, using the axiom of choice (even if we do not explicitly say so). In general, the axiom of choice states that if we are given a family of nonempty setsan elementxi from each one. More precisely, it states Xi, then we may select that if the X are nonempty sets, where i ranges overi

(More formally, we might say that the function f1 \text{that takes} 11 toof the single set$x1$is a choice function for the “family” that consists$X1$.) For two sets, and indeed for any finite collection of sets, one can prove the existence ofa choice function by induction on the number of sets. But for infinitely many sets it turns out that one cannot deduce the existence of a choice function from theother rules for building sets. choice? The main reason is that if it is used in a proof, then that part of the proof is automatically noncon-Why do people make a fuss about the axiom of structive. This is reflected in the very statement of theaxiom.

III. Mathematical Concepts

[V.3](/part-05/the-banachtarski-paradox). This says that there is a way of dividing upa solid unit sphere into a finite number of subsets and then reassembling these subsets (using rotations, reflections, and translations) to form two solid unit spheres. The proof does not provide an explicit way of defining the subsets.It is sometimes claimed that the axiom of choice has “undesirable” or “highly counter intuitive” consequences, but in almost all cases a little thought reveals that the consequence under consider at i on is actually not counter intuitive at all. For example, consider the Banach–Tarski paradox above. Why does it seem strange and paradoxical? It is because we feel that volume has not been preserved. And indeed, this feeling can be converted into a rigorous argument that the subsets used in the decomposition cannot all be sets towhich one can meaningfully assign a volume. But that is not a paradox at all: we can say what we mean by the volume of a nice set such as a polyhedron, but there isno reason to suppose that we can give a sensible definition of volume forject called measure theory can be used to give a volumeall subsets of the sphere. (The subto a very wide class of sets, called the measurable sets [III.55](/part-03/measures), but there is no reason at all to believe that allsets should be measurable, and indeed it can be shown, again by a use of the axiom of choice, that there are setsthat are not measurable.) There are two forms of the axiom of choice that are more often used in daily mathematical life thanthe basic form we have been discussing. One is the well-ordering principlebe well-ordered [III.66](/part-03/ordinals). The other is, which states that every set can Zorn’s lemma, which states that under certain circumstances “maximal” elements exist. For example, a basis for a vector space is precisely a maximal linearly independent set, and it turns out that Zorn’s lemma applies to the col-lection of linearly independent sets in a vector space, which shows that every vector space has a basis. of choice because they are equivalent to it, in the sensethat each one both implies the axiom of choice and may These two statements are called forms of the axiom be deduced from it, in the presence of the other rulesfor building sets. A good way of seeing why these two other forms of the axiom have a nonconstructive feelto them is to spend a few minutes trying to find a wellordering of the reals, or a basis for the vector space ofall sequences of real numbers. For more about the axiom of choice, and especially about its relationship to the other axioms of formal settheory, see set theory [IV.22](/part-04/set-theory).

III.2 The Axiom of Determinacy

Consider the following “infinite game.” Two players, A and B, take turns to name natural numbers, with Agoing first, say. By doing this, they generate an infinite sequence. A wins the game if this sequence is “eventu-ally periodic,” and B wins if it is not. (An eventually periodic sequence is one like 1,56, 4, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8,3,5, 8 to a recurring pattern.) It is not hard to see that B, 3, . . .: that is, one that settles down after a while has a winning strategy for this game, since eventu-ally periodic sequences are rather special. However, at any stage of the game it is always possible that Awill win (if B plays sufficiently badly), since every finite sequence is the beginning of many eventually periodic sequences. More generally, any collection Sof infinite sequences of natural numbers gives rise to an infinite game: A’sobject is now to ensure that the sequence produced is one of the sequences inthe reverse. The resulting game is called$S$, and B’s object is to ensure determined if one of the two players has a winning strategy. As wehave seen, the game is certainly determined when S is the set of eventually periodic sequences, and indeed for just about any setsee that the corresponding game is determined. Never-S that one writes down it is easy to theless, it turns out that there are games that are not determined. (It is an instructive exercise to see where the plausible-seeming argument, “If A does not have awinning strategy, then A cannot force a win, so B must have a winning strategy,” breaks down.) but the constructions use It is not too hard to construct nondetermined games, the axiom of choice [III.1](/part-03/axiom-of-choice): roughly speaking, one can well-order all possible strate-gies so that each one has fewer predecessors than there are infinite sequences, and select sequences to belongto S or its complement in a way that stops each strat- egy in turn from being a winning strategy for either player. determined. It contradicts the axiom of choice, but itis a rather interesting axiom when it is added to The axiom of determinacy states that all games arethe zermelo–fraenkel axioms turns out, for example, to imply that many sets of[III.99](/part-03/the-zermelofraenkel-axioms) without choice. It reals have surprisingly good properties, such as being Lebesgue measurable. Variants of the axiom of determinacy are closely connected with the theory of large cardinals.

Suppose you throw a pair of standard dice. The proba-bility that the total is 10 is 1 because there are thirtysix ways the dice can come up, of which three (4 and6, 5 and 5, and 6 and 4) give 10.

This would tell us the ratios between the various con-ditional probabilities P[C = n|H ] if we knew what the$160 probabilities P$[C = n] were. Typically, one does not know this, but one makes some kind of guess, called aprior distribution. For example, one might guess, before knowing that three coins had come up heads, that for eachcoins had been chosen wasn between 1 and 10 the probability that1.

These relations have subsequently acquired impor-tance in statistical physics, where they are known as the Yang–Baxter equations.In groups defined by generators and relations it is usually difficult (there being no method that works uniformly in all cases) to decide whether an arbitrary word in the generators represents the identity element(see geometric and combinatorial group theory [IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory)).

Although such similarities suggested that it shouldbe possible to prove that braid groups genuinely are linear, the problem of doing so remained unsolved for many years, until in 2001 a proof was eventually foundby Bigelow and independently by Krammer.

This building is ancan be thought of as a higher-dimensional analogue of aabstract simplicial complex, which graph vertices[III.34]. It consists of a collection of points called; as in a graph, some pairs of vertices form edges; however, it is then possible for triples of vertices to form two-dimensional vertices to form(k - 1)-dimensional “simplexes.” (Thefaces, and for sets of$k$ geometrical meaning of the word “simplex” is a con-vex hull of a finite set of points in general position: for instance, a three-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron.) All faces of simplexes must also be included, so for example three vertices cannot form a two-dimensional face unless each pair is joined by an edge.To form the building of type$A^{-}$, we start by taking all the 1-spaces, 2-spaces, 3-spaces, and so on (corre-$n^{1}$ sponding to points, lines, planes, and so on, in projec-tive space), \text{and treat them as} “vertices.” \text{The simplexes are formed by all nested sequences of proper sub} - spaces: \text{for example}, a 2-\text{space inside a} 4-\text{space inside a} 5-\text{space will form a} “triangle” \text{whose vertices are these three subspaces}. \text{The simplexes of maximal dimen}-\text{sion haven} - 1 vertices: a 1-\text{space inside a} 2-\text{space inside a} 3 - space, \text{and so on}. \text{These simplexes are called chambers}. \text{There are many subspaces}, \text{so a building is a huge object}.

In a spherical building the apartments are tilings of a sphere, but other types of buildings also play signifi-cant roles. Of particular importance are affine buildings, in which the apartments are tilings of Euclidean space; such buildings arise in a natural way from groups, such as GLn(K), where K is a p-adic field [III.51](/part-03/local-and-global-in-number-theory). For such fields there are two buildings, one spherical and oneaffine, but the affine one carries more information and yields the spherical building as a structure “at infin-ity.” Going beyond affine buildings, there are hyperbolic buildings, whose apartments are tilings of hyperbolic space; they arise naturally in the study of hyperbolic Kac–Moody groups.

III.6 Calabi–Yau Manifolds

Eric Zaslow

1 Basic Definition

Calabi–Yau manifolds, named after Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau, arise in Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry, and play a prominent role in string theory and mirror symmetry. to recall the notion of orientability on a realfold In order to explain what they are, we need first[I.3 §6.9](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). Such a manifold is orientable if youmanican choose coordinate systems at each point in sucha way that any two systemsx = (x1, . . . , xm) andygive rise to a positive Jacobian: det= (y1, . . . , ym)that are defined on overlapping sets(\partial yi/\partial xj) > 0. The notion of a Calabi–Yau manifold is the natural complex analogue of this. Now the manifold is complex, and for each local coordinate system z = (z1, . . . , zn) \text{one has avital that holomorphic functionf should be nonvanishing}[I.3 §5.6](/part - 01/fundamental - definitions): \text{that is}$, \text{it neverf} (z)$. It is takes the value 0. There is also a compatibility condi-tion: i\bar{f}z(z) is another coordinate system, then the cor- responding function  ̃$f = f$ ̃$\det (\partial z$ ̃$a/\partial z^{b})$. Note that if we replace all complexf is related to f by the equation terms by real terms in this definition, then we have thenotion of a real orientation. So a Calabi–Yau manifold can be thought of informally as a complex manifold with complex orientation. 2 Complex Manifolds and Hermitian Structure Before we go any further, a few words about complex and Kähler geometry are in order. A complex manifoldis a structure that looks locally like Cn, in the sense that one can find complex coordinates$z = (z^{1}$, . . . , zn) near every point. Moreover, where two coordinate sys-tems$z$and  ̃zoverlap, the coordinates  ̃$z^{a} \text{are holomor}-$ phic when they are regarded as functions of the$z^{b}$. Thus, the notion of a holomorphic function on a com-plex manifold makes sense and does not depend on the coordinates used to express the function. In this way, the local geometry of a complex manifold does indeed look like an open set inpoint looks like Cn itself.Cn, and the tangent space at a Hermitian On complex vector spaces it is natural to consider inner products [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis) represented by hermitian matrices$ea$. On complex manifolds, a Hermitian inner product[III.50 §3](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties)(ga)b^ ̄ with respect to a basis on the tangent spaces is called a “Hermitian metric,”

and is represented in a coordinate basis by a hermitian matrixg , which depends on position.1 ab^ ̄

Whenyour path is a closed loop, the vector at the starting point comes back to a new vector at the same point.(A good example to think about is a path on a sphere that goes from the North Pole to the equator, then aquarter of the way around the equator, then back to the North Pole again. When the journey is completed, the “constant” vector that began by pointing south will have been rotated by 90◦.) With each loop we asso- ciate a matrix operator called thewhich sends the starting vector to the ending vector; holonomy matrix, the group generated by all of these matrices is calledthe holonomy group of the manifold. Since the length of the vector does not change during the process ofkeeping it constant along the loop, the holonomy matrices all lie in the orthogonal group of length-preserving matrices, O(m). If the manifold is oriented, then the holonomy group must lie in SO(m), as one can see by transporting an oriented basis of vectors aroundthe loop. is also a real manifold of (real) dimension which one can think of as coordinatized by the real Every complex manifold of (complex) dimension$m = 2nn$, and imaginary parts of the complex coordinates$z^{j}$. Real manifolds that arise in this way have additional structure. For example, the fact that we can multiply complex coordinate directions by ithat there must be an operator on the real tangent$= \sqrt{-1} implies$ space that squares to±i, which can be thought of as “holomorphic” and-1. \text{This operator has eigenvalues} “anti-holomorphic” directions. The Hermitian property states that these directions are orthogonal, and we say that the manifold istransport around loops.

definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold given above—a Given a complex orientation—that is, the nonmetric compatible Kähler structure lies in SU(n) ⊂ U(n), the natural analogue of the caseleads to a holonomy that of real orientation. This is the metric definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold. 4 The Calabi Conjecture Calabi conjectured that, for any Kähler manifold of complex dimension there exists a functionn and any complex orientation, uand a new Kähler metric  ̃g, given in coordinates by g̃ a^ ̄b = ga^ ̄b + \partial z\partia(la)2\partial u\bar{z}b , \text{that is compatible with the orientation}. \text{In equations}, \text{the compatibility condition states that} \d\text{et ga}^ ̄b + \partial z\partia(la)2\partial u\bar{z}$b = |f |2$, \text{wherecussed above}.

Eugenia Cheng

When we study[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), we pay particular attention to certain classes groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) or vector spaces of maps between them: the important maps between groups are the group homomorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), and the important maps between vector spaces are theear maps [I.3 §4.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). \text{What makes these maps important linis that they are the functions that} “\text{preserve structure}”: \text{for example}, ifφ \text{is a homomorphism from a group} G \text{to a group sense that} Hφ(g, \text{then it} “preserves \text{multiplication},” \text{in theg} ) = φ(g )φ(g ) \text{for any pair of ele} - mentsg1 and (g1()2)2 of G. Similarly, \text{linear maps preserv}(e1)2 \text{addition and scalar} \text{multiplication}.\text{The notion of a structure}-\text{preserving map applies far more generally than just to these two examples}, \text{andone of the purposes of category theory is to understand the general properties of such maps}. \text{For instance}, if B, and C \text{are mathematical structures of some given} A, 165 type, and A to B \text{and fromf and Bgtoare structure}-\text{preserving maps from} C, respectively, \text{then their compos}- ite g◦f is a structure-preserving map from A to C. That is, structure-preserving maps can beif the range of one equals the domain of the other). Wecomposed (at least also use structure-preserving maps to decide when to regard two structures as “essentially the same”: we call A and B isomorphic if there is a structure-preserving map from structure.A to B with an inverse that also preserves one to discuss properties such as these in the abstract.A category is a mathematical structure that allows It consists of a collection ofphisms between those objects. That is, ifobjects, together witha and bmor-are two objects in the category, then there is a collection of morphisms between composition of morphisms: ifa and b. There is also a notion off is a morphism from a to com posi teb and gofis a morphism fromf and g, which is a morphism fromb to c, then there is aa to c. This composition must be associative. In addition, foreach object$a$ there is an “identity morphism,” which has the property that if you compose it with another morphismf then you get f . a category is the category of groups. The objects of As the earlier discussion suggests, an example of this category are groups, the morphisms are group homomorphisms, and composition and the identity are defined in the way we are used to. However, it is by no means the case that all categories are like this, as the following examples show. (i) We can form a category by taking the natural num-bers as its objects, and letting the morphisms from n to m be all the n \times  m matrices with real entries. Composition of morphisms is the usual matrix multiplication. We would not normally think of ann \times  m matrix as a map from the number n to the number nevertheless satisfied.m, but the axioms for a category are (ii) Any set can be turned into a category: the objects are the elements of the set, and a morphism from x to yis the assertion “ x = y.” We can also make an ordered set into a category by letting a mor-phism fromx to ybe the assertion “x ⩽ y.” (The “composite” of “x ⩽ y” and “y ⩽ z” is “x ⩽ z.”) (iii) Any grouplows: you have just one object, and the morphisms G can be made into a category as fol- from that object to itself are the elements of the group, with the group multiplication defining the composition of two morphisms.

(iv) There is an obvious category where the objects are topological spaces [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces) and the morphisms are continuous functions. A less obvious category with the same objects takes as its morphisms not continuous functions but homotopy classes [IV.6 §2](/part-04/algebraic-topology) of continuous functions. Morphisms are also called maps. However, as the above examples illustrate, the maps in a category donot have to be remotely map-like. They are also called arrows, partly to emphasize the more abstract nature of a general category, and partly because arrows areoften used to represent morphisms pictorially. morphisms” enable us to seek and study structural fea-The general framework and language of “objects and tures that depend only on the “shape” of the category, that is, on its morphisms and the equations they satisfy. The idea is both to make general arguments that are then applicable to all categories possessing partic-ular structural features, and also to be able to make arguments in specific environments without having to go into the details of the structures in question. The useof the former to achieve the latter is sometimes referred to, endearingly or otherwise, as “abstract nonsense.” As we mentioned above, the morphisms in a category are generally depicted as arrows, so a morphism

Proving that one long string of compositions equals another then becomes a matter of “filling in” the space inbetween with smaller diagrams that are already known to commute. Further more, many important mathematical concepts can be described in terms of commutative diagrams: some examples are free groups, free rings, free algebras, quotients, products, disjoint unions, function spaces, direct and inverse limits, completion, compact if ic at i on, and geometric realization.

It expresses the fact that givis precisely the same as giving a function from eachof the individual sets; this completely characterizes a disjoint union (which we regard as defined up to isomorphism). Another viewpoint is that the universal property expresses the fact that a disjoint unionis the “most free” way of having two sets map into another set, neither adding any information nor col-lapsing any information. Universal properties are central to the way category theory describes structures that are somehow “canonical.” (See also the discus-sion of free groups in geometric and combinatorial group theory Another key concept in a category is that of an[IV.10](/part-04/geometric-and-combinatorial-group-theory).) isomorphism morphism with a two-sided inverse.

it is one of the basic theorems of algebraic topology that a continuous map between two topological spaces (that takes marked point to marked point) gives rise to a homomorphism between their fundamental groups.Further more, there is a notion of morphism between functors called aogous to the notion of homotopy between maps ofnatural transformation, which is anal topological spaces. Given continuous maps F, G: X \to YX, a homotopy from, a path in Y from Fx F toto GGxgives us, for every point; analogously, given func-x in tors F, G: X −→ Y , a natural transformation from F to GFxgives us, for every pointto Gx. There is also a commuting condition that isx in X, a morphism in Y from analogous to the fact that, in the case of homotopy, apath in X must have its image under F continuously transformed to its image underany “holes” in the space Y. This avoidance of holes is G without passing over expressed in the category case by the commutativity of certain squares in the target categoryas the “naturality condition.”Y , which is known the fact that every vector space isphic to its double dual; there is a functor from the One example of a natural transformation encodes canonically is om or category of vector spaces to itself that takes each vec-tor space to its double dual, and there is an invertible natural transformation from this functor to the iden-tity functor via the canonical isomorphisms. By contrast, every finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to its dual, but not canonically so because the isomorphism involves an arbitrary choice of basis; if we attempt to construct a natural transformation inthis case, we find that the naturality condition fails. In the presence of natural transformations, categories actually form a 2 generalization of a category, with objects, morphisms,-category, which is a two-dimensional and morphisms between morphisms.

All continuous functions are bounded. If$f$:$X \to R is$ a real-valued continuous function on X, then f must be bounded.

To these assertions we can add a fourth (which, like the others, has a rather trivial analogue for finite sets). All open covers have finite subcovers.

For instance, if you know that all sequencesin The above four assertions are closely related to each X contain convergent subsequences, then you can quickly deduce that all continuous functions have amaximum. This is done by first constructing a maximizing sequencef (x ) approaches the maximal value of—a sequence of pointsxnfin(or, more pre-X such that cisely, its supremum)—and then investigating a conver-$n$ gent subsequence of that sequence. In fact, given some fairly mild assumptions on the space X (e.g., that X is a metric space), one can deduce any of these four statements from any of the others. spacefour assertions holds for To oversimplify a little, we say that a topological X is compact if one (and hence all) of the above X. Because the four assertions are not quite equivalent in general, the formal defini-tion of compactness uses only the fourth version: that every open cover has a finite subcover. There are other notions of compactness, such asness, for example, which is based on the third version, sequential compact but the distinctions between these notions are technical and we shall gloss over them here. is used in many ways in many different areas of math-ematics. One is via appeal to local-to-global principles: Compactness is a powerful property of spaces, and it one establishes local control on a function, or on someother quantity, and then uses compactness to boost the local control to global control. Another is to locate maxima or minima of a function, which is particularly useful in the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). A third is to partially recover the notion of a limit when deal-ing with nonconvergent sequences, by accepting the need to pass to a subsequence of the original sequence. (However, different subsequences may converge to dif-ferent limits; compactness guarantees the existence of a limit point, but not its uniqueness.) Compactness ofone object also tends to beget compactness of other objects; for instance, the image of a compact set under a continuous map is still compact, and the productof finitely many or even infinitely many compact sets continues to be compact. This last result is known as Tychonoff’s theorem. An obvious example is the real linepact, because it contains sequences such as 1 Of course, many spaces of interest are not compact.R, which is not com-,2,3, . . . that are “trying to escape” the real line and that do notleave behind any convergent subsequences. However, one can often recover compactness by adding a fewmore points to the space: this process is known as compact if ic at i on. For instance, one can compactify the real

The resulting object, known as the extended real line[−$\i\text{nf ty}$, +$\i\text{nf ty}$], \text{can be given a topology} in a natural way, which basically defines what it meansto converge to$+$\infty or to −$\i\text{nf ty}$. The extended real line is compact: any sequence will have a subsequence that either converges toxn of extended real numbers+$\i\text{nf ty}$, or converges to−\infty, or converges to a finite number. Thus, by using this compact if ic at i on of the real line, we can generalize the notion of a limit to one that no longerhas to be a real number. While there are some drawbacks to dealing with extended reals instead of ordi-nary reals (for instance, one can always add two real numbers together, but the sum of$+$\infty and −$\i\text{nf ty}$ is unde- fined), the ability to take limits of what would otherwise be divergent sequences can be very useful, par-ticularly in the theory of infinite series and improper integrals. many different compactificatio ns. For instance, by the It turns out that a single noncompact space can have device ofcally identify the real line with a circle that has a sin-stereographic projection, one can topologigle point removed.

These simple examples can be general- ized to much more sophisticated examples of compact-ifications, which have many applications in geometry, analysis, and algebra. III.10 Computational Complexity

Classes

One of the basic challenges of theoretical computer sci-ence is to determine what computational resources are necessary in order to perform a given computational task. The most basic resource is time, or equivalently (given the hardware) the number of steps needed toimplement the most efficient algorithm that will carry out the task. Especially important is how this time scales up with the size of the input for the task: for instance, how much longer does it take to factorize an integer with 2 Another resource connected with the feasibility of an digits than an integer with ndigits? computation isage space a computer will need in order to implement memory: one can ask how much storan algorithm, and how this can be minimized. Aplexity class is a set of computational problems that cancombe performed with certain restrictions on the resources allowed. For instance, the complexity class P consists of all problems that can be performed in “polynomialtime”: that is, there is some positive integerk such that if the size of the problem issize was the number of digits of the integer to be fac-n (in the example above, the torized), then the computation can be carried out in at

170

mostnk steps. A problem belongs to P if and only if the time taken to solve it scales up by at most a constant factor when the size of the input scales up by a con-stant factor. A good example of such a problem is multiplication of two n-digit numbers: if you use ordinary long multiplication, then replacing the time taken by a factor of 4. n by 2 n increases ger Suppose that you are presented with a positive inte-x and told that it is a product of two primes p andqknows, but one thing is easy to see: if you are told.

Remarkably, although this is a fundamental distinction, nobody knows howto prove that$P = NP$: this problem is widely considered to be the most important in theoretical computer science. classes.solved using an amount of memory that grows at most We briefly mention two other important complexity PSPACE consists of all problems that can be polynomially with the size of the input. It turns out tobe the natural class associated with reasonable computational strategies for games such as chess. The com-plexity class NC is the set of all Boolean functions that can be computed by a “circuit of polynomial size anddepth at most a polynomial in log$n$.” This last class is a model for the class of problems that can be solved very rapidly using parallel processing. In general, complexity classes are often surprisingly good at character-izing large families of problems with interesting and intuitively recognizable features in common. another remarkable fact is that almost all complexity classes have “hardest problems” within them: that is, problems for which a solution can be converted into a solution forany other problem in the class. These problems are said to be complete for the class in question. These issues, as well as several other complexity classes, are discussed in[IV.20](/part-04/computational-complexity). A vast number of further classes can be found computational complexity at http://qwiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Complexity_Zoo along with a brief definition of each.

III.11 Countable and Uncountable Sets

Infinite sets arise all the time in mathematics: the natu-ral numbers, the squares, the primes, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and so on. It is often natural to try to compare the sizes of these sets: intuitively, one feelsthat the set of natural numbers is “smaller” than the set of integers (as it contains just the positive ones), and much larger than the set of squares (since a typical large integer is unlikely to be a square). But can wemake comparisons of size in a precise way? ition about finite sets. Ifare two ways we might go about comparing their sizes.An obvious method of attack is to build on our intu-A and Bare finite sets, there One is to count their elements: we obtain two nonnega-tive integersm and n and just look at whether m < n, m = n, or m > n. But there is another important method, which does not require us to know the sizes ofeither A or B. This is to pair off elements from A with elements ofof elements: the first one to run out is the smaller set, B until one or other of the sets runs out and if there is a dead heat, then the sets have the samesize. for infinite sets as well: we can declare two sets tobe of equal size if there is a one-to-one correspon-A suitable modification of this second method works dence between them. This turns out to be an important and useful definition, though it does have some consequences that seem a little odd at first. For example, there is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between natural numbers and perfect squares: for each n \text{correspond to} n2. Thus, \text{according to this definitionn we let there are} “\text{as many}” \text{squares as there are natural num} - bers. Similarly, \text{we could show that there are as many primes as natural numbers by associating nth prime number}.1 n \text{with the large}” \text{asspondence between them}. \text{We just list the integers in What about} N, \text{but again we can find a one} - to-\text{one corre} - Z? \text{It seems that it should be} “\text{twice as the order} 0,1,-1, 2, -2, 3, -3, . . . \text{and then match the} sity” \text{that can be useful too}. \text{According to this definition}, \text{the even num}-\text{bers have density}1. \text{For sufficiently nice sets of integers there is a definition of} “den - 1 , \text{while the squares and the primes have density} 0, \text{as one might expect}.

As the above example shows, this is exactly the same as saying that we can An infinite set is called countable if it has the same lista set asthe elements of the set. Indeed, if we have listeda , a , a , . . . , then our correspondence is just to send course many attempted listings that fail: for example,$n^{1} to^{2}(a^{n})^{3}$. It is worth noting that there are of for Z we might have tried-3, -2, -1,0,1,2,3,4, . . . . \text{So it is important to recognize that when we say that aset is countable we are not saying that every attempt to list it works}, \text{or even that the obvious attempt does}: \text{we are merely saying that there is some way of listing the elements}. \text{This is in complete contrast to finite sets}, \text{where if we attempt to match up two sets and find some elements of one set left over}, \text{then we know that the two sets cannot be in one} - to - one \text{correspondence}. \text{It isthis difference that is mainly responsible for the} “\text{odd consequences}” \text{mentioned above}.\text{Now that we have established that some sets that seem smaller or larger than} N, \text{such as the squares or the integers}, \text{are actually countable}, \text{let us turn toa set that seems} “\text{much larger},” namely Q. \text{How could we hope to list all the rationals}? \text{After all}, \text{between anytwo of them you can find infinitely many others}, \text{so it seems hard not to leave some of them out when you try to list them}. However, \text{remarkable as it may seem}, \text{it is possible to list the rationals}. \text{The key idea is that listing the rationals whose numerator and denominator are both smaller} (\text{in modulus}) \text{than some fixed number kis easy}, \text{as there are only finitely many of them}. \text{So we go through in order}: \text{first when both numerator and denominator are at most} 1, \text{then when they are at most} 2, \text{and so on} (\text{being careful not to relist any number}, \text{sothat for example} 1 \text{should not also appear as} 2 or 3). This leads to an ordering such as 03, -3,1, -1,2 ,-2 2,3 ,-3,4$,-4, . . . .,1,-1,2,-2^{4}$,1 2,-6 1 2, larger, such as, for example, thereal numbers, such as We could use the same idea to list sets that look even3 3 3 3 2 2$\sqrt{2}$, that satisfy a polynomial algebraic numbers (all equation with integer coefficients). Indeed, we note that each polynomial has only finitely many roots (which are therefore listable), so all we need to do is list the polynomials (as then we can go through them, in order, listing their roots). And we can do that by applying the same technique again: for eachd we list those polynomials of degree at most coefficients that are at mostd that we have not already listed, withd in modulus.

that Based on the above examples, one might well guess every infinite set is countable. But a beautiful argument ofment, shows that the real numbers are not countable.cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918), called his “diagonal” argu We imagine that we have a list of all real numbers, sayr , r , r , . . . .

For set of all subsets of N is uncountable. Suppose we have listed all the subsets as$A^{1}$, A2$, A3$, . . .. We will define a new set include the point 1 in B that is not equal to any of the B if and only if 1 does not belong An. So we$\text{towe include} 2 in$ A1 (this guarantees that B if and only if 2 does not belong to B is not equal to A1), and A , and so on. It is amusing to note that one can write thisset$B \text{down as} {n \in N}$:$n \in A$, which shows a striking2 resemblance to the set in Russell’s paradox.$n$ Countable sets are the “smallest” infinite sets. However, the set of real numbers is by no means the“largest” infinite set. Indeed, the above argument shows that no setdence with the set of all its subsets. So the set of all X can be put into one-to-one correspon- subsets of the real numbers is “strictly larger” than theset of real numbers, and so on. The notion of countability is often a very fruitful one to bear in mind. For example, suppose we want toknow whether or not all real numbers are algebraic. It is a genuinely hard exercise to write down a particu-lar real that is transcendental [III.41](/part-03/irrational-and-transcendental-numbers) (meaning not algebraic; seerem [V.22](/part-05/liouvilles-theorem-and-roths-theorem) for an idea of how it can be done), but the liouville’s theorem and roth’s theoabove notions make it utterly trivial that transcenden-tal numbers exist. Indeed, the set of all real numbers is

172

uncountable but the set of algebraic numbers is count-able! Further more, this shows that “most” real numbers are transcendental: the algebraic numbers form only atiny proportion of the reals.

However, one can arrive at more sophisticated mixtures of algebra and analysis if one looks at Banach spaces that have more algebraic structure. In particular, while one can add two elements of a Banach space together, one cannot in general multiply them.

A more appropriate name might have been Gelfand algebras.)AC*-algebra is a Banach algebra with an involution, which means a function that associates with each ele-mentx another element x* in such a way that x∗∗ = x, x* = x , (x + y)* = x* + y*$, and (xy)^{*} = y^{*}x^{*}$ for any elements satisfy the$C^{*} - \text{identityx and yxx}$; this involution is required to$^{*} = x^{2}$.

problem: this time, there is “too much” of the surfaceto flatten and you will have to fold it over itself. If, however, you have a roll of wallpaper and wish to flatten it, then there is no difficulty: you just unroll it. Surfaces such as spheres are said to be positively curved, ones with a saddle-like shape arelike a piece of wallpaper are negatively curved flat. , and ones it does not lie in a plane. This is because curvature isdefined in terms of the Notice that a surface can be flat in this sense even ifintrinsic geometry of a surface, where distance is measured in terms of paths that lieinside the surface. There are various ways of making the above notion of curvature precise, and also quantitative, so that witheach point of a surface one can associate a number that tells you “how curved” it is at that point. In order todo this, the surface must have a riemannian metric [I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) on it, which is used to determine the lengthsof paths. The notion of curvature can also be generalized to higher dimensions, so that one can talk aboutthe curvature of a point in ad-dimensional Rieman- nian manifold. However, when the dimension is higher than 2, the way that the manifold can curve at a point is more complicated, and is expressed not by a single number but by the so-called Ricci tensor. See ricci flow [III.78](/part-03/ricci-flow) for more details.Curvature is one of the fundamental concepts of modern geometry: not only the notion just described but also various alternative definitions that measure in other ways how far a geometric object deviates from being flat. It is also an integral part of the theoryof general relativity (which is discussed in general relativity and the einstein equations [IV.13](/part-04/general-relativity-and-the-einstein-equations)). III.14 Designs Peter J. Cameron Block designs were first used in the design of experiments in statistics, as a method for coping with sys-tematic differences in the experimental material. Suppose, for example, that we want to test seven differ-ent varieties of seed in an agricultural experiment, and that we have twenty-one plots of land available for the experiment. If the plots can be regarded as identical, then the best strategy is clearly to plant three plotswith each variety. Suppose, however, that the available plots are on seven farms in different regions, with three plots on each farm. If we simply plant one variety on each farm, we lose information, because we cannot dis-tinguish systematic differences between regions from

It is better to followa scheme like this: plant varieties 1, 2, 3 on the first farm; 1, 4, 5 on the second; and then 1, 6, 7; 2, 4, 6; 2, 5, 7; 3, 4, 7; and 3, 5, 6. This design is represented infigure 1. block design sets of seed varieties used on the seven farms. The This arrangement is called a, or BIBD for short.

In our we could not use a BIBD for the experiment, but wouldhave to choose the most “efficient” possible design (allowing the most information to be obtained from the experimental results). A BIBD is most efficient if itexists; but not much is known in other cases. There are other types of design; these can be important to statistics and also lead to new mathematics.Here, for example, is an orthogonal array: if you take any two rows of this matrix you obtain a 2$\times 9 matrix$ in which each ordered pair of symbols from$\\{0}$,1,2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\} occurs exactly once as a column. 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 0 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 0 It could be used if we had four different treatments, each of which could be applied at three different levels, and if we had nine plots available for testing. Design theory is closely related to other combinatorial topics such as error-correcting codes; indeed, Fisher “discovered” the Hamming codes as designs five years before R. W. Hamming found them in the context of error correction. Other related subjects include pack-ing and covering problems, and especially finite geometry, where many finite versions of classical geometries can be regarded as designs.

III.15 Determinants

is defined to bead - bc. The determinant of a 3 \times  3 matrix⎛a b c⎞⎜⎜⎝d e f ⎟⎟⎠g h i

is defined to beaei+bf g+cdh-af h-bdi-ceg. What do these expressions have in common, how do they generalize, and why is the generalization significant? simple observations. Both expressions are sums and differences of products of entries from the matrix. Each To begin with the first question, let us make a few one of these products contains exactly one element from each row of the matrix and also exactly one element from each column. In both cases, a minus signseems to attach itself to the products for which the entries selected from the matrix “slope upward” rather than “downward.” definition totake sums and differences of all possible products of Up to a point it is easy to see how to extend thisn \times  n matrices with n ⩾ 4. We simply none from each column. The difficulty comes in decid-entries, where one entry from each row is used and ing which of these products to add and which to sub-tract. To do this we take one of the products and use it to define a permutation follows. For eachi ⩽ n, the product contains exactlyσ of the set \\{1,2, . . . , n\\} as one entry in thethenσ (i) = j. The product is added if this permutation ith row. If it belongs to the jth column is even and subtracted if it is odd (seegroups [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups)). So, for example, the permutation cor-permutation responding to the entryaf h in the 3 \times  3 determinant above sends 1 to 1, 2 to 3, and 3 to 2. This is an odd permutation, which is whyaf h receives a minus sign. products and minus signs that we have just definedis important. The reason is that it tells us something We still need to explain why the particular choice of about the effect of a matrix when it is considered as alinear map. Let A be an n \times  n matrix. Then, as explained in [I.3 §3.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), Aspecifies a linear mapα from Rn to Rn. The determinant ofdoes to volumes. More precisely, if A tells us what this linear map X is a subset of Rn with transformingn-dimensional volume X using the linear map V , then αXα, will have vol-, the result of

The corresponding linear map is a rotation of R2 through an angle ofaffect its volume, we should expect the determinant ofθ. Since rotating a shape does not A to be 1, and sure enough it is cos^2 θ + \sin^2 θ, which is 1 by Pythagoras’s theorem. tion in one respect: determinants can be negative, but clearly volumes cannot. If the determinant of a matrix The above explanation is a slight over sim pl if i ca is-2, to give an example, it means that the linear map multiplies volumes by 2 but also “turns shapes insideout” by reflecting them. become obvious once one knows the above interpre-tation in terms of volumes. (However, it is much less Determinants have many useful properties, which obvious that this interpretation is correct: in setting up the theory of determinants one must do some work somewhere.) Let us give three of these properties. (i) Let V be a vector space[I.3 §2.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) and letα:$V \to V$ be a linear map. Let A be the matrix of α vwith respect to this basis. Now let1, . . . , vn be a basis of V and letwof1α, . . . , with respect to this different basis. Thenwn be another basis of V and let B be the matrix A and B are different matrices, but since they both represent the linear map volumes. It follows that detα, they must have the same effect on$(A) = \det (B)$. To put this another way: the determinant is better thought of as aproperty of linear maps rather than of matrices. Two matrices that represent the same linear map in the above sense are calledand B are similar if and only if there is an invertible similar. It turns out that A matrix P such that P-1 AP = B. (An n \times  n matrix P is invertible then \times  n if there is a matrix identity matrix, I , which turns out to imply Q such that P Q equals that called the QP equals inverse Inofas well. If this is true, then P and is denotedn P-1.) What we Q is have just shown is that similar matrices have the same determinant. represent linear maps(ii) If A and B are any twoα andn \times βnofmatrices, then they Rn.

The converse of this turns out to be true as well: a matrix with nonzero determinant is invertible. Thus, the determinant gives us a way of finding out whethera matrix can be inverted.

Integration

Terence Tao

It goes without saying that integration is one of the fundamental concepts of single-variable calculus. How-ever, there are in fact three concepts of integration that appear in the subject: theknown as the antiderivative indefinite integral), the unsigned definite inte-f (also gral[a, b] f (x) dx(which one would use to find the area under a curve, or the mass of a one-dimensional object of varying density), and the signed definite integral compute the work required to move a particle fromab f (x) dx (which one would use, for instance, toa tob functions).

This segment also has many other par a me tr iz at i ons, such as  ̃γ(t) = (1 - t2)a + t2 b; however, as in the one dimensional case, the exact choice of parametrization does not ultimately influence the integral.

To see what this might mean, and in particular to seewhy dω is a (k + 1)-form, let us think how we might answer a question of the following kind. We are givena spherical surface in R3 and a flow, and we would like to know the net flux out of the surface: that is, the dif-ference between the amount of flux coming out and the amount going in. One way to do this would be to approximate the surface of the sphere by a union of tiny parallelograms, to measure the flux through each one, and to take the sum of all these fluxes. another would be to approximate the solid sphere by a union of tiny parallelepipeds, to measure the net flux out of each of these, and to add up the results. If a parallelepiped issmall enough, then we can closely approximate the net flux out of it by looking at the difference, for each pair of opposite faces, between the amount coming out ofthe parallelepiped through one and the amount going into it through the other, and this will depend on the rate of change of the 2-form. parallelepipeds is more rigorously described as inte-The process of summing up the net fluxes out of the grating a 3-form over the solid sphere. In this way, onecan see that it is natural to expect that information about how a 2-form varies should be encapsulated in a 3-form. a little bit of algebra and is omitted here. However, The exact construction of these operations requires we remark that they obey similar laws to their scalar counterparts, except that there are some sign changes that are ultimately due to the antisymmetry (9). \text{For instance}, \text{if commutative law for} \text{multiplication} becomesω \text{is a} k-\text{form and} η \text{is an} l - form, theω ∧ η = (-1)klη ∧ ω, 179 \text{basically because dimensions with}\text{lkl dimensions}; \text{and the derivation ruleswaps are needed to interchange} k for differentiation becomes d$(ω ∧ η) = (dω) ∧ η + (-1)^{k}ω ∧ (dη)$. Another rule is that the differentiation operator d isnilpotent: d(dω) = 0. (11) This may seem rather unintuitive, but it is fundamen-tally important. To see why it might be expected, let us think about differentiating a 1-form twice. The orig-inal 1-form associates a scalar with each small line segment. Its derivative is a 2-form that associates a scalar with each small parallelogram. This scalar essentially measures the sum of the scalars given by the 1-formas you go around the four edges of the parallelogram, though to get a sensible answer when you pass to the limit you have to divide by the area of the parallelo-gram. If we now repeat the process, we are looking at a sum of the six scalars associated with the six facesof a parallelepiped. But each of these scalars in turn comes from a sum of the scalars associated with thefour directed edges around the corresponding face, and each edge is therefore counted twice (as it belongs totwo faces), once in each direction. Therefore, the contributions from each edge cancel and the sum of all contributions is zero. tween integrating a 2-form over the surface of a sphere The description given earlier of the relationship beand integrating its derivative over the solid sphere canbe thought of as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, and can itself be generalized considerably: Stokes’s theorem is the assertion that for any oriented manifold oriented boundary of SSd(which we will not define here).ωS=\text{and form}\partial S ω ω, where \partial S is the(12) Indeed one can view this theorem as a definition of the derivative operationω \to dω; thus, \text{differentiation} \text{is the identity} (11) \text{is dual to the geometric observation that adjoint of the boundary operation}.

Then have used the left-hand rule to provide this identification, and apartfrom some harmless sign changes here and there, one gets essentially6. This is an entirely arbitrary convention; one could just as easily the same theory as a consequence.

Similar definitions can be given for other differen-tial forms. The pullback operation enjoys several nice properties: for instance, it respects the wedge product,

$Φ^{*}(ω ∧ η) = (Φ^{*}ω) ∧ (Φ^{*}η)$,

and the derivative,

d$(Φ^{*}ω) = Φ^{*}(dω)$.

By using these properties, one can recover rather painlessly the change-of-variables formulas in severalvariable calculus. Moreover, the whole theory carries over effortlessly from Euclidean spaces to other manifolds. It is because of this that the theory of differ-ential forms and integration is an indispensable tool in the modern study of manifolds, and especially in differential topology [IV.7](/part-04/dierential-topology). III.17 Dimension What is the difference between a two-dimensional set and a three-dimensional set? A rough answer that onemight give is that a two-dimensional set lives inside a plane, while a three-dimensional set fills up a portion of

space. Is this a good answer? For many sets it does seemto be: triangles, squares, and circles can be drawn in a plane, while tetrahedra, cubes, and spheres cannot. But how about the surface of a sphere? This we would nor-mally think of as two dimensional, contrasting it with the solid sphere, which is three dimensional. But the surface of a sphere does not live inside a plane. Does this mean that our rough definition was incorrect? Not exactly.

Suppose that X is a set and x and y are points in X . Let us call a setis no continuous path from Y a barrier xbetweento y that avoidsx and y if there Y . For example, ifcenter of X, and X is a solid sphere of radius 2, y is a point on the boundary ofx Xis the, then one possible barrier betweenx and y is the surface of a sphere of radius 1.

This makes$X$ zero dimensional and therefore makes the plane one dimensional, which is not satisfactory. A small modification to the above definition eliminates such patholo-gies and gives a definition that was put forward by brouweris said to have dimension at most[VI.75](/part-06/luitzen-egbertus-jan-brouwer-18811966).

Then you will beforced to make the shorter ones overlap, but you can do it in such a way that no point is contained in morethan two of your intervals: just start each new interval close to the end of the previous one. (that is, one that does not contain its boundary) with smaller open squares. Again you will be forced to make Now suppose that you want to cover an open square the smaller squares overlap, but this time the situationis slightly worse: some points will have to be contained in three squares. However, if you take squares arranged like bricks, as in figure 1, and expand them slightly, then you can do the covering in such a way that nofour squares overlap. In general, it seems that to cover a typical need to have overlaps ofd-dimensional set with small open sets, youd + 1 sets but you do not need to have overlaps greater than this.The precise definition that this leads to is surprisingly general: it makes sense not just for subsets of R$n$ but even for an arbitrary topological space [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces). We say that a setever you cover X Xwith a finite collection of open setsis at mostd dimensional if, how-

And again it can be shown that this definition We then define thed such that topological dimension X is at most dofdimen-X to assigns the “correct” dimension to the familiar shapes of elementary geometry.A fourth intuitive idea leads to concepts known as homological with any suitable topological spaceand cohomological dimension. Associated X, such as a man- ifold, are sequences of groups known asand cohomology groups [IV.6 §4](/part-04/algebraic-topology). Here we will dis-homology cuss homology groups, but a very similar discussion is possible for cohomology. Roughly speaking, the$nth$ homology group tells you how many interestingly dif-ferent continuous maps there are from closedn-dimen- sional manifolds less thann, then it can be shown that the M to X. If X is a manifold of dimension nth homology group is trivial: in a sense, there is not enough room in Xto define any map that is interestingly different from a constant map. On the other hand, thegroup of then-sphere itself is Z, which says that onenth homology can classify the maps from themeans of an integer parameter.n-sphere to itself by It is therefore tempting to say that a space is at least ning maps from dimensional if there is room inside it for interest-n-dimensional manifolds. This thought leads to a whole class of definitions. The homological dimension of a structure Xis defined to be the largest nnth homology group. (It is necessary to consider sub-for which some substructure of X has a nontrivial structures, because homology groups can also be trivial when there is too much room: it then becomes easy to deform a continuous map and show that it is equiva-lent to a constant map.) However, homology is a very general concept and there are many different homology theories, so there are many different notions of homo-logical dimension. Some of these are geometric, but there are also homology theories for algebraic struc-tures: for example, using suitable theories, one can

III.17. Dimension

define the homological dimension of algebraic struc-tures such as rings [III.81 §1](/part-03/rings-ideals-and-modules) or groups [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions). This is a very good example of geometrical ideas having an algebraic payoff.Now let us turn to a fifth and final (for this article at least) intuitive idea about dimension, namely the way itaffects how we measure size. If you want to convey how big a shape X is, then a good way of doing so is to give the length oftwo dimensional, and the volume if it is three dimen-X if X is one dimensional, the area if it is sional. Of course, this presupposes that you already know what the dimension is, but, as we shall see, there is a way of deciding which measure is the most appropriate Then the tables are turned: we can actually without determining the dimension in advance.define the dimension to be the number that corresponds to thebest measure. To do this, we use the fact that length, area, and volume scale in different ways when you expand a shape.If you take a curve and expand it by a factor of 2 (in all directions), then its length doubles. More generally, ifyou expand by a factor of C, then the length multiplies byexpand it by C. However, if you take a two-dimensional shape and C, then its area multiplies by C2. (Roughly speaking, this is because each little portion of the shape expands by C“\text{in two directions}” \text{so you have to multiply the area by dimensional shape multiplies by} C twice.) \text{And the volume of a three} - C3: \text{for instance}, \text{the volume of a sphere of radius} 3 \text{is twenty}-\text{seven timesthe volume of a sphere of radius} 1. \text{advance whether we will talk about length}, area, \text{or vol}-\text{It may look as though we still have to decide in ume before we can even begin to think about how the measurement scales when we expand the shape}. \text{But this is not the case}. \text{For instance}, \text{if we expand a squareby a factor of} 2, \text{then we obtain a new square that can be divided up into four congruent copies of the original square}. So, \text{without having decided in advance that we are talking about area}, \text{we can say that the size of thenew square is four times that of the old square}. \text{there are sets to which it is natural to assign a dimen}-\text{This observation has a remarkable consequence}: \text{sion that is not an integer}! \text{Perhaps the simplest exam}-\text{ple is a famous set first defined by cantor} [VI.54](/part - 06/georg - cantor - 18451918) \text{and now known as the follows}. \text{You start with the closed interval Cantor set}. \text{This set is produced as}[0, 1], and call itdle third of$X0$.

Once you(Xn)+1 consists of twice as many have produced the sequence$n X^{0}$, X1$, X2$, . . ., you define the Cantor set to be the intersection of all the$X$: that

It is not hard to show that these are precisely the numbers whose ternary expansions consist just of 0 s and 2 s. (There are some numbers that have two different ternary expansions. For instance, be written either as 0.1 or as 0.02222 . . .. In such case(s1)3 can we take the recurring expansion rather than the ter-minating one. So 1 belongs to the Cantor set.) Indeed, when you remove middle thirds for the3 nth time, you are removing all numbers that have a 1 in theafter the “decimal” (in fact, ternary) point.nth place The Cantor set has many interesting properties. For example, it issure [III.55](/part-03/measures) zero. Briefly, the first of these assertions uncountable [III.11](/part-03/countable-and-uncountable-sets), but it also has meafollows from the fact that there is a different element of the Cantor set for every subset bers (just take the ternary number 0 A of the natural num-.a a a . . ., whereaare uncountably many subsets of the natural numbers.i = 2 whenever i \in  A and ai = 0 otherwise), \text{and ther}(e1()2){3}To justify the second, note that the total length of the intervals making up X is (2)n (\text{since one removes a} third ofcontained in every(Xn)-1 \text{to produce} Xn, its measure must be smaller (Xn)3). Since the Cantor set is thanzero. Thus, the Cantor set is very large in one respect$(^{2}^{3})^{n}$, whatever nnis, which means that it must be and very small in another. A further property of the Cantor set is that it is selfsimilar look at just one of these intervals as the middle thirds. The set X1 consists of two intervals, and if you are repeatedly removed, then what you see is just like the construction of the whole Cantor set, but scaled down by a factor of 3. That is, the Cantor set consists of two copies of itself, each scaled down by a factorof 3. From this we deduce the following statement: if you expand the Cantor set by a factor of 3, then you candivide the expanded set up into two congruent copies of the original, so it is “twice as big.” What consequence should this have for the dimension of the Cantor set? Well, if the dimension isd, then

As we shall see in a moment, a theory of fractional dimension can be developed with the use-Once one knows this, the mystery of the Cantor set ful property that a countable union of sets of dimen-sion at mostd has dimension at most d. Therefore, the fact that the Cantor set has dimension greater than 0 implies that it cannot be countable (since single points have dimension 0). On the other hand, because the dimension of the Cantor set is less than 1, it is much smaller than a one-dimensional set, so it is no surprise that its measure is zero. (This is a bit like saying thata surface has no volume, but now the two dimensions are 0.63 and 1 instead of 2 and 3.)The most useful theory of fractional dimension is one developed by hausdorff [VI.68](/part-06/felix-hausdor-18681942). One begins with a concept known as Hausdorff measure, which is a nat-ural way of assessing the “$d$-dimensional volume” of a set, even ifin R3 and you want to work out its length by consider-d is not an integer. Suppose you have a curve ing how easy it is to cover it with spheres. A first idea might be to say that the length was the smallest youcould make the sum of the diameters of the spheres. But this does not work: you might be lucky and find thata long curve was tightly wrapped up, in which case you could cover it with a single sphere of small diameter. spheres were required to be small. Suppose, therefore, that we require all the diameters of the spheres to be However, this would no longer be possible if your at mostsum of the diameters to be. The smallerδ. Let L(δ) be the smallest we can then get theδ is, the less flexibility we have, so the larger L(δ)tends to a (possibly infinite) limit L(δ) will be. Therefore, L as δ tends to 0, and we call Now suppose that we have a smooth surface in L the length of the curve. R3 and want to deduce its area from information about covering it with spheres. This time, the area that you can cover with a very small sphere (so small that itmeets only one portion of the surface and that portion is almost flat) will be roughly proportional to thesquare of the diameter of the sphere. But that is the only detail we need to change: letcan make the sum of the squares of the diameters of a A(δ) be the smallest we set of spheres that cover the surface, if all those spheres have diameter at mostδ. Then declare the area of the surface to be the limit of A(δ) as δ \text{tends to} 0.

A larger example is a very wiggly curve known as the snowflake. Because it is a curve (and a single point is Koch enough to cut it into two) it has topological dimen-sion 1.

In analysis, it is helpful to think Of course, all these notions of function and functionof the various notions of a function as forming a spec-trum, with very “smooth” classes of functions at one end and very “rough” ones at the other. The smooth classes of functions are very restrictive in their membership: this means that they have good properties, andthere are many operations that one can perform on them (such as, for example, differentiation), but it also means that one cannot necessarily ensure that the func-tions one is working with belong to this category. Conversely, the rough classes of functions are very general and inclusive: it is easy to ensure that one is working with them, but the price one pays is that the number of operations one can perform on these functions is often sharply reduced (see function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces)). often be treated in a unified manner, because it is Nevertheless, the various classes of functions can often possible to approximate rough functions arbitrar-ily well (in an appropriate topology [III.90](/part-03/topological-spaces)) by smooth ones. Then, given an operation that is naturally defined for smooth functions, there is a good chance that therewill be exactly one natural way to extend it to an operation on rough functions: one takes a sequence of better and better smooth approximations to the rough func-tions, performs the operation on them, and passes to the limit. rough end of the spectrum, but before we say what Distributions, or generalized functions, belong at the they are, it will be helpful to begin by considering some smoother classes of functions, partly for comparison and partly because one obtains rough classes of func-tions from smooth ones by a process known as duality: ais simply a linear maplinear functional defined on a spaceφ from E to the scalars E of functions R or C.

Since test functions have so many-δ0$, g = g^ (0)$. (The reason for the minus sign operations available to them, there are many ways todefine continuous linear functionals, so the class of distributions is quite large.

Thus,$n \in ^{Z})^{0}$ the space of distributions is quite a good space to workin, in that it contains a large class of functions (e.g., all measures and integrable functions), and is also closed under a large number of common operations in analy-sis. Because the test functions are dense in the space of distributions, the operations as defined on distributions are usually compatible with those on test func-tions. For instance, iff and g are test functions andf^  = g in the sense of distributions, then f^  = g will also be true in the classical sense. This often allowsone to manipulate distributions as if they were test functions without fear of confusion or inaccuracy. The main operations one has to be careful about are evalua-tion and pointwise multiplication of distributions, both of which are usually not well-defined (e.g., the square of the Dirac delta distribution is not well-defined as a distribution). \text{Another way to view distributions is as the weak limit of test functions}.

The complement of the com-A, so there is a kind of dual- ity between sets and their complements.laws are the statements that$(A ∩ B)c =$ De Morgan’s Ac ∪ Bc and(A ∪ B)c = Ac ∩ Bc: they tell us that complement at i on “turns intersections into unions,” and vice versa. Notice that if we apply the first law to Ac and Bc, then we find that(Ac ∩ Bc)c = A ∪ B. Taking complements of both sides of this equality gives us the second law. ing unions and intersections remains true when you interchange them. For example, one useful identity is Because of de Morgan’s laws, any identity involv$A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)$. Applying this to the complements of the sets and using de Morgan’s laws, itis straightforward to deduce the equally useful identity

If X is an explicit exam-fis defined to be ple of a Banach space (such as one of the spaces dis-cussed in function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces)), it can be extremely useful to have an explicit description of the dual space.That is, one would like to find an explicitly described Banach space Y and a way of associating with each nonzero element functionalφdefined ony of Y a nonzero continuous linear X, in such a way that every continuous linear functional is equal to$y \in Y$.y φy \text{for some} and From this perspective, it is more natural to regard Yas having the same status.

Two characters can be multi-plied together in an obvious way, and this multiplication makes the set of all characters on Abelian group, called the dual group, ˆG, of the group G into another G. Again, ifimposes an additional continuity condition.G has a topological structure, then one usually An important example is when the group is itself T. It is not hard to show that the continuous homomor-phisms from T to T all have the form ei$θ \to (e^{i})^{n}θ for$ some integer the dual of Tnis (isomorphic to)(which may be negative or zero). Thus, Z. tryagin duality ing between This form of duality between groups is called$G$.

The article on[IV.16](/part-04/mirror-symmetry) discusses an astonishing (and still largely con-mirror symmetry jectural) duality between and so-called “mirror manifolds.” Often the mirror calabi–yau manifolds [III.6](/part-03/calabiyau-manifolds) manifold is much easier to understand than the origi-nal manifold, so this duality, like the Fourier transform, makes certain calculations possible that would otherwise be unthinkable. And the article ontion theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) discusses the “Langlands dual” of represent a certain (non-Abelian) groups: a proper understanding of this duality would solve many major open problems. III.20 Dynamical Systems and Chaos From a scientific point of view, a dynamical system is aphysical system, such as a collection of planets or the water in a canal, that changes over time. Typically, the positions and velocities of the parts of such a system at a timeties of those parts just before that time, which meanst depend only on the positions and veloci- that the behavior of the system is governed by a systemof partial differential equations [I.3 §5.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).

Sometimes, as above, “just beforehand” refers toa time infinitesimally earlier, which is why calculus is involved. But there is also a vigorous theory of discrete dynamical systems, where the “time”values, and the “time just before$t$” istt-takes integer1. If f is the function that tells us how the system at timeon the system at timet - 1, then the system as a wholet depends can be thought of as the process ofapplyingf over and over again. iterating f: that is, function iterate it enough times.

Because the relevant equations are chaotic, the resulting inaccuracies, which may be small to start with, rapidly propagate and overwhelm the system: youcould start with a different, equally good approximation and find that after a fairly short time the systemhad evolved in a completely different way. This is why accurate forecasting is impossible more than a few days in advance.For more about dynamical systems and chaos, see dynamics [IV.14](/part-04/dynamics). III.21 Elliptic Curves Jordan S.

In this sense, an ellip- inition has given rise to a subject of seemingly inexhaustible mathematical interest, which has provided atremendous fund of ideas, examples, and problems in number theory and algebraic geometry. This is in part because there are many values of “$X$” for which it is the case that “the simplest interesting example of X is an elliptic curve.”For instance, the points of an elliptic curve E with coordinates inwhich we call E(K)K naturally form an Abelian group,. The connected projective vari- eties [III.95](/part-03/varieties) that admit a group law of this kind are calledthe Abelian varieties that are one dimensional.

III.22 The Euclidean Algorithm and

Continued Fractions

1 The Euclidean Algorithm

the fundamental theorem of arithmetic [V.14](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic),

which states that every integer can be factored into primes in a unique way, has been known since antiquity. The usual proof depends upon what is known as the Euclidean algorithm, which constructs the highest common factor (h, say) of two numbers m and n. In doing so, it shows thatam+ bn for some pair of integersh can be written in the forma, b (not necessarily positive). \text{For example}, \text{the highest common factor of} 17 and 7 is 1, \text{and sure enough we can express} 1 \text{as the combination} 1= 5 \times 17 - 12 \times 7. The algorithm works as follows. Assume thatm is larger than quotientq nand a nonnegative remainder and start by dividing m byr nthat is lessto yield a than$n$. \text{Then we hav}(e1)1 m = q1 n + r1. (1)

Now since second quotient and remainder: r1 < n we may divide n by r1 to obtain an = q2 r1 + r2. (2)

Continue in this way, dividingon. The remainders get smaller each time but cannot$r^{1} by r^{2}$, r2 by r3, and so go below zero. So the process must stop at some pointwith a remainder of 0: that is, with a division that comes out exactly. For instance, if$m = 165 and n = 70$, the algorithm generates the sequence of divisions 165$= 2 \times 70 + 25$, (3) 70$= 2 \times 25 + 20$, (4) 25$= 1 \times 20 + 5$, (5)$20$= 4 \times 5 + 0. (6)

192

The process guarantees that the last nonzero remain-der, 5 in this case, is the highest common factor of$m$ andn. On the one hand, the last line shows that 5 is a factor of the previous remainder 20. Now the last-but-one line shows that 5 is also a factor of the remainder 25 that occurred one step earlier, because 25 isexpressed as a combination of 20 and 5. Working back up the algorithm we conclude that 5 is a factor of bothm = 165 and n = 70. So 5 is certainly a common factor of On the other hand, the last-but-one line shows thatm and n. 5 can be written as a combination of 25 and 20 with integer coefficients. Since the previous line shows that 20 can be written as a combination of 70 and 25 we canwrite 5 in terms of 70 and 25: 5$= 25 - 20 = 25 - (70 - 2 \times 25) = 3 \times 25 - 70$. Continuing back up the algorithm we can express 25 in terms of 165 and 70 and conclude that 5$= 3 \times (165 - 2 \times 70) - 70 = 3 \times 165 - 7 \times 70$. of 165 and 70 because any factor of 165 and 70 would automatically be a factor of 3 This shows that 5 is the\times highest165 - 7 common factor\times70: that is, a factor of 5. Along the way we have shown that the high-est common factor can be expressed as a combination of the two original numbersm and n. 2 Continued Fractions for Numbers During the 1500 years following Euclid, it was realizedby mathematicians of the Indian and Arabic schools that the application of the Euclidean algorithm to a pairof integersm and n could be encoded in a formula for the ratiom/n. The equation (1) can be writtenmn = q1 + rn1 = q1 + F1 ,

where$F = n/r^{1}$. Now equation (2) expressesr2 F as F = q2 + r1.

The next step of the algorithm will produce an expres-sion forr /r and so on. If the algorithm stops afterk steps, then we can put these expressions together t(o1)2 get what is called the continued fraction for$m/n$:

The numbers 3, 7, 15, and so on, that appear in the fraction are called the The continued fraction for a real number can be used partial quotients ofπ. to approximate it by rational numbers. If we truncate the continued fraction after several steps, we are left with a finite continued fraction which is a rational num-ber: for example, by truncating the fraction (7), one level down we get the familiar approximation3$+ 1/7 = 22/$7; at the second level we get the approx-$π \approx$ imation 3$+ 1/(7 + 1/15) = 333/106$. \text{The truncations} at different levels thus generate a sequence of rational approximations: the sequence forπ begins$3$, 22/7, 333/106, 355/113, . . . .

So we are not changing the fraction much by ignoring the tail 1$/(292 + 1/(1 +$. ..)). In this sense, the most difficult number to approximate by fractions is the one with the smallest possible partial quotients, i.e., the one with all its partial quotients equal to 1.

For instance, if we truncate rational functions: functions that the fraction for the tangent after one level, then we getthe approximation \tan x \approx 1 - xx2/3 = 3 - 3 xx2. This continued fraction, and the rapidity with which its truncations approach tanx, played the central role in the proof thattwo whole numbers. The proof was found by Johannπis irrational: thatπ is not the ratio of Lambert in the 1760 s. He used the continued fractionto show that ifx is a rational number (other than 0), then tanx is not. But tanπ/4 = 1 (which certainly is rational), so$π/4 \text{cannot be}$. III.23 The Euler and Navier–Stokes

Navier–Stokes simulations exhibit no evidence of breakdown, but this may mean only that initial velocities$u^{0} that$ lead to breakdown are exceedingly rare. Solutions of3 D Euler behave very wildly, so that it is hard to decide whether a given numerical study indicates abreakdown.

Leray in the 1930 s, p(x, t) is unbounded, both above and below. is to study “weak solutions” of the Navier–Stokes equations. The idea is as follows.

Applying this remark to th(e R)n Fθ dx = 0 for 3 D Navier–Stokes equations (2) and (3) and performing a simple formal computation (an integration by parts), we find that (2) and (3) are equivalent to the following equations: R3\times(0\\{,\\ \infty) - i = 3 1 ui \partialθ\partial ti - i, j3 = 1 uiuj \partial x\partialθi j \text{dx dt} = R 3\times(0,\infty) \nui, j3 = 1 \partial x\partial2 2 j θ\text{i ui} + i = 3 1 \partialθ\partial(xi)i p \text{dx dt} (2}$) and R3$\times(0,\infty)i = 1 ui \partial x\partialφ\text{i dx dt} = 0.

A two-dimensional fluid that is initially at rest and subject to no outside forces can suddenly start moving in abounded region of space and then return to rest. Such behavior can occur for a weak solution of 2 D Euler. The Navier–Stokes and Euler equations give rise to a number of fundamental problems in addition to the breakdown problem discussed above. We finish this article with one such problem. Suppose that we fix aninitial velocity u0(x)for the 3 D Navier–Stokes or Euler equation. The energy E^0 at time t = 0 is given by E^0 = 12^R^3 |u(x, 0)|^2 dx.

III.24. Expanders

2 The Existence of Expanders

The first person to prove that expanders exist was Pinkser, who proved that ifn \text{is large and} d ⩾ 3, then almost everyan expander. That is, he proved that there is a con-d-regular graph with n vertices is stant$c >$0 such that for every fixed$d ⩾ 3$, \text{the pro}- portion ofnot expanders tends to zero asd-regular graphs with nntends to infinity.vertices that are This proof was an early example of the probabilistic methodsee that if a[IV.19 §3](/part-04/extremal-and-probabilistic-combinatorics) in combinatorics. It is not hard tod-regular graph is chosen uniformly at ran- dom, then the S is d|S|(n − |expected S|)/n, which is at least number of edges leaving a set(1 d)|S|. Stan- dard “tail estimates” are then used to prove that, forany fixed S, the probability that the number of edges2 leaving value is extremely small: so small that if we add up the Sis significantly different from its expected probabilities for all sets, then even the sum is small.So with high probability all sets S have at least c|S| edges to their complement. (In one respect this descrip-tion is misleading: it is not a straightforward matter to discuss probabilities of events concerning random ddently chosen. However, Bollobás has defined an equiv--regular graphs because the edges are not in de pen a le nt model for random regular graphs that allows them to be handled.)Note that this proof does not give us an explicit description of any expander: it merely proves thatthey exist in abundance. This is a drawback to the proof, because, as we shall see later, there are applications for expanders that depend on some kind ofexplicit description, or at least on an efficient method of producing expanders. But what exactly is an “explicit description” or an “efficient method”? There are many possible answers to this question, of which we shall discuss two. The first is to demand that there is an algorithm that can list, for any integer edges of ad-regular c-expander with aroundn, all the vertices andn vertices (we could be flexible about this and ask for the num-ber of vertices to be between$n and n^{2}$, say) in a time that is polynomial inity [IV.20 §2](/part-04/computational-complexity) for a discussion of polynomial-time algo-n. (See computational complex- rithms.) Descriptions of this kind are sometimes called “mildly explicit.” the following graph. Its vertices are all 01 sequencesof length To get an idea of what is “mild” about this, considerk, and two such sequences are joined by an edge if they differ in exactly one place. This graph issometimes called the discrete cube ink dimensions. It 197 has 2 k vertices, so the time taken to list all the ver- tices and edges will be huge compared withever, for many purposes we do not actually need suchk. How- a list: what matters is that there is a concise way of representing each vertex, and an efficient algorithm for listing the (representations of the) neighbors of any given vertex.

Graphs that can be efficiently a vertex takes a time that is polynomial in the logarithm explicit of the number of vertices) are called. strongly The quest for explicitly constructed expanders has been the source of some beautiful mathematics, whichhas often used ideas from fields such as number theory and algebra. The first explicit expander was discovered by Margulis. We give his construction and another one; we stress that although these constructions are very simple to describe, it is rather less easy to prove thatthey really are expanders. for every integer Z Margulis’s construction gives an 8-regular graphis the set of all integers modm. The vertex set ism.

However, we shall now describe a closely related property that can be checked in polynomial time, and which is in some ways more natural. A Given a graphis the n \times  n matrix where G with n vertices, its Auvis defined to be 1 ifadjacency matrix uand symmetric, and therefore hasis joined to v and 0 otherwise. This matrix is realn real eigenvalues [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)thatλ ⩾λ1λ, λ2⩾, . . . , λ· · ·n⩾, which we name in such a wayλ . Moreover, eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.1 2$n$ of useful information aboutthis, let us briefly consider how It turns out that these eigenvalues encode a great deal G. But before we come to A acts as a linear map. If we are given a function G, then Af is the function whose value atf, defined on the vertices ofu is the sum of immediately that iff (v) over all neighbors G is d-regular andv of u. From this we seef is the function that is 1 at every vertex, thend at every vertex. In other words, a constant function Af is the function that is is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue d. It is also not hard to see that this is the largest possible eigenvalue$λ^{1}$, and that if the graph is connected, then the second largest eigenvalueλ2 will be strictly less than d. ity properties of the graph is considerably deeper than In fact, the relationship between$λ2 \text{and connectiv}-$ this: roughly speaking, the further awaythe bigger the expansion parameterc of the graph.λ2 is from d, More precisely, it can be shown that1(d - λ ) and 2 d(d - λ ). From this it follows thatc lies between an infinite family ofexpanders if and only if there is some constant2 2 d-regular graphs is a family of2 a > 0 such that the spectral gapsd - λ2 \text{are at least a for} every graph in the family. One of the many reasons these bounds onc are important is that although, as we have remarked, it is hard to test whether a graph is acomputed in polynomial time. So we can at least obtainc-expander, its second largest eigenvalue can be estimates for how good the expansion properties of agraph are. Another important parameter of ad-regular graph Gfromis the largest absolute value of any eigenvalue apartλ1; this parameter is denoted byλ(G). If λ(G) is

If G were random, a small calcu- lation shows that we would expect the numberof edges from A to B to be about d|A| |B|/n. It can be E(A, B) shown that, for any two disjoint sets in anyd-regular graphby at most G, E(A, B)λ(G)will differ from this expected amount|A| |B|. Therefore, if λ(G) is a small fraction ofd, then between any two reasonably large setswe expect. This shows that graphs for which A and B we get roughly the number of edges thatλ(G) is small “behave like random graphs.” regular graphs.

What we are doing with these kinds of arguments is solving awhere the unknown is a function. So that we can see this functional equation, that is, an equation more clearly, let us write$f (t) for 2t$. The information we are given is the fundamental propertyf (t)f (u) together with one value, f (1) = f (t2, to get us+ u) = started. From this we wish to deduce as much as we canaboutf . we have placed on It is a nice exercise to show that the two conditionsf determine the value of f at every rational number, at least iftive. For instance, to show thatf is assumed to be posi-f (0) should be 1, we note that$f (0)f (1) = f (\sqrt{1})$, and we have already shown that similar spirit to these arguments, and the conclusionf (3/2) must be 8. The rest of the proof is in a is thatf (p/q) must be the qth root of 2 p. More gener- ally, the only sensible definition ofof$a^{p}$. ap/q is the qth root functional equation, but we have made sense of We have now extracted everything we can from the$a^{t} only$ iftion whentis a rational number. Can we give a sensible defini-$t$is irrational? For example, what would be the most natural definition of 2 equation alone does not determine what 2$\sqrt^{2}$? Since the functional\sqrt2 should be, the way to answer a question like this is to look for some natural additional property thatthat would, together with the functional equation, spec-f might have ifyf uniquely. It turns out that there are two obvious choices, both of which work. The first is thatbe an increasing function: that is, ifs is less thanf shouldt, then

The exponential function \exp most basic way to think of it, though for most purposes(x)very definitely has this property. Perhaps the not the best, is that exp(x) = ex, where e \text{is a number whose decimal expansion begins} 2 \text{we focus on this number}? \text{One property that singles it}.7182818. \text{Why do} \text{out is that if we differentiate the function expthen we obtain} e xagain—and e is the only number for$(x) = e^{x}$, which that is true. Indeed, this leads to a second way ofdefining the exponential function: it is the only solution of the differential equationf^ (x) = f (x)that satisfies the initial conditionf (0) = 1. chosen in textbooks, is as the limit of a power series: A third way to define exp(x), \text{and one that is often}\exp (x) = 1 + x + x2!2$+ x3!3$+ · · ·, known as the Taylor series of exp(x). It is not immedi- ately obvious that the right-hand side of this definition gives us some number raised to the powerx, which is why we are using the notation expex. However, with a bit of work one can verify that it(x) rather than yields the basic properties exp$(x + y) = \exp (x) \exp (y)$,\exp (0) = 1$, and (d/dx) \exp (x) = \exp (x)$. There is yet another way to define the exponential function, and this one comes much closer to telling uswhat it really means. Suppose you wish to invest some money for ten years and are given the following choice: either you can add 100% to your investment (that is, double it) at the end of the ten years, or each year you can take whatever you have and increase it by 10%.Which would you prefer?

III.25. The Exponential and Logarithmic Functions The second is the better investment because in the second case the interest isyou start with 100, then after a year you will have 110 compounded: for instance, if and after two years you will have $121$. \text{The increase of}11 in the second year breaks down as 10% interest on the original 100 plus a further dollar, which is 10% interest on the interest earned in the first year. Underthe second scheme, the amount of money you end up with is $100 timesby 1$.1. The approximate value of(1.1)10, since each year it multiplies(1.1)10 is 2.5937, so you will get almost $260 \text{instead of}$200. Instead of multiplying your investment by 1 times, you would multiply it by 1 What if you compounded your interest monthly?1 120 times. By the101 ten end of ten years your 100 would have been multiplied by(1 +1 )120, which is approximately 2120 .707. If you compounded it daily, you could increase this to approx-120 imately 2.718, which is suspiciously close to e. In fact, e can be defined as the limit, asthe number$(1 +^{1} )^{n}$. ntends to infinity, of does tend to a limit. For any fixed powerof It is not instantly obvious that this expression really$(1 + 1 )m \text{as nn}$ tends to infinity is 1, while for anym, the limit fixed comes to$n$, \text{the limit asn} (1 + 1 )n, the increase in the power just com-mtends to infinity is\infty . When it pensates for the decrease in the number 1 get a limit between 2 and 3. Ifn x is any real number, then+1 n and we(to be exp1 +x n)n (x)also converges to a limit, and this we define. Here is a sketch of an argument that shows that if we define exp property that we need if our definition is to be a good(x) in this way, then we obtain the main one, namely exp$(x) \exp (y) = \exp (x + y)$. Let us take$1$+ nx^n 1 + yn^n,$\text{which equals} 1$+ xn + yn + xyn^2^n. \text{Now the ratio of} 1 y/n is smaller than 1+ x/n+ xy/n+ y/n^2, and+ xy/n(1 +^2 xy/nto 1 +^2 x/n)^n can+ be shown to converge to 1 (as here the increase inis not enough to compensate for the rapid decrease in$nxy/n^{2})$. Therefore, for large n the number we have is$\text{very close to} 1$+ x +n y^n. Lettingntend to infinity, we deduce the result.

3 Extending the Definition to Complex Numbers

If we think of exp(x) as ex, then the idea of generalizing the definition to complex numbers seems hopeless: our intuition tells us nothing, the functional equation does not help, and we cannot use continuity or order rela-tions to determine it for us. However, both the power series and the compound-interest definitions can be generalized easily. Ifz is a complex number, then the most usual definition of exp(z) is$1$+ z + z2!2$+ z$3!3$+ · · ·$.$Settingz = iθ$, for a real number θ, and splitting the resulting expression into its real and imaginary parts, we obtain 1- θ2!2$+ θ$4!4$+ · · · + i θ - θ$3!3$+ θ$5!5− · · · , which, using the power-series expansions for cosand sin(θ), tells us that exp(iθ) = \cos (θ) + i sin(θ)(θ), the formula for the point with argumentθ on the unit circle in the complex plane. In particular, if we takeθ = π, we obtain the famous formula (ei)π = −1 (since\cos (π) = −1 and sin(π) = 0).

This formula is so striking that one feels that it ought to hold for a good reason, rather than being a merefact that one notices after carrying out some formal algebraic manipulations. And indeed there is a good reason. To see it, let us return to the compound-interest idea and define exp(z) to be the limit of (1 + z/n)n as nw here tends to infinity. Let us concentrate just on the casez = iπ: why should(1 + iπ/n)n \text{be close to} - 1 when To answer this, let us think geometrically. What is$n$is very large? the effect on a complex number of multiplying it by1$+ iπ/n$? On the Argand diagram this number is very close to 1 and vertically above it. Because the vertical line through 1 is tangent to the circle, this means that the number is very close indeed to a number that lies on the circle and has argumentof a number on the circle is the length of the circular$π/n (\text{since the argument}$ arc from 1 to that number, and in this case the circular arc is almost straight). Therefore, \text{\text{\text{\text{multiplication}}} by} 1+iπ/n is very well approximated by rotation through an angle ofπ, which is the same as multiplication byπ/n. Doing this n times results in a rotation by-1. The same argument can be used to justify the formula exp\cos (θ) + \text{i sin}(θ). (iθ) = of the exponential function is the exponential function.Continuing in this vein, let us see why the derivative

202

We know already that exp(z + w) = \exp (z) \exp (w), so the derivative of exp atzero of exp(z)(\exp (w) -z1)/wis the limit as. It is therefore enoughw tends to to show that exp(w) - 1 is very close to w when w is small. To get a good idea of expa large n \text{and consider} (1 + w/n)(w)n. \text{It is not hard towe should take prove that this is indeed close to} 1 + w, \text{but here is an} \text{informal argument instead}. \text{Suppose that you have abank account that offers a tiny rate of interest over a year}, say 0 \text{could compound this interest monthly}? \text{The answer is}.5%. \text{How much better would you do if you not very much}: \text{if the total amount of interest is verysmall}, \text{then the interest on the interest is negligible}. This, \text{in essence}, \text{is why}1 + w when w \text{is small}. (1 + w/n)n \text{is approximately function yet further}. \text{The main ingredients one needsare addition}, \text{multiplication}, \text{and the possibility of lim}-\text{One can extend the definition of the exponential iting arguments}.

One con-vention is to writez = r eiθ with r > 0 and 0 ⩽ θ < 2π, which can be done in exactly one way, and\log (z) to be log(r ) + iθ. However, this function is not then define continuous: as you cross the positive real axis, the argument jumps by 2π and the logarithm jumps by$2$πRemarkably, this difficulty, far from being a blowi. to mathematics, is an entirely positive phenomenon that lies behind several remarkable theorems in complex analysis, such as Cauchy’s residue theorem, which allows one to evaluate very general path integrals. III.26 The Fast Fourier Transform If$f$: R\to  R is a periodic function with period 1, then one can obtain a great deal of useful information about$f$by calculating its Fourier coefficients (see the fourier transform This is true for both theoretical and practical reasons,[III.27](/part-03/the-fourier-transform) for a discussion of why). and because of the latter it is highly desirable to havea good way of computing Fourier coefficients quickly. A method for doing this was discovered by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 (though it turned out that Gauss had anticipated them over 150 years earlier).

If we do not have an explicit formula for the integral(as would be the case, for instance, iff were derived from some physical signal rather than a mathematical formula), then we will want to approximate this integral numerically, and a natural way to do that is to$-discretiz(e^{1}()^{N})^{-1}$ it: that is, turn it into a sum of the form-2 π i r n/NNlating andn=0 f (n/N)r is not too big, then this should be a goode . If f is not too wildly oscil- approximation. The sum above will be unchanged if we add a multiple ofoff at points of the form N to r , so we now care only about the valuesn/N. Moreover, the period- icity off tells us that adding a multiple of N to n also makes no difference. So we can regard both belonging to the group Z of integers mod Nn(seeandmod-r as ular arithmetic to one that reflects this. Given a function[III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic)). Let us change our notation N gdefined on Zthe function ˆNwe define theg, also defined ondiscrete Fourier transform Z , which is given byofg to be N

The fast Fouriern). Therefore it can be calculated using transform arises from the observation that the sum in (1) has symmetry properties that allow it to be calcu-lated much more efficiently. This is most easily seen whenshall look at the case N is a power of 2, and to make it even easier we N = 8. The sums to be evaluated are then g(0) + ω-r g(1) + ω-2 r g(2) + · · · + ω-7 rg(7) \text{for each}r between 0 and 7. Now a sum like this can be rewritten as g(0) + ω-2 rg(2) + ω-4 r g(4) + ω-6 rg(6)+ ω-r (g(1) + ω-2 rg(3) + ω-4 r g(5) + ω-6 r g(7)), 203 \text{which is interesting because}$g(0) + ω-2 r g(2) + ω-4 r g(4) + ω-6 r g(6) and$ g(1) + ω-2 r g(3) + ω-4 r g(5) + ω-6 r g(7) \text{are themselves values of discrete Fourier transforms}.\text{For instance}$, \text{if we set}$ h(n) = g(2 n) for 0 ⩽ n ⩽ 3, and write equals$h(0ψ) +forψ^{-}ω^{r}^{2}h(=1)e^{2}+^{π}ψ^{i}^{/}^{4}^{-}$, then the first expression2$r h(2) + ψ^{-3}^{r}h(3)$. If we think ofthe formula for ˆhas being defined onh(r )$. Z^{4}$, then this is precisely A similar remark applies to the second expression, so if we can calculate the discrete Fourier transforms of the “even part” of$g$and the “odd part” ofg, then it will be very straightforward to obtain each value of the Fourier transform ofgitself: it will be a linear combination of values of the transforms of the two parts ofg. Thus, if N is even and we write F(N) for the number of operations needed to calculate the discrete fourier transform of a function defined on Z , we obtain a

$N$

recurrence of the form

$F(N) = 2F(N/2) + CN$.

The interpretation of this is that in order to work outthe N values of the transform of a function on Z , it is enough to work out two such transforms for functionson Z and work out N \text{linear combinations}, \text{each of}N which takes a constant number of steps.If NN/\text{is a power of} 2, \text{then we can iterate this}:2 F(N/2) \text{will be at most} 2 F(N/4) + CN/2, \text{and so on}. \text{It is not hard to show as a result thatfor some constant} C, \text{a considerable improvement on} F(N) \text{is at most CN} \log NCN}2.

and odd functions? A useful way to regard them is asfollows. We have a group of two transformations of the What are the symmetry properties enjoyed by even real line: one is the identity mapι:$x \to x \text{and the}$ other is the reflectionρ: x → −x. Now any transfor- mationtion of the functions defined on the real line: given aφ of the real line gives rise to a transforma- functiong(x) = f (φ(x))f , the transformed function is the function. In the case at hand, if φ = ι then the transformed function is justit isf (-x). If f is either even or odd, then both thef (x)$, \text{while if} φ = ρ then$ transformed functions areinal functionf . In particular, when scalar multiplesφ = ρ, the trans-of the orig- formed function ismultiple is 1) and-f (x)f (x)whenwhenff is even (so the scalaris odd (so the scalar multiple is-1). a very simple prototype of the general notion of a The procedure just described can be thought of as Fourier transform. Very broadly speaking, a fourier transform is a systematic way to decompose “generic” functions into a superposition of “symmetric” func-tions. These symmetric functions are usually quite explicitly defined: for instance, one of the most important examples is a decomposition into themetric functions [III.92](/part-03/trigonometric-functions) sin(nx) and cos(nx)trigono-. They are also often related to physical concepts such as fre-quency or energy. The symmetry will usually be associated with a group [I.3 §2.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions)G, which is usually Abe- lian. (In the case considered above, it is the two-element group.) Indeed, the Fourier transform is a fundamental tool in the study of groups, and more precisely in the representation theory [IV.9](/part-04/representation-theory) of groups, which concerns different ways in which a group can be regarded as a group of symmetries. It is also related to topics inlinear algebra, such as the representation of a vector as linear combinations of anor as linear combinations of orthonormal basis eigenvectors [I.3 §4.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of[III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis), a matrix or linear operator [III.50](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties). integer posing functions from For a more complicated example, let us fix a positive$n$and let us define a systematic way of decom-C to C, that is, complex-valued functions defined on the complex plane.

This formula can be thought of as the limiting case\infty  of the previous decomposition, restricted to the unitn \to circle. It can also be regarded as a generalization of the Taylor series expansion of a holomorphic function [I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions).

In general, there are very strong links between fourier analysis and complex analysis. zero very quickly and it is easy to show that the fourier series Iffis smooth, then its Fourier coefficients decay to$\i\text{nf ty} f (n)z$ˆn converges. The issue becomes more subtle ifmerely continuous).

But there is a second group that isimportant here as well, namely the additive group Z of all integers. If we take two of our basic symmetric func-tions,$z^{m} and z^{n}$, and multiply them together, then we obtain the function$zm^{+}n$, so the map n \to  zn is an iso- morphism from multiplication. The group Z to the set of all these functions under Z is known as the Pontryagin dual of T. related areas of harmonic analysis, the most important Fourier transform is defined on the Euclidean space In the theory of partial differential equations and in Rd . Among all functionsbe “basic” are the plane waves$f$: R$d \to Cf (x)$, the ones considered to= c e^2^π^i^x^·^ξ, whereξξ \in  R^d is a vector (known as the frequency of the plane wave), x · ξ is the dot product between the positionx and the frequency ξ, and c is a complex numberξ

Moreover, the value taken byξ, and on each such set the\lambda f This explains the name “plane waves.” It turns out thaton H\lambda is always equal to the value taken on (Hλ()+2){π}. if a function rapidly decreasing as$f$is sufficiently “nice” (e.g., smooth andx gets large), then it can be rep- resented uniquely as the superposition of plane waves, where a “superposition” is now interpreted as an integral rather than a summation. More precisely, we havethe formulas1 f (x) =R d f (ξ)$ˆ e2$πi x · ξ dξ, ferently, \text{with factors such as} 2 places. \text{These notational differences have some minor benefits and}1. \text{In some texts}, \text{the Fourier transform is defined slightly dif}-π and - 1 \text{being moved to other drawbacks}, \text{but they are all equivalent to each other}$. 206 where f (ξ)ˆ$=R d f (x)(e-2()π){i}x · ξ dx.

These two formulas show how to original function and vice versa. One can view the quan-tity ˆf (ξ) as the extent to which the function f contains a component that oscillates at frequencyξ. As it turns out, there is no difficulty in justifying the convergence of these integrals whenfis sufficiently nice, though the issue again becomes more subtle for functions thatare somewhat rough or slowly decaying. In this case, the underlying group is the Euclidean group Rd (which can also be thought of as the group of translations); note that both the position variabled-dimension alx and the frequency variable also the Pontryagin dual group in this setting.$ξ \text{are contained in} R^{d}$, so2 Rd is understanding various linear operations on functions, such as, for instance, the Laplacian on One major application of the Fourier transform lies in Rd. Given a func- tion$f$: Rd \to  C, its Laplacian Δfis defined by the formula

That is, the effect of the Laplacian on the plane wavee2πi x · ξ is to multiply it by the scalar -4π2|ξ|2. In other words, the plane wave is an eigenfunction the Laplacian\Delta, \text{with eigenvalue} - 4π2|ξ|2. (More gen-3 for erally, plane waves will be eigenfunctions for any lin-ear operation that commutes with translations.) Therefore, the Laplacian, when viewed through the lens of the not want to use this dot product, the Pontryagin dual would insteadbe2. This is because of our reliance on the dot product; if one did(R d)*, the dual vector space t(o R)d. But this subtlety is not too important in most applications.3. Strictly speaking, this is a generalized eigenfunction, as plane waves are not square-integrable on Rd.

III. Mathematical Concepts

Fourier transform, is very simple: the Fourier transform lets one write an arbitrary function as a superposition of plane waves, and the Laplacian has a very simple effect on each plane wave. To be explicit about it,\Delta f (x) = \Delt(a R)d f (ξ)$ˆ e2$πi x · ξ dξ=R d f (ξ)ˆ$\Delta(e^{2}()^{π})^{{}i}^{x}^{·}^{ξ} dξ=^{R}^{d}(-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2})f (ξ)$ˆ e2$π^{i}^{x}^{·}^{ξ} dξ$,

which gives us a formula for the Laplacian of a gen-eral function. Here we have interchanged the Laplacian Δwith an integral; this can be rigorously justified for suitably nice This formula representsf , but we omit the details.Δf as a superposition of plane waves. But any such representation is unique, and the Fourier inversion formula tells us that

$\Delta f (x) =^{R}^{d} \Delta f (ξ)(e^{2}()^{π})^{{}i}^{x}^{·}^{ξ} dξ$.

Therefore,

$\Delta f (ξ) = (-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2})f (ξ)$,ˆ

a fact that can also be derived directly from the definition of the Fourier transform using integration byparts. This identity shows that the Fourier transform diagonalizes Laplacian, when viewed using the Fourier transform, isthe Laplacian: the operation of taking the nothing more than multiplication of a function the multiplier$-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2}$. The quantity -4π2|ξ|2 F(ξ)can beby interpreted as the energy level associated4 with the frequencyas a Fourier multiplierξ. In other words, the Laplacian can be viewed, meaning that to calculate the Laplacian you take the Fourier transform, multiply bythe multiplier, and then take the inverse Fourier transform again. This viewpoint allows one to manipulate the Laplacian very easily. For instance, we can iterate the above formula to compute higher powers of the Laplacian: $\Delta^{n}f (ξ) = (-4π^{2}|ξ|^{2})^{n}f (ξ)$ˆ for$n = 0$, 1, 2, . . . . Indeed, we are now in a position to develop more gen-eral functions of the Laplacian. For instance, we can take a square root as follows: $-\Delta f (ξ) = 2π|ξ|f (ξ)$.ˆ This leads to the theory of fractional differential oper-ators (which are in turn a special case of pseudo differential operators), as well as the more general theory to make the energies positive.4. When taking this view, it is customary to replaceΔ by -Δ in order

III.27. The Fourier Transform

ofstarts with a given operator (such as the Laplacian) and functional calculus [IV.15 §3.1](/part-04/operator-algebras), in which one then studies various functions of that operator, suchas square roots, exponentials, inverses, and so forth. As the above discussion shows, the Fourier transform can be used to develop a number of interesting oper-ations, which have particular importance in the theory of differential equations. To analyze these operations effectively, one needs various estimates on the Fourier transform. For instance, it is often important to knowhow the size of a functionf , as measured by some norm, relates to the size of its Fourier transform, asmeasured by a possibly different norm. For a further discussion of this point, see function spaces [III.29](/part-03/function-spaces). One particularly important and striking estimate of thistype is the Plancherel identity, which shows that the actually equal Rd to the|f (x)|L2 L2 d-norm of a Fourier transform is-norm of the original function.x =R d |f (ξ)ˆ|2 dξ, The Fourier transform is therefore a unitary operation, so one can view the frequency-space representation of2 a function as being in some sense a “rotation” of the physical-space representation. transform and associated operators is a major compo-nent of harmonic analysis. A variant of the Plancherel Developing further estimates related to the Fourier identity is the convolution formula: This formula allows one to analyze the R d f (y)g(x - y) dy =R d f (ξ)ˆg(ξ)$ˆ convolutione2$πi x^·^ξ dξ.f^* g(x) =R d f (y)g(x - y) dy

of two functions forms; in particular, if the Fourier coefficients off and g in terms of their Fourier trans-f org are small, then we expect the convolution f* g to be small as well. This relationship means that the fourier transform controls certain correlations of a function with itself and with other functions, which makes the Fourier transform an important tool in understanding the randomness and uniform distribution proper-ties of various objects in probability theory, harmonic analysis, and number theory. For instance, one can pur-sue the above ideas to establish the central limit theorem, which asserts that the sum of many independent random variables will eventually resemble a gaussian distribution ods to establish[III.71 §5](/part-03/probability-distributions); one can even use such meth-vinogradov’s theorem [V.27](/part-05/problems-and-results-in-vi36-peter-gustav-lejeune-dirichlet-18051859), \text{that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes}. 207 \text{above set of ideas}. \text{For instance}, \text{one can replace the Laplacian by a more general operator and the plane There are many directions in which to generalize the waves by} (generalized) \text{eigenfunctions} \text{of that operator}. \text{This leads to the subject ofand functional calculus}; \text{one can also study the alge}-\text{spectral theory} [III.86](/part - 03/the - spectrum) \text{bra of Fourier multipliers} (\text{and of convolution}) \text{more abstractly}, \text{which leads to the theory of}$C*$[IV.15 §3](/part - 04/operator - algebras). \text{One can also go beyond the theory of lin}-\text{ear operators and study bilinear}, multilinear, \text{or even}-\text{algebras fully nonlinear operators}. \text{This leads in particular tothe theory of paraproducts}, \text{which are} \text{generalizations} \text{of the pointwise product operation}(f (x), g(x)) \tof g(x)\text{In another direction}, \text{one can replace Euclidean spacethat are of importance in differential equations}. \text{Rd by a more general group}, \text{in which case the notion of a plane wave is replaced by the notion of aacter} (\text{if the group is Abelian}) \text{or a} \text{representation} char-(\text{if the group is non} - Abelian). \text{There are other variants ofthe Fourier transform}, \text{such as the Laplace transform or the Mellin transform} (\text{for more about other trans} - forms, \text{see the article transforms} [III.91](/part - 03/transforms)), \text{which are very similar algebraically to the Fourier transform and play similar roles} (\text{for instance}, \text{the Laplace transform isalso useful in analyzing differential equations}). \text{We have already seen that Fourier transforms are connected to Taylor series}; \text{there is also a connection to some other important series expansions}, \text{notably Dirichlet series}, \text{as well as expansions of functions in terms of polynomials} [III.85](/part - 03/special - functions) \text{such as orthogonal polynomials special or The Fourier transform decomposes a function ex}-\text{spherical harmonics} [III.87](/part - 03/spherical - harmonics). \text{actly into many components}, \text{each of which has a precise frequency}. \text{In some applications it is more usefulto adopt a} “fuzzier” approach, \text{in which a function is decomposed into fewer components but each compo}-\text{nent has a range of frequencies rather than consisting purely of a single frequency}.

classical and quantum physics, which can be studied rigorously using the methods of geometric quantization and microlocal analysis. III.28 Fuchsian Groups

One of the most basic objects in geometry is thea surface that has the shape of the surface of a bagel.torus: If you want to construct one, you can do so by tak-ing a square and gluing opposite edges together. When you glue the top and bottom edges together you havea cylinder, and when you glue the other two edges together, which have now become circles, you obtain your torus. A more mathematical way of making a torus is as follows. We start with the usualand the square in it with vertices at(x$, y)(0\text{coordinate plane}$, 0), (1, 0), (1,1),$\text{andates satisfy} 0$(0, 1), which consists of the points whose coordin-⩽ x ⩽ 1, 0 ⩽ y ⩽ 1. This square can be moved around horizontally and vertically. If we shift itm units horizontally and n units vertically, where m andthe points whose coordinates satisfyn are integers, we get the square that consists ofm ⩽ x ⩽ m + 1, n ⩽ y ⩽ n+1. As m and n run through all the integers, we see that the copies of the square cover the whole plane, with four squares coming together at each point with integer coordinates. The plane is said to beor tessellated (from the Latin word for a marble chip intiled a mosaic), and it is easy to see that you can color the squares alternately black and white and get an infinite checkerboard pattern.To make the torus we “identify” points. We say that the points point in a certain new figure if(x, y) and (x^ , y^ ) correspond to the samex - x^  and y - y^  are both integers. To see what the new figure looks like, we observe that any point in the plane corresponds to a point inside, or on the edge of, our original square.Moreover, the point(x, y) corresponds to exactly one point inside the square provided that neitheris an integer. So our new space looks a lot like our origi-x nor y nal square. But what about the points They correspond to the same point in our new space, as(1 4,0) and (1 4, 1)? \text{do any corresponding pairs of points on the upper andlower edges of our square}. \text{So those edges are identified in our new space}. \text{By a similar argument}, \text{so too are the left and right edges}. \text{The result is that}, \text{after points are identified according to our rule}, \text{we obtain the torus}. \text{figures on it just by drawing them in the original square}; \text{If we make the torus in this way}, \text{we can draw small III}. \text{Mathematical Concepts lengths in the square will then correspond exactly tolengths on the torus}. \text{This is how old}-\text{fashioned printing on a drum works}: \text{an inked figure on a cylinder isrolled over the paper to make exact copies of the figure}. Thus, \text{as far as small figures are concerned}, \text{the geom}-\text{etry of the torus is exactly like Euclidean geometry}. \text{In mathematical language we say that the geometry on thetorus is induced from the geometry on the plane}, \text{and therefore that it isit is different}, \text{because one can draw curves on the torus locally Euclidean}.

To create these in a similar way, wen-holed torus (the surfaces of need Fuchsian groups. It is natural to expect that we can get other surfaces by using polygons with more than four sides. Itturns out that if you use a polygon with eight sides, for example a regular octagon, and glue sides 1 and 3 together, 2 and 4 together, 5 and 7 together, and 6 and 8 together, you get the two-holed torus. How can we usea group to achieve the same result, as we did with the torus? For that we need a way of fitting lots of copies of the octagon together so that they overlap only along edges. The problem is that one cannot tile the plane with octagons: the angles of an octagon are 135◦, and that is far too big because we need eight octagons to fit together at each vertex. The way forward here is to use hyperbolic geometry can also work with our bare hands. Take the unit disk[I.3 §6.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) instead of Euclidean geometry. But we in the complex plane, D$= {z}$:$|z| ⩽ 1$. Take the group of what are calledare maps of the form$z$Möbius transformations$\to (az + b)/(cz + d)$. It is a, which routine calculation to show that these maps send circles and straight lines to circles and straight lines (theymix the two types up, sometimes sending a circle to a straight line and vice versa) and that they map anglesto equal angles, just like the more familiar Euclidean rotations. If we now select just those Möbius transfor-mations that map D to itself, then we have a group that

III.28. Fuchsian Groups

we shall callgroup.G. Indeed, we very nearly have a Fuchsian the square played in the Euclidean plane. Our group$G$We need to find a shape that will play the role thathas the property that it maps diameters of D and arcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary ofdiameters of D and arcs of circles perpendicular to D to the boundary of D, so we let these play the role of straight lines and use eight of them as the edges ofa (non-Euclidean) octagon. We find that we can do this in many ways, so we pick one with the highest degreeof symmetry to make things easy for ourselves. That is, we draw a “regular octagon” centered on the centerof the disk D. This still leaves us with some choice: the bigger the octagon, the smaller its angles. So we drawthe octagon with angles ofπ/4, \text{which allows eight of} them to cluster at each vertex, and then we can fit them together as we want. If we identify points that lie in corresponding places in different copies of the polygon, then the resulting space is a riemann surface [III.79](/part-03/riemann-surfaces) of genus 2.A Fuchsian group is a subgroup of the group$G$ (of Möbius transformations that map D to itself) that moves some polygon around “en bloc” and thereby tilesthe disk. Just as with the torus, we have a notion of equivalent points (ones that are in the corresponding place in different tiles) and when we identify equivalent points we get the space that we would also have obtained by identifying the edges of the polygon in pairs, which is the space we wanted.All this can be described in the language of hyperbolic geometry. Thea riemannian metric disk model[I.3 §6.10](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) onis defined by means of D, the differential of which is given by d$s = 1|− |dz|z|^{2}$. The elements of Gmove figures around in D in a way that preserves hyperbolic distances. It follows that the geometry on the surface that we obtain by identifying points in the manner just described is locally hyperbolic It turns out that if we carry out the above construc-, just as that of the torus was locally Euclidean. tion starting with a regular 4 then we obtain a Riemann surface of genus$n$-sided figure (with$n$. \text{But math} - n > 2), ematicians can do much more. If you go back to theplane and start not with a square but with a rectangle, or still more generally a parallelogram, it is rea-sonably easy to see that the same construction can be carried out. Indeed, if you just watch the original con-struction from an appropriate angle, instead of from

209

vertically above the plane, then the square will turn intoany parallelogram you choose (possibly enlarged or contracted). When you use a parallelogram, you again obtain a torus, but it differs from the original one in thesame way that the square and the parallelogram differ: angles are distorted. It is a not entirely trivial exerciseto show that the only angle-preserving maps from one parallelogram to another are similarities (uniform scaling by the same amount in two, and therefore all, direc-tions). So the resulting tori have a different sense of what angles are: that is, they have different structures. conformal The same happens in the hyperbolic disk. If one picks a 4 whose edges come in pairs of equal length, and onen-sided polygon (its sides are parts of geodesics) finds a group that moves this polygon around en blocand matches the edges exactly, then a Riemann surface is once again obtained, but if the polygons are not conformally equivalent, then neither are the cor-responding surfaces; they have the same genus, n, but different conformal structures. We can even go further and allow some of the vertices of the polygon to lie on the boundary of the disk, in which case the corresponding sides of the polygon are infinitely long with respect to the hyperbolic metric. The space we then construct is a “punctured” Riemann surface, and again mathematicians can vary its conformal structure. The fundamental importance of Fuchsian groups derives from thethat all but the simplest Riemann surfaces arise from uniformization theorem, which says some Fuchsian group in the fashion described above.This includes every Riemann surface of genus greater than 1, and those of genus 1 with at least one puncture, with any possible conformal structure.The name Fuchsian group was given to these groups bythe course of work on the hypergeometric equation andpoincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) in 1881, who discovered them in related differential equations, which had been inspired by the work of the German mathematician Lazarus Fuchs. klein [VI.57] protested to him that a better procedure might have been to name them after Schwarz, and Poincaré was willing to agree once he read the relevant paper by Schwarz, but by then Fuchs had given his approval to the name. When Klein protested too much(in Poincaré’s view), Poincaré \text{publicly gave the name Kleinian groups arise in the study of conformal} \text{transformations} \text{of theto the analogous class of groups that three}-\text{dimensional unit ball}. \text{The names have stuck ever since}, \text{but the study of Kleinian groups is much more difficult and neither Poincar}é \text{nor Klein could do much} 210 \text{with the concept}.

When one works with real or complex numbers, thereis a natural notion of the magnitude of a numberx, namely its modulusof magnitude to define a distance|x|. One can also use this notion|x - y| between two numbers which pairs of numbers are close and which ones arex and y and thereby say in a quantitative way far apart. when one deals with objects with more degrees offreedom. Consider for instance the problem of deter-The situation becomes more complicated, however, mining the “magnitude” of a three-dimensional rect-angular box. There are several candidates for such a magnitude: length, width, height, volume, surface area, diameter (the length of a long diagonal), eccentricity, and so forth. Unfortunately, these magnitudes donot give equivalent comparisons: for example, box A may be longer and have a greater volume than box B, but box B may be wider and have a greater surface area. Because of this, one abandons the idea that there should be only one notion of “magnitude” for boxes, and instead accepts that there is a multiplicity of such notions and that they can all be useful: for some appli-cations one may wish to distinguish the large-volume boxes from the small-volume boxes, while in others onemay wish to distinguish the eccentric boxes from the round boxes. Of course, there are several relationships between the different notions of magnitude (e.g., the isoperimetric inequality an upper limit on the possible volume if one knows the[IV.26] allows one to place surface area), so the situation is not as disorganized asit may at first appear.

and range. (A good case to have in mind is functions$f$ Now let us turn to functions with a fixed domain:[-1,1] \to  R from the interval [-1, 1] to the real line R.) These objects have infinitely many degrees of freedom, so it should not be surprising that there are now infinitely many distinct notions of “magnitude,” which all provide different answers to the question “how large is a given function tion “how close together are two functions$f$?” (or to the closely related ques-f and g?”). In some cases, certain functions may have infinite mag-nitude by one measure and finite magnitude by another (similarly, a pair of functions may be very close by one measure and very far apart by another). Again, this situation may seem chaotic, but it simply reflects thefact that functions have many distinct characteristics— some are tall, some are broad, some are smooth, someare oscillatory, and so forth—and that, depending on the application at hand, one may need to give more weight to one of these characteristics than to others. In analysis, these characteristics are embodied in a vari-ety of standard function spaces and their associated norms qualitatively and quantitatively., which are available to describe functions both Xdomain and range). A majority (but certainly not all), the elements of which are functions (with some fixed Formally, a function space is a normed space [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces) of the standard function spaces considered in analysis are not just normed spaces but also banach spaces [III.62](/part-03/normed-spaces-and-banach-spaces).

One can similarly definethe space$C^{2}[-1$,1]of twice continuously differentiable functions, and so forth, all the way up to thespace$C \i\text{nf ty} [-1$,1]of infinitely differentiable functions.

We will not discuss these variants here.)

2.3 The Lebesgue Spaces Lp[-1, 1]

The supremum norm simultaneous control on the size off \infty  mentioned earlier gives|f (x)| for all x \in[-1, 1]. However, this means that if there is a tiny set

211

oflarge, even if a typical value ofx for which |f (x)| is very large, then|f (x)| is much smaller.f \infty  is very It is sometimes more advantageous to work with normsthat are less influenced by the values of a function on small sets. The Lp-norm\sum  of a function f isfp =-1 1 |f (x)|p d(x1)/p.

This is defined for 1 The function space L⩽p[p <-1,\infty 1]and for any measurable is the class of measurablef . functions for which the above norm is finite. The normf \infty  of a measurable function f is its essential supre-$mum$|f (x): roughly speaking this means the largest value of| if you ignore sets of measure zero. It turns out to be the limit of the normsity. The space L\infty [-1, 1] consists of those me a sur a bl efp as ptends to infin functionsf for which f \inftyis finite. While the$L \i\text{nfty norm}$ is concerned solely with the “height” of a function, the Lp norms are instead concerned with a combination of the “height” and “width” of a function. LThis space is exceptionally rich in symmetries: there2 Particularly important among these norms is the-norm, since L2[-1, 1] is a hilbert space [III.37](/part-03/bayesian-analysis). \text{is a wide variety of invertible linear maps unitary} \text{transformations} \text{Tdefined on} L2[-1, 1] \text{such that}, \text{that is}, T f2 = f2 \text{for every function} f \in L2[-1, 1].$2$.4 \text{The Sobolev Spaces} Wk, p[-1, 1]

The Lebesgue norms control, to some extent, the heightand width of a function, but say nothing about regularity; there is no reason why a function in Lp should be differentiable or even continuous. To incorporate such information one often turns to the Sobolev norms (f W)k, (p[)-1,1], \text{defined for} 1$⩽ p ⩽ \i\text{nfty and} k ⩾ 0 by(f W)k$, p[ - 1^,1] = j = k 0 ddjx(fj)p. \text{The Sobolev space} Wk, p[-1,1] is the space of functions for which this norm is finite. Thus, a function lies in Wk, p[-1, 1]\text{if it and its firstk derivatives all belong to Lp}[-1, 1]. \text{There is one subtlety}: \text{we do not requiref to beweaker sense ofktimes} \text{differentiable} \text{in the usual sense}, \text{but in the distributions} [III.18](/part - 03/distributions). For instance, the function$f$ (x) = |x|is not differentiable at zero, but it does have a natural weak derivative: the functionf^ (x) which is -1 when x < 0 and +1 when x > 0. This function lies in L\infty [-1,1] (since the set {0} has measure zero, we do not need to specify therefore f \text{lies in} (W1),\infty [-1,1] (which turns out to bef^ (0)), and the space of Lipschitz-continuous functions). We need

212

to consider these generalized differentiable functions because without them the space Wk, p[-1,1] would not be complete.Sobolev norms are particularly natural and useful in the analytical study of partial differential equations and mathematical physics. For instance, the W1\\\{}},\\2 norm \text{can be interpreted as} (\text{the square root of}) an “energy”\text{associated with a function}. 3 \text{Properties of Function Spaces There are many ways in which knowledge of the struc}-\text{ture of function spaces can assist in the study of functions}. \text{For instance}, \text{if one has a good basis for the function space}, \text{so that every function in the space isa} (\text{possibly infinite}) \text{linear combination of basis elements}, \text{and one has some quantitative estimates onhow this linear combination converges to the original function}, \text{then this allows one to represent that function efficiently in terms of a number of coefficients}, \text{and also allows one to approximate that func}-\text{tion by smoother functions}. \text{For instance}, \text{one basic result about} L2[-1, 1] \text{is the Plancherel theorem}, \text{which asserts}, \text{among other things}, \text{that there are numbers}(a )\i\text{nfty such thatnn}=−\inftyf - n=−N N aneπ\text{i nx}2 \to 0 as N → \infty.

This shows that any function in approximated to any desired accuracy in L2[-1, 1]L2\text{can beby a} \text{trigonometric polynomial form}$N a eπ\text{i nx}$. \text{The number}: that is, an expression of thea is the nth Fourier coefficient n=−f (n)Nˆn of f . It is given by the formulanf (n)ˆ$= 12^{-}1 1 f (x)(e^{-})^{π}\text{i nx dx}$. tions eare in fact an One can regard this result as saying that the func-πi nx form a very good basis for orthonormal basis: \text{they have norm} 1 and L2[-1, 1]. (They the inner product of two different ones is always zero.)Another very basic fact about function spaces is that certain function spaces embed into others, sothat a function from one space automatically also belongs to other spaces. Further more, there is oftensome inequality that gives an upper bound for one norm in terms of another. For instance, a function in ahigh-regularity space such as$C1[-1$,1] automatically belongs to a low-regularity space such as$C0[-1$,1], and a function in a high-integrability space such as L\infty [-1, 1] automatically belongs to a low-integrability space such as L1[-1,1]. (This statement is no longer

This result tells us that spaces, which allows one to “trade” reguwith lots of regularity but low integrability can beembedded into spaces with low regularity but high integrability. A sample estimate of this type is

which tells us that if the integrals of$|f (x)| and |f^ (x)|$ are both finite, thenfar stronger integrability condition than the finitenessf must be bounded (which is a of Another very useful concept is that of$f1)$. duality [III.19](/part - 03/duality). Given a function spacedual space$X^{*}$, which is formally defined as the class$X$, one can define the of allcisely all maps continuous linear functionalsω:$X \to R (or ω$: X \to on CX, if the function, or more pre- space is complex valued) that are linear and continuous with respect to the norm of X . For example, it turns out that every linear functionalω on the space Lp [-1, 1] is of the form

$ω(f ) =^{-1}^{1} f (x)g(x) dx$

for some functiong in Lq[-1,1], where q is the dual$or1$/pconjugate exponent+ 1/q = 1. of p, defined by the equation One can sometimes analyze functions in a function space by looking instead at how the linear function-als in the dual space act on those functions. Similarly, one can often analyze a continuous linear operator$T$: X \to  Y from one function space to another by first considering the adjoint operator$T^{*}$:$Y^{*} \to X^{*}$, defined for all linear functionals T*ω be the functional on Xdefined by the formulaω:$Y \to R \text{by letting} T^{*}ω(x) = ω(T x)$.

We mention one more important fact about function spaces, which is that certain function spaces“interpolate” between two other function spaces$X^{0} \text{and XXspaces}^{1}$. For example, there is a natural sense in which the Lp[-1, 1] with 1 < p < \infty“lie between” the spaces L1[-1, 1] and L\infty [-1,1]. The precise definition of interpolation is too technical for this article, but its usefulness lies in the fact that the “extreme” spaces$X0$ andmediate” spaces$X^{1}$are often easier to deal with than the “inter-X. For this reason, it is sometimes possible to prove difficult results aboutmuch easier results about$X^{0} and X^{1}$and “interpolat-X by proving ing” between them. For instance, it can be used to give

Interpolation is useful here because the inequality iseasy to prove in the extreme cases when$p = 1$, whenq = 1, \text{or when} r = $\i\text{nf ty}$. It is much harder to prove this result without the help of interpolation theory. III.30 Galois Groups Given a polynomial function cients, the splitting field of$f$is defined to be the small-$f$with rational co ef fie stand all the roots offield [I.3 §2.2](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) that contains all rational numbersf . The Galois group of f is the group of allfield. Each such automorphism permutes the roots of automorphisms [I.3 §4.1](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) of the splittingf , so the Galois group can be thought of as a subset of the group of all structure and properties of the Galois group are closely permutations [III.68](/part-03/permutation-groups) of these roots. The connected with the solubility of the polynomial: in par-ticular, the Galois group can be used to show that not all polynomials aremeans of a formula that involves the usual arithmetic solvable by radicals (that is, solvable by operations together with the extraction of roots). This theorem, spectacular as it is, is by no means the only application of Galois groups: they play a central role in modern algebraic number theory.For more details, see the insolubility of the quintic [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic) and algebraic numbers [IV.1 §20](/part-04/number-theory).

Actually, for various rea-sons it is natural to define$Γ \text{so that} Γ (n) = (n - 1)$! for n = 2, 3, . . . . Let us start by writing\inftyΓ (s) =0 (xs)-1 e-x dx, (1)

without paying too much attention to whether the inte-gral converges. If we integrate by parts, then we find that Γ (s) = [-(xs)-1 e-x ]\infty0 +0 \infty (s - 1)(xs)-2 e-x dx. (2)$As$ xtends to infinity,(xs)-1 e-x tends to zero, and ifsxsis, for example, a real number greater than 1, then-1 = 0 when x = 0. Therefore, for such s, we can ignore the first term in the above expression. But thesecond one is simply the formula for$Γ (s - 1)$, so we have shown that$Γ (s) = (s - 1)Γ (s - 1)$, which is just what we need if we want to think oflike$(s - 1)$!.Γ (s) as something It is not hard to show that the integral is in fact convergent whenever real part of$s$) is positive. Moreover, it defines as is a complex number and Re(s)holo-(the morphic function real part ofs is negative, the integral does not converge[I.3 §5.6](/part-01/fundamental-definitions) in that region. When the at all, and so the formula (1) cannot be used to definethe gamma function in its entirety. However, we can instead use the property the definition. For example, when$Γ (s) = (s --11)Γ (s< Re - 1(s)) to⩽extend0$, we know that the definition does not work directly, but itdoes work fors + 1, since Re(s + 1) > 0. We would likeΓ (sto be+1Γ (s) to equal+ 1)/s. Once we have done this, we can turnsΓ (s), so it makes sense to defineΓ (s) our attention to values of$s with - 2 < Re(s) ⩽ -1$, and so on. example), we have divided by zero. This is perfectly permissible, however, if all we require of The reader may object that in definingΓ Γ (\text{is that it}0) (for should befunctions are allowed to take the “value”meromorphic [V.31](/part-05/the-riemannroch-theorem), \text{because meromorphic}\infty .

This formula makes it clear thatΓ never vanishes, and that it has simple poles at 0 and the negative integers. Why is the gamma function important? A simple reason is that it occurs frequently in many parts of mathe-matics, but one can still ask why this should be so. One reason is thatform of the unarguably natural functionΓ$, \text{as defined in} (1)$, is the Mellin trans-$f (x) = e^{-x}$. The Mellin transform is a type of[III.27](/part - 03/the - fourier - transform), but it is defined for functions on the group fourier transform $(R^{+}$, \times ) rather than (R,+) (which is the habitat of the most familiar type of Fourier transform). For this reason, lytic number theoryΓ is often seen in number theory, particularly[IV.2](/part-04/number-theory), where multiplicative lyana- defined functions are often studied by taking fourier transforms. text is in the functional equation for the One appearance ofΓ in a number-theoretical con-riemann zeta function [IV.2 §3](/part-04/number-theory), namely,

A veryn! is$(n/e)^{n}$, which tells us that log(n!$) \text{is about} n(\log n - 1)$. Stir- ling’s formula is a sharper version of this crude esti-mate. Letδ > 0 and suppose that z is a complex num- ber that has modulus at least 1 and argument between-π + δ and π - δ. (This second condition keeps z away from the negative real axis, where the poles are.) Then Stirling’s formula states that $\log Γ (z) = (z -^{1}^{2}) \log z - z +^{1}^{2} log 2π + E$, where the error E is at most C(δ)/|z|. Here, C(δ) stands for a certain positive real number that dependsonδ. (The smaller you make δ, the larger you have to make exponentially as Im C(δ).) Using this, one may confirm thatz → $\i\text{nf ty}$ in any fixed vertical strip inΓ decays the complex plane. In fact, if$α < σ < β$, then|Γ (σ + it)| ⩽ C(α, β)|t(|β)-1(e-()π){|}t | / 2 for all$|t| > 1$, \text{uniformly in} σ .

If the structure is quite complicated, sometimes make it easier by considering a different object, the generating function of the sequence, which contains the same information.To define this function, one simply regards the sequence series. That is, the generating function an as the sequence of coefficients in a powerf of the se- quence is given by the formula $f (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · ·$. The reason this can be useful is that one can some-times derive a succinct expression forf and analyze it

At first glance, the many theories and equations ofmodern physics exhibit a bewildering diversity: for instance, compare classical mechanics with quantum mechanics, or nonrelativistic physics with relativistic physics, or particle physics with statistical mechanics.However, there are strong unifying themes connecting all of these theories. One of these is the remarkable fact that in all of them the evolution of a physical system over time (as well as the steady states of that sys-tem) is largely controlled by a single object, the hamiltonian as describing the total energy of any given state in thatof that system, which can often be interpreted system. Roughly speaking, each physical phenomenon(e.g., ele ct ro magnetism, atomic bonding, particles in a potential well, etc.) may correspond to a single hamiltonian tum, statistical, etc.) corresponds to a different way H, while each type of mechanics (classical, quan-

This simple example already illuminates a fundamen-tal property of the heat equation: the tendency of its solutions to converge to an equilibrium state.

A variety of more general heat equations can beobtained if one replaces the Laplacian by a more general linear, tonianself-adjoint[III.35](/part-03/hamiltonians)H with a discrete set of eigenvalues[III.50 §3.2](/part-03/linear-operators-and-their-properties), nonnegative hamil\lambda n \text{and corresponding \text{eigenfunctions}} ψn.

To obtain such descriptions one has to abandon the idea of constructing solu-tions explicitly and look instead for principles and methods that apply to general classes of solutions while also being sufficiently robust to be useful in the analysis of more complicated heat equations.The first methods of this type are called energy identities heat equation by a certain quantity, which may depend. To derive an energy identity, one multiplies the on the given solution, and integrates by parts. The simplest two identities of this type are thetotal heat of an insulated body, conservation of d

and the energy identity,

$tΩ u^{2}(t$, x)dx + (20)Ω |∇u(s, x=)|2 dxud2(s0, x) dx. The second identity already captures a fundamental smoothing property of the heat equation: since all threeΩ integrands are nonnegative and the first and third integrals are finite, the average of the mean-square gradientofuis finite, even if the initial mean-square gradient is infinite, and it even decreases to zero withaway from the boundary ofΩ an arbitrary amount oft. In fact, smoothing takes place, and not just on average but atevery time$t > 0$. tion is the The second fundamental principle of the heat equa-global maximum principle $x \in^{Ω}$,\ma(x0()⩽){t}⩽ T u(t$,⩽x\max ) u(0, x)$, \max u(t, x)$, x\in\partialΩ$,0⩽t⩽T

This tells us that if the temperature a(t1)2 x1$at$ x2 at time1 t2 cannot be too much smaller. This form of the Harnack inequality features a very important object in the study of the heat equation, called the heat kernel: p(t$, x, y) = (4πt)1n/2 e^{−}|x^{-}y^{|}2^{/}4 t$. One of its many uses is that it allows one to construct solutions of the heat equation in the whole of space (that is, in R$n) \text{from initial data} u^{0}$, by the formulau(t, x) =R n p(t, x, y)u0(y)dy.

One can even look at the equations in “nondivergence form”: $\partial t\partial u -^{i}$, jn=1 aij (x)∂x∂i ∂x∂j u = 0.
