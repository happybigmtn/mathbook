build entire theories of groups or rings or fields. These abstract theories may then be applied in diverse settings where the basic axioms are satisfied but where it may not be at all apparent a priori that a group or a ring or a field may be lurking. This, in fact, is one of modern algebra’s great strengths: once we have proved a general fact about an algebraic structure, there is no need to prove that fact separately each time we come across an instance of that structure.
This abstract approach allows us to recognize that contexts that may look quite different are in fact importantly similar. How is it that two endeavors--the high school analysis of polynomial equations and the modern algebra of the research mathematician--so seemingly different in their objectives, in their tools, and in their philosophical out looks are both called “algebra”? Are they even related? In fact, they are, but the story of how they are is long and complicated. $2$ Algebra before There Was Algebra:
From Old Babylon to the Hellenistic Era Solutions of what would today be recognized as first and second-degree polynomial equations may be found in Old Babylonian cuneiform texts that date to the second millennium b.c.e. However, these problems were neither written in a notation that would be recognizable to our modern-day high school student nor solved using the kinds of general techniques so characteristic of the high school algebra classroom. Rather, particular problems were posed, and particular solutions obtained, from a series of recipe-like steps.
No general theoretical justification was given, and the problems were largely cast geometrically, in terms of measurable line segments and surfaces of particular areas. Consider, for example, this problem, translated and transcribed from a clay tablet held in the British Museum (catalogued as $BM 13901$ , problem 1) that dates from between 1800$and$1600 b.c.e.: The surface of my confrontation I have accumulated:

$45$ is it. $1$ , the projection, you posit. The moiety of $1$ you break, $30$ and $30$ you make hold. $15$ to $45$ you append: by $1$ , $1$ is equalside. $30$ which you have made hold in the inside you tear out: $30$ the confrontation. This may be translated into modern notation as the

$3$

equation $x^{2} + 1x = {}^{4}$ , where it is important to notice that the Babylonian number system is base $60$ , so $453$

denotes $45{}^{60} = {}^{4}$ . The text then lays out the following algorithm for solving the problem: take $1$ , the coefficient of the linear term, and halve it to get $\frac{1}{2}$ . Square $\frac{1}{2}$

$113$

to ge$t^{4}$ . Ad$d^{4}$ t$o^{4}$ , the constant term, to get $1$ . This is

$1$

the square of $1$ . Subtract from this th$e^{2}$ which you mul$1$ tiplied by to get $2$ , the side of the square. The modern reader can easily see that this algorithm is equivalent to what is now called the quadratic formula, but the Babylonian tablet presents it in the context of a particular problem and repeats it in the contexts of other particular problems. There are no equations in the modern sense; the Babylonian writer is literally effecting a construction of plane figures.
Similar problems and similar algorithmic solutions can also be found in ancient Egyptian texts such as the Rhind papyrus, believed to have been copied in 1650 b.c.e. from a text that was about a century and a half older. There is a sharp contrast between the problem-oriented, untheoretical approach characteristic of texts from this early period and the axiomatic and deductive approach that euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca) introduced into mathematics in around $300$ b.c.e. in his magisterial, geometrical treatise, the Elements.
(See geometry [II.2](/part-02/geometry-origins) for a further discussion of this work .) There, building on explicit definitions and a small number of axioms or selfevident truths, Euclid proceeded to deduce known-- and almost certainly some hitherto unknown--results within a strictly geometrical context. Geometry done in this axiomatic context defined Euclid’s standard of rigor. But what does this quintessential ly geometrical text have to do with algebra? Consider the sixth proposition in Euclid’s Book II, ostensibly a book on plane figures, and in particular quadrilaterals:
If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line. While clearly a geometrical construction, it equally clearly describes two constructions--one a rectangle and one a square--that have equal areas. It therefore describes something that we should be able to write as an equation.
Figure $1$ gives the picture corresponding to Euclid’s construction: he proves that the area of rectangle ADMK equals the sum of rectangles CDML and HMFG. To do this, he adds the square on CB-- namely, square LHGE--to CDML and HMFG. This gives square CDFE. It is not hard to see that this is equivalent to the high school procedure of “completing the square” and to the algebraic equation (2 a + b)b + a2 =(a + b)2 , which we obtain by setting $CB = a$ and

Algebra before There Was Algebra:

The Medieval Islamic World

The transmission of mathematical ideas was, however, a complex process. After the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent decline of learning in the West, both the Euclidean and the Diophantine traditions ultimately made their way into the medieval Islamic world. There they were not only preserved--thanks to the active translation initiatives of Islamic scholars--but also studied and extended. al-khwārizmı̄ [VI.5](/part-06/abu-jafar-muhammad-ibn-musa-al-khwarizm-vi55-william-kingdon-cliord-18451879) was a scholar at the royally funded House of Wisdom in Baghdad.
He linked the kinds of geometrical arguments Euclid had presented in Book II of his Elements with the indigenous problemsolving algorithms that dated back to Old Babylonian times. In particular, he wrote a book on practical mathematics, entitled al-Kitāb al-mukhtas.ar fı̄ h . isāb al-jabr wa’l-muqābala (“ The compendious book on calculation by completion and balancing ”), beginning it with a theoretical discussion of what we would now recognize as polynomial equations of the first and second degrees.
(The latinization of the word “al-jabr” or “completion” in his title gave us our modern term “algebra . ”) Because he employed neither negative numbers nor zero coefficients, al-Khwārizmı̄ provided a systematization in terms of six separate kinds of examples where we would need just one, namely $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ . He considered, for example, the case when “a square and $10$ roots are equal to $39$ units,” and his algorithmic solution in terms of multiplications, additions, and subtractions was in precisely the same form as the above solution from tablet BM 13901 .
This, however, was not enough for al-Khwārizmı̄. “It is necessary,” he said, “that we should demonstrate geometrically the truth of the same problems which we have explained in numbers,” and he proceeded to do this by “completing the square” in geometrical terms reminiscent of, but not as formal as, those Euclid used in Book II. (Ab. ar{u} Kāmil (ca .
$850 - 930$ ), an Egyptian Islamic mathematician of the generation after al-Khwārizmı̄, introduced a higher level of Euclidean formality into the geometric-algorithmic setting .) This juxtaposition made explicit how the relationships between geometrical areas and lines could be interpreted in terms of numerical multiplications, additions, and subtractions,

a key step that would ultimately suggest a move away from the geometrical solution of particular problems and toward an algebraic solution of general types of equations. Another step along this path was taken by the mathematician and poet Omar Khayyam ( $ca$ . $1050 - 1130)$ in a book he entitled Al-jabr after al-Khwārizmı̄’s work. Here he proceeded to systematize and solve what we would recognize, in the absence of both negative numbers and zero coefficients, as the cases of the cubic equation.
Following al-Khwārizmı̄, Khayyam provided geometrical justifications, yet his work, even more than that of his predecessor, may be seen as closer to a general problem-solving technique for specific cases of equations, that is, closer to the notion of algebra. The Persian mathematician al-Karajı̄ (who flourished in the early eleventh century) also knew well and appreciated the geometrical tradition stemming from Euclid’s Elements.
However, like Abū-Kāmil, he was aware of the Diophantine tradition too, and synthesized in more general terms some of the procedures Diophantus had laid out in the context of specific examples in the Arithmetica. Although Diophantus’s ideas and style were known to these and other medieval Islamic mathematicians, they would remain unknown in the Latin West until their rediscovery and translation in the sixteenth century.
Equally unknown in the Latin West were the accomplishments of Indian mathematicians, who had succeeded in solving some quadratic equations algorithmically by the beginning of the eighth century and who, like Bragmagupta four hundred years later, had techniques for finding integer solutions to particular examples of what are today called Pell’s equations, namely, equations of the form $ax^{2} + b = y^{2}$ , where $a$ and $b$ are integers and a is not a square. $4$ Algebra before There Was Algebra:
The Latin West Concurrent with the rise of Islam in the East, the Latin West under went a gradual cultural and political stabilization in the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire. By the thirteenth century, this relative stability had resulted in the firm entrenchment of the Catholic Church as well as the establishment both of universities and of an active economy. More over, the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula in the eighth century and the subsequent establishment there of an Islamic court, library, and

$100$

etc.; and “compared magnitudes”--that is, coefficients (B length) of dimension one, (B plane) of dimension two, (B solid) of dimension three, etc. In the light of his law of homogeneity, then, Viète could legitimately perform the operation (A cube)  +  (B plane) (A side) (or x ${}^{3} +$ bx in our notation), since the dimension of (A cube) is three, as is that of the product of the two-dimensional coefficient (B plane) and the one-dimensional variable (A side), but he could not legally add the three dimensional variable (A cube) to the two-dimensional product of the one-dimensional
coefficient (B length) and the one-dimensional variable (A side) (or , again, x ${}^{3} +$ bx in our notation). Be this as it may, his “analytic art” still allowed him to add, subtract, multiply, and divide letters as opposed to specific numbers, and those letters, as long as they satisfied the law of homogeneity, could be raised to the second, third, fourth, or, indeed, any power. He had a rudimentary algebra, although he failed to apply it to curves.
The first mathematicians to do that were fermat [VI.12](/part-06/pierre-fermat-1601665) and descartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) in their independent development of the analytic geometry so familiar to the high school algebra student of today. Fermat, and others like Thomas Harriot ( $ca$ . $1560 - 1621)$ in England, were influenced in their approaches by Viète, while Descartes not only introduced our present-day notational convention of representing variables by x’$s$ and $y$’s and constants by a’s, b’s, and c’s but also began the arithmetization of algebra.
He introduced a unit that allowed him to interpret all geometrical magnitudes as line segments, whether they were x’s, $x^{2}$ ’s, $x^{3}$ ’s, $x^{4}$ ’s, or any higher power of x, there by removing concerns about homogeneity. Fermat’s main work in this direction was $a_{1636}$ manuscript written in Latin, entitled “Introduction to plane and solid loci” and circulated among the early seventeenth-century mathematical cognoscenti; Descartes’s was La Géométrie, written in French as one of three appendices to his philosophical tract, Discours de la Méthode, published in 1637 .
Both were regarded as establishing the identification of geometrical curves with equations in two unknowns, or in other words as establishing analytic geometry and there by introducing algebraic techniques into the solution of what had previously been considered geometrical problems. In Fermat’s case, the curves were lines or conic sections--quadratic expressions in $x$ and $y$; Descartes did this too, but he also considered equations more generally, tackling questions about the roots of polynomial equations that were connected with transforming and reducing the polynomials.

II. The Origins of Modern Mathematics

In particular, although he gave no proof or even general statement of it, Descartes had a rudimentary version of what we would now call the fundamental theorem of algebra [V.13](/part-05/the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra), the result that a polynomial equation $x^{n} + a^{n} - {}^{1}x^{n} - {}^{1} +$ · · · $+ a^{1}x + a^{0}$ of degree n has precisely n roots over the field C of complex numbers. For example, while he held that a given polynomial of degree n could be decomposed into n linear factors, he also recognized that the cubic $x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 13x - 10 = 0$ has three roots:
the real root $2$ and two complex roots. In his further exploration of these issues, more over, he developed algebraic techniques, involving suitable transformations, for analyzing polynomial equations of the fifth and sixth degrees. Liberated from homogeneity concerns, Descartes was thus able to use his algebraic techniques freely to explore territory where the geometrically bound Cardano had clearly been reluctant to venture.
newton [VI.14](/part-06/isaac-newton-16421727) took the liberation of algebra from geometrical concerns a step further in his Arithmetica Universalis (or Universal Arithmetic) of 1707 , arguing for the complete arithmetization of algebra, that is, for modeling algebra and algebraic operations on the real numbers and the usual operations of arithmetic. Descartes’s La Géométrie highlighted at least two problems for further algebraic exploration: the fundamental theorem of algebra and the solution of polynomial equations of degree greater than four.
Although eighteenth-century mathematicians like d’alembert [VI.20](/part-06/jean-le-rond-dalembert-17171783) and euler [VI.19](/part-06/leonhard-euler-17071783) attempted proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, the first person to prove it rigorously was gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855), who gave four distinct proofs over the course of his career.
His first, an algebraic geometrical proof, appeared in his doctoral dissertation of 1799 , while a second, fundamentally different proof was published in 1816 , which in modern terminology essentially involved constructing the polynomial’s splitting field. While the fundamental theorem of algebra established how many roots a given polynomial equation has, it did not provide insight into exactly what those roots were or how precisely to find them.
That problem and its many mathematical repercussions exercised a number of mathematicians in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and formed one of the strands of the mathematical thread that became modern algebra in the early twentieth century. Another emerged from attempts to understand the general behavior of systems of (one or more) polynomials in n unknowns, and yet another grew from efforts to approach number-theoretic questions algebraically.

The Search for the Roots

of Algebraic Equations

The problem of finding roots of polynomials provides a direct link from the algebra of the high school classroom to that of the modern research mathematician. Today’s high school student dutifully employs the quadratic formula to calculate the roots of seconddegree polynomials. To derive this formula, one transforms the given polynomial into one that can be solved more easily. By more complicated manipulations of cubics and quartics, Cardano and Ferrari obtained formulas for the roots of those as well. It is natural to ask whether the same can be done for higher-degree polynomials.
More precisely, are there formulas that involve just the usual operations of arithmetic--addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division--together with the extraction of roots? When there is such a formula, one says that the equation is solvable by radicals.
Although many eighteenth-century mathematicians (including Euler, Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde (1735-96), waring [VI.21](/part-06/edward-waring-ca), and Étienne Bézout (1730-83)) contributed to the effort to decide whether higherorder polynomial equations are solvable by radicals, it was not until the years from roughly 1770$to$1830 that there were significant breakthroughs, particularly in the work of lagrange [VI.22](/part-06/joseph-louis-lagrange-17361813), abel [VI.33](/part-06/niels-henrik-abel-18021829), and Gauss.
In a lengthy set of “Réflections sur la résolution algébrique des équations” (Reflections on the algebraic resolution of equations) published in 1771 , Lagrange tried to determine principles underlying the resolution of algebraic equations in general by analyzing in detail the specific cases of the cubic and the quartic.
Building on the work of Cardano, Lagrange showed that a cubic of the form $x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ could always be transformed into a cubic with no quadratic term $x^{3} + px + q = 0$ and that the roots of this could be written as $x = u + v,$ where $u^{3}$ and $v^{3}$ are the roots of a certain quadratic polynomial equation.
Lagrange was then able to show that if $x^{1}$ , $x^{2}$ , $x^{3}$ are the three roots of the cubic, the intermediate functions $u$ and $v1$ could actually be written as $u = {}^{3}(x^{1} + αx^{2} + α^{2}x^{3})12$ and $v = {}^{3}(x^{1} + α x^{2} + αx^{3})$ , for α a primitive cube root of unity. That is, $u$ and $v$ could be written as rational expressions or resolvents in $x^{1}$ , $x^{2}$ , $x^{3}$ .
Conversely, starting with a linear expression $y = Ax^{1} + Bx^{2} + Cx^{3}$ in the roots $x^{1}$ , $x^{2}$ , $x^{3}$ and then permuting the roots in all possible ways yielded six expressions each of which was a root of a particular sixth-degree polynomial equation. An analysis of the latter equation (which $101$ involved the exploitation of properties of symmetric polynomials) yielded the same expressions for $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x^{1}$ , $x^{2}$ , $x^{3}$ and the cube root of unity α.
As Lagrange showed, this kind of two-pronged analysis-- involving intermediate expressions rational in the roots that are solutions of a solvable equation as well as the behavior of certain rational expressions under permutation of the roots--yielded the complete solution in the cases both of the cubic and the quartic. It was one approach that encompassed the solution of both types of equation. But could this technique be extended to the case of the quintic and higher-degree polynomials?
Lagrange was unable to push it through in the case of the quintic, but by building on his ideas, first his student Paolo Ruffini ( $1765 - 1822$ ) at the turn of the nineteenth century and then, definitively, the young Norwegian mathematician Abel in the $1820s$ showed that, in fact, the quintic is not solvable by radicals. (See the insolubility of the quintic [V.21](/part-05/the-insolubility-of-the-quintic).) This negative result, however, still left open the questions of which algebraic equations were solvable by radicals and why.
As Lagrange’s analysis seemed to underscore, the answer to this question in the cases of the cubic and the quartic involved in a critical way the cube and fourth roots of unity, respectively. By definition, these satisfy the particularly simple polynomial equations $x^{3} - 1 = 0$ and $x^{4} - 1 = 0$ , respectively. It was thus natural to examine the general case of the so-called cyclotomic equation $x^{n} - 1 = 0$ and ask for what values n the nth roots of unity are actually constructible. To put this question in equivalent algebraic terms:
for which n is it possible to find a formula for the nth roots of unity that expresses them in terms of integers using the usual arithmetical operations and extraction of square (but not higher) roots? This was one of the many questions explored by Gauss in his wide-ranging, magisterial, and groundbreaking 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. One of his most famous results was that the regular $17$ - gon (or , equivalently, $a 17th$ root of unity) was constructible.
In the course of his analysis, he not only employed techniques similar to those developed by Lagrange but also developed key concepts such as modular arithmetic [III.58](/part-03/modular-arithmetic) and the properties of the modular “worlds” Z p , for p a prime, and, more generally, Z n , for n $\in$ Z + , as well as the notion of a primitive element (a generator) of what would later be termed a cyclic group. Although it is not clear how well he knew Gauss’s work, in the years around 1830 galois [VI.41](/part-06/variste-galois-18111832) drew from the ideas both of Lagrange on the analysis of
