participant gets to know the primes that were used to produce the modulus. To decipher a message enciphered under this modulus the two participants have to collaborate--neither can achieve this on their own (Cocks 1997). A third and more amusing example is a protocol that allows Alice and Bob to replicate tossing a coin, but to do it over the telephone. Obviously, it would not be satisfactory for Alice to toss the coin and for Bob to make the call “heads” or “tails”--for how does Bob know that Alice is telling the truth about how the coin actually fell? This problem turns out to have a simple solution. Alice and Bob choose large random sequences. Alice then appends either $a 1$ or $a 0$ to her sequence and Bob does the same for his. Alice’s extra bit represents the outcome of the coin toss, and Bob’s represents his guess. Next, they send one-way hashes of their sequences (with the extra bits appended). At this point, because of the nature of one-way hashes, neither has any idea what the other’s sequence is, so, for example, if Alice reveals her hashed sequence first, Bob cannot use this information to increase his chance of guessing correctly. Alice and Bob then exchange the unhashed sequences to see whether Bob’s guess was correct. If either does not trust the other, they can hash the other’s sequence to check that it really does give the right answer. Since it is hard to find a different sequence that gives the right answer, they can each be confident that the other has not cheated. More complicated protocols of this type have been designed--it is even possible to play poker remotely in this way.

Becky’s World

Becky, who is ten years old, lives with her parents and an older brother Sam in a suburban town in America’s Midwest. Becky’s father works in a law firm specializing in small business enterprises. Depending on the firm’s profits, his annual income varies somewhat, but it is rarely below 145000 . Becky’s parents met in college. For a few years her mother worked in publishing, but when Sam was born she decided to concentrate on raising a family. Now that both Becky and Sam attend school, she does voluntary work in local education. The family live in a two-story house. It has four bedrooms, two bathrooms upstairs and a toilet downstairs, a large drawing-cum-dining room, a modern kitchen, and a family room in the basement. There is a small plot of land in the rear, which the family use for leisure activities. Although they have a partial mortgage on their property, Becky’s parents own stocks and bonds and have a savings account in the local branch of a national bank. Becky’s father and his firm jointly contribute to his retirement pension. He also makes monthly payments into a scheme with the bank that will cover college education for Becky and Sam. The family’s assets and their lives are insured. Becky’s parents often remark that, federal taxes being high, they have to be careful with

money; and they are. Nevertheless, they own two cars, the children attend camp each summer, and the family take a vacation together once camp is over. Becky’s parents also remark that her generation will be much more prosperous than they. Becky wants to save the environment and insists on biking to school each day. Her ambition is to become a doctor.

Desta’s World

Desta, who is about ten years old, lives with her parents and five siblings in a village in subtropical, southwest Ethiopia. The family live in a two-room, grass-roofed mud hut. Desta’s father grows maize and tef on half a hectare of land that the government has awarded him. Desta’s older brother helps him to farm the land and care for the household’s livestock: a cow, a goat, and a few chickens. The small quantity of tef produced is sold so as to raise cash income, but the maize is largely consumed by the household as a staple. Desta’s mother works a small plot next to their cottage, growing cabbage, onions, and enset (a year-round root crop that also serves as a staple). In order to supplement household income, she brews a local drink made from maize. As she is also responsible for cooking, cleaning, and minding the infants, her work day usually lasts fourteen hours. Despite the long hours, it would not be possible for her to complete the tasks on her own. (As the ingredients are all raw, cooking alone takes five hours or more .) So Desta and her older sister help their mother with household chores and mind their younger siblings. Although a younger brother attends the local school, neither Desta nor her older sister has ever been enrolled there. Her parents can neither read nor write, but they are numerate. Desta’s home has no electricity or running water. Around where they live, sources of water, land for grazing cattle, and the woodlands are communal property. They are shared by people in Desta’s village; but the villagers do not allow outsiders to make use of them. Each day Desta’s mother and the girls fetch water, collect fuelwood, and pick berries and herbs from the local commons. Desta’s mother frequently observes that the time and effort needed to collect their daily needs has increased over the years. There is no financial institution nearby to offer either credit or insurance. As funerals are expensive occasions, Desta’s father long ago joined a community insurance scheme (iddir) to which he contributes monthly. When Desta’s father purchased the cow they now own, he used the entire cash he had accumulated

and stored at home, but had to supplement that with funds borrowed from kinfolk, with a promise to repay the debt when he had the ability to do so. In turn, when they are in need, his kinfolk come to him for a loan, which he supplies if he is able to. Desta’s father says that such patterns of reciprocity he and those close to him practice are part of their culture, reflecting their norms of social conduct. He also says that his sons are his main assets, as they are the ones who will look after him and Desta’s mother in their old age. Economic statisticians estimate that, adjusting for differences in the cost of living between Ethiopia and the United States, Desta’s family income is about 5000$\text{per year}$, \text{of which} 1000 is attributable to the products they draw from the local commons. However, as rainfall varies from year to year, Desta’s family income fluctuates widely. In bad years, the grain they store at home gets depleted well before the next harvest. Food is then so scarce that they all grow weaker, the younger children especially so. It is only after harvest that they regain their weight and strength. Periodic hunger and illnesses have meant that Desta and her siblings are somewhat stunted. Over the years Desta’s parents have lost two children in their infancy, stricken by malaria in one case and diarrhea in the other. There have also been several miscarriages. Desta knows that she will be married (in all likelihood to a farmer, like her father) when she reaches eighteen and will then live on her husband’s land in a neighboring village. She expects her life to be similar to that of her mother.

The Economist’s Agenda

That the lives people are able to construct differ enormously across the globe is a commonplace. In our age of travel, it is even a common sight. That Becky and Desta face widely different futures is also something we have come to expect, perhaps also to accept. Nevertheless, it may not be out of turn to imagine that the two girls are intrinsically very similar: they both enjoy eating, playing, and gossiping; they are close to their families; they like pretty things to wear; and they both have the capacity to be disappointed, get annoyed, be happy. Their parents are also alike. They are knowledgeable about the ways of their worlds. They also care about their families, finding ingenious ways to meet the recurring problem of producing income and allocating resources among family members--over time and allowing for unexpected contingencies. So, a promising

route for exploring the underlying causes behind their vastly different conditions of life would be to begin by observing that the constraints the families face are very different: that in some sense Desta’s family are far more restricted in what they are able to be and do than Becky’s. Economics in large measure tries to uncover the processes that influence how people’s lives come to be what they are. The context may be a household, a village, a district, a state, a country, or the whole world. In its remaining measure, the discipline tries to identify ways to influence those very processes so as to improve the prospects of those who are hugely constrained in what they can be and do. Modern economics, by which I mean the style of economics taught and practiced in today’s graduate schools, does the exercises from the ground up: from individuals, through the household, village, district, state, country, to the whole world. In varying degrees the millions of individual decisions shape the eventualities people all face; as both theory and evidence tell us that there are enormous numbers of unintended consequences of what we all do. But there is also a feedback, in that those consequences go on to shape what people subsequently can do and choose to do. For example, when Becky’s family drive their cars or use electricity, or when Desta’s family create compost or burn wood for cooking, they contribute to global carbon emissions. Their contributions are no doubt negligible, but the millions of such tiny contributions cumulatively sum to a sizable amount, having consequences that people every where are likely to experience in different ways. To understand Becky’s and Desta’s lives, we need first of all to identify the prospects they face for transforming goods and services into further goods and services--now and in the future, under various contingencies. Second, we need to uncover the character of their choices and the pathways by which the choices made by millions of households like Becky’s and Desta’s go to produce the prospects they all face. Third, and relatedly, we need to uncover the pathways by which the families came to inherit their current circumstances. The last of these is the stuff of economic history. In studying history we could, should we feel bold, take the long view--from about the time agriculture came to be settled practice in the Fertile Crescent (roughly , Anatolia) some eleven thousand years ago--and try to explain why the many innovations and practices that have cumulatively contributed to the making of

$897$

Becky’s world either did not reach or did not take hold in Desta’s part of the world. (Diamond ( 1997 ) is an enquiry into this set of questions .) If we wanted a sharper account, we could study, say, the past six hundred years and ask how it is that, instead of the several regions in Eurasia that were economically promising in about 1400 c.e., it was the unlikely northern Europe that made it and helped to create Becky’s world, even while bypassing Desta’s. (Landes ( 1998 ) is an inquiry into that question. Fogel ( 2004 ) explores the pathways by which Europe during the past three hundred years has escaped permanent hunger .) As modern economics is largely concerned with the first two sets of enquiries, this article focuses on them. However, the methods that today’s economic historians deploy to answer their questions are not dissimilar to the ones I describe below to study contemporary lives. The methods involve studying individual and collective choices in terms of maximization exercises. The predictions of the theories are then tested by studying data relating to actual behavior. Even the ethical foundations of national economic policies involve maximization exercises: the maximization of social well-being subject to constraints. (The treatise that codified this approach to economic reasoning was Samuelson ( 1947 ).)

The Household Maximization Problem

Both Becky’s and Desta’s households are microeconomies. Each subscribes to particular arrangements over who does what and when, recognizing that it faces constraints on what its members are capable of doing. We imagine that both sets of parents have their families’ well-being in mind and want to do as well as they can to protect and promote it. 1 Of course, both Becky’s and Desta’s parents would have a wider notion of what constitutes their families than I have allowed here. Maintaining ties with kinfolk would be an important aspect of their lives, a matter I return to later. One also imagines that Becky’s and Desta’s parents are interested in their future grandchildren’s well-being. But as they recognize that their children will in turn care about their children, they are right to conclude by recursion that doing the best for their children amounts to doing the best for their grandchildren, for their great grandchildren, and so on, down the generations. $1$ . As suggested by Mc Elroy and Horney in 1981 , a realistic alternative would be to suppose that household decisions are reached by negotiation between the various parties (see Dasgupta 1993 , chapter $11$ ) . Qualitatively, nothing much is lost in my assuming optimizing households here.

imposing taxes, subsidies, and transfers, and should be engaged in supplying public goods. The government is also the natural agency to supply infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and electrical cables, requiring as they do investments that are huge in comparison with individual incomes. We shall now extend our earlier model to include public goods and infrastructure, so that we can study the government’s economic task. Let us assume that social well-being is a numerical aggregate of household well-beings. Thus, if V is social well-being, we write it as V ($W^{1}$ , . . . , W H). It is natural to postulate that V increases as any W h increases. (One example of such a function V is the one prescribed by utilitarian philosophy, namely, $W^{1} +$ · · · $+ W^{H}$ .) The government chooses what quantities to supply of the various public goods and infrastructure commodities. These numbers can be modeled by two vectors, which we will call G and I, respectively. The government also chooses to impose on each household h certain transfers T h of goods and services (for example, providing health care and charging income tax). Let us write T for the sequence ($T^{1}$ , . . . , T H). Whether or not a particular choice of vectors G and I is actually feasible for the government will depend on T , so we define K T to be the set of feasible pairs of vectors (G , I), given the choice of T . Because we have introduced a new set of goods, we shall have to modify the household well-being functions by enlarging their domains. The obvious notation to express this extra dependence is to write W h (X h , G, I, T h) for the well-being of household h. Moreover, h’s feasible set F h now also depends on G, I, and T h ; so we write the set of feasible household choices as F h (G , I, T h , X  -  h). To try to determine the optimum public policy, imagine a two-stage game. The government has the first move, choosing T and then G and I from K T . Households go second, reacting to decisions made by the government. Imagine that a social equilibrium ∗ X ∗  =  ($X^{1}$ ∗ , . . . , X H ) is reached and that the equilibrium is unique. (We assume that if there are multiple equilibria, the government can select among them by resorting to public signals .) Clearly, this equilibrium X ∗ is a function of G, I, and T . An intelligent and benevolent government will anticipate it and choose T , G, and I from K T in such a way as to maximize the resulting ∗ social well-being V (W ($X^{1}$ ∗), . . . , W (X H )). The public policy problem we have just designed, involving as it does a double optimization, is technically very difficult. It transpires, for example, that even

VII. The Influence of Mathematics

in some of the simplest model economies one can imagine, F h (G , I, T h , X  -  h) is not convex. This means that the social equilibrium cannot be guaranteed to depend continuously on G, I, and T , as was shown by Mirrlees in 1984 . This in turn means that standard techniques are not suitable for the government’s optimization problem. In fact, of course, even “double optimization” is a huge simplification. The government chooses; people respond by trading, producing, consuming; the government chooses again; people respond once again--and so forth in an unending series of moves and countermoves. Identifying the optimum public policy involves severe computational difficulties.

Matters of Trust: Laws and Norms

The previous examples demonstrate that a fundamental problem facing people who would like to transact with one another concerns trust. For example, the extent to which parties trust one another shapes the sets F h and K T . If the parties do not trust one another, what could have been mutually beneficial transactions will not take place. But what grounds does a person have for trusting someone to do what he promises to do under the terms of an agreement? Such grounds can exist if promises can be made credible. Societies every where have constructed mechanisms to create credibility of this kind, but in different ways. What the mechanisms have in common, however, is that individuals who fail to comply with agreements without a good reason are punished. How does that common feature work? In Becky’s world the rules governing transactions are embodied in the law. The markets Becky’s family enters are supported by an elaborate legal structure (a public good) . Becky’s father’s firm, for example, is a legal entity; as are the financial institutions he deals with in order to accumulate his retirement pension, to save for Becky’s and Sam’s education, and so on. Even when someone in the family goes to the grocery store, the purchases (paid for with cash or by card) involve the law, which provides protection for both parties (the grocer, in case the cash is counterfeit or the card is void; the purchaser, in case the product turns out on inspection to be substandard) . The law is enforced by the coercive power of the state. Transactions involve legal contracts backed by an external enforcer, namely, the state. It is because Becky’s family and the grocery store’s owner are confident that the government has the ability and willingness to enforce contracts (i . e . , to

reasoning would be applicable to all other households, we should conclude that, for small enough values of δ, grim is an equilibrium strategy in the repeated game. But if all households play grim, then no household will ever defect. Grim can therefore function as a social norm for sustaining cooperation. Let us see how the argument works. The basic idea is simple. As all other households are assumed to be playing grim, household h would enjoy a one-period gain by defecting if its own output exceeded the average output of all households. But if h defects in any period, all other households will defect in all following periods (they are assumed to be playing grim, remember). Therefore, h’s own best option in all following periods will be to defect also, which means that subsequent to a single deviation by h, the outcome can be predicted to be pure self-sufficiency. So, set against a one-period gain that household h would enjoy if its output exceeded the average output of all households is the loss it would suffer from the following date because of the breakdown of cooperation. That loss exceeds the one-period gain if δ is small enough. So, if δ is sufficiently small, household h will not defect, but will adopt grim; implying that grim is an equilibrium strategy and equal sharing among households in every period is a social equilibrium. To formalize the above argument, we consider the situation in which h’s incentive to defect is greatest. Let A and B be the minimum and maximum possible outputs of any household. Then the maximum gain that household h could possibly enjoy from defecting at $t = 0$ arises if h happens to produce B and all other households happen to produce A. Since the average output in this eventuality is $(B + (H - 1)A)/H$ , the one-period gain that household h would enjoy from defecting is

$B + (H - 1)AW(B) - W$ / H

But h knows that if it defects, the expected loss in each subsequent period (i . e . , from t $= 1$ onward) will be E (W (X̃ h  /  H))  -  E (W (X ̃ h)). In order to simplify the notation, let us write E (W (X̃ h  /  H))  -  E (W (X ̃ h)) as L. Household h can then calculate that the expected total loss it will suffer from defecting at $t = 0$ is

$\i\text{nf tyL}^{1}(1 + δ) - t$ , which equals $L/δ$ . If this future loss exceeds the present gain from defecting, then household h will not want to defect. In other words, h will not want to defect if

$B + (H - 1)A$

L

$> W(B) - W$

δ

$H_{905}$

or

$3B + (H - 1)AW(B) - Wδ < L$ / (1)

H

But if h does not find it in its interest to defect when the one-period gain from defection is the largest possible, it will certainly not want to defect in any other situation. We conclude that if inequality ( $1$ ) holds, then grim is an equilibrium strategy and equal sharing among households in every period is a resulting social equilibrium. Notice that, as we said, this will happen if δ is sufficiently small. We usually reserve the term “society” to denote a collective that has managed to find a mutually beneficial equilibrium. Notice, however, that another social equilibrium of the repeated game is each household for itself. If everyone believed that all others would break the agreement from the start, then everyone would break the agreement from the start. Noncooperation would involve each household selecting the strategy: renege on the agreement. Failure to cooperate could be due simply to a collection of unfortunate, selfconfirming beliefs, and nothing else. It is also easy to show that noncooperation is the only social equilibrium of the repeated game if

$3B + (H - 1)AW(B) - Wδ > L$ / (2)

H

We now have in hand a tool for understanding how a community can slide from cooperative to noncooperative behavior. For example, political instability (in the extreme, civil war) can mean that households are increasingly concerned that they will be forced to disperse from their village. This translates into an increase in δ. Similarly, if households fear that their government is now bent on destroying communal institutions in order to strengthen its own authority, δ will increase. But from ( $1$ ) and ( $2$ ) we know that if δ increases sufficiently, then cooperation ceases. The model therefore offers an explanation for why, in recent decades, cooperation at the local level has declined in the unsettled regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Social norms work only when people have reasons to value the future benefits of cooperation. In the above analysis, we allowed for the possibility that, in each period, household risks were positively correlated. Moreover, the number of households in any village is typically not large. These are two reasons why Desta’s household is unable to attain anything like full insurance against the risk they face. Becky’s parents, in contrast, have access to an elaborate set of insurance markets that pool the risks of hundreds of thousands

Mathematics and Economic Reasoning

of capital markets and state pensions, male children are an essential form of investment. The transfer of resources in Desta’s household, in contrast to Becky’s, will be from the children to their parents. The under-five mortality rate in Ethiopia was, until relatively recently, in excess of $300$ per 1000 births. So, parents had to aim at large families if they were to have a reasonable chance of being looked after by a male child in their old age. But fertility is not entirely a private matter, since people are influenced by the choices of others. This gives rise to a certain inertia in household behavior even under changing circumstances, which is why even though the under-five mortality rate has fallen in Ethiopia in recent decades, Desta has five siblings. 5 High population growth has placed additional pressure on the local ecosystem, meaning that the local commons that used to be managed in a sustainable manner no longer are. That they are not is reflected in Desta’s mother’s complaint that the daily time and effort required to collect from the local commons has increased in recent years. $10$ Differences in Economic Life among Similar People In this article, I have used Becky’s and Desta’s experiences to show how it can be that the lives of essentially very similar people can become so different (for further elaboration, see Dasgupta ( 2004 )). Desta’s life is one of poverty. In her world people do not enjoy food security, do not own many assets, are stunted and wasted, do not live long (life expectancy at birth in Ethiopia is under fifty years), cannot read or write, are not empowered, cannot insure themselves well against crop failure or household calamity, do not have control over their own lives, and live in unhealthy surroundings. The deprivations reinforce one another, so that the productivity of labor effort, ideas, physical capital, and of land and natural resources are all very low and remain low. The rate of return on investment is zero, perhaps even negative (as it is with the storage of maize). Desta’s life is filled with problems each day. $5$ . See Dasgupta ( 1993 ) for the use of interdependent preferences to explain fertility behavior. In the notation of the section on social equilibria, we are to suppose that household h’s well-being has the form W h (X h , X  -  h), where one of the components of X h is the number of births in the household, and that the higher the fertility rate is among other households in the village, the larger the desired number of children in h. The theory based on interdependent preferences interprets transitions from high to low fertility rates as bifurcations. Fertility rates are expected to decline even in Ethiopia. Interdependent preferences are currently being much studied by economists (see Durlauf and Young 2001).

Becky suffers from no such deprivation (for example, life expectancy at birth in the United States is nearly eighty years). She faces what her society calls challenges. In her world, the productivity of labor effort, ideas, physical capital, and of land and natural resources are all very high and continually increasing; success in meeting each challenge reinforces the prospects of success in meeting further challenges. We have seen, however, that, despite the enormous differences between Becky’s and Desta’s lives, there is a unified way to view them, and that mathematics is an essential language for analyzing them. It is tempting to pronounce that life’s essentials cannot be reduced to mere mathematics; but in fact mathematics is essential to economic reasoning. It is essential because in economics we deal with quantifiable objects of vital interest to people. Acknowledgments. In describing Desta’s life, I have received much guidance from my colleague Pramila Krishnan.
