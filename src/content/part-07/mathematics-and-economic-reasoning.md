participant gets to know the primes that were used to produce the modulus. To decipher a message enciphered under this modulus the two participants have to collaborate--neither can achieve this on their own (Cocks 1997). A third and more amusing example is a protocol that allows Alice and Bob to replicate tossing a coin, but to do it over the telephone. Obviously, it would not be satisfactory for Alice to toss the coin and for Bob to make the call “heads” or “tails”--for how does Bob know that Alice is telling the truth about how the coin actually fell?
This problem turns out to have a simple solution. Alice and Bob choose large random sequences. Alice then appends either $a 1$ or $a 0$ to her sequence and Bob does the same for his. Alice’s extra bit represents the out come of the coin toss, and Bob’s represents his guess. Next, they send one-way hashes of their sequences (with the extra bits appended).
At this point, because of the nature of one-way hashes, neither has any idea what the other’s sequence is, so, for example, if Alice reveals her hashed sequence first, Bob cannot use this information to increase his chance of guessing correctly. Alice and Bob then exchange the unhashed sequences to see whether Bob’s guess was correct. If either does not trust the other, they can hash the other’s sequence to check that it really does give the right answer. Since it is hard to find a different sequence that gives the right answer, they can each be confident that the other has not cheated.
More complicated protocols of this type have been designed--it is even possible to play poker remotely in this way.

Becky’s World

Becky, who is ten years old, lives with her parents and an older brother Sam in a suburban town in America’s Midwest. Becky’s father works in a law firm specializing in small business enterprises. Depending on the firm’s profits, his annual income varies some what, but it is rarely below 145000 . Becky’s parents met in college. For a few years her mother worked in publishing, but when Sam was born she decided to concentrate on raising a family. Now that both Becky and Sam attend school, she does voluntary work in local education. The family live in a two-story house.
It has four bedrooms, two bathrooms upstairs and a toilet downstairs, a large drawing-cum-dining room, a modern kitchen, and a family room in the basement. There is a small plot of land in the rear, which the family use for leisure activities. Although they have a partial mortgage on their property, Becky’s parents own stocks and bonds and have a savings account in the local branch of a national bank. Becky’s father and his firm jointly contribute to his retirement pension. He also makes monthly payments into a scheme with the bank that will cover college education for Becky and Sam.
The family’s assets and their lives are insured. Becky’s parents often remark that, federal taxes being high, they have to be careful with

$896$

money; and they are. Nevertheless, they own two cars, the children attend camp each summer, and the family take a vacation together once camp is over. Becky’s parents also remark that her generation will be much more prosperous than they. Becky wants to save the environment and insists on biking to school each day. Her ambition is to become a doctor.

Desta’s World

Desta, who is about ten years old, lives with her parents and five siblings in a village in subtropical, southwest Ethiopia. The family live in a two-room, grass-roofed mud hut. Desta’s father grows maize and tef on half a hectare of land that the government has awarded him. Desta’s older brother helps him to farm the land and care for the household’s livestock: a cow, a goat, and a few chickens. The small quantity of tef produced is sold so as to raise cash income, but the maize is largely consumed by the household as a staple.
Desta’s mother works a small plot next to their cottage, growing cabbage, onions, and enset (a year-round root crop that also serves as a staple). In order to supplement household income, she brews a local drink made from maize. As she is also responsible for cooking, cleaning, and minding the infants, her work day usually lasts fourteen hours. Despite the long hours, it would not be possible for her to complete the tasks on her own.
(As the ingredients are all raw, cooking alone takes five hours or more .) So Desta and her older sister help their mother with household chores and mind their younger siblings. Although a younger brother at tends the local school, neither Desta nor her older sister has ever been enrolled there. Her parents can neither read nor write, but they are numerate. Desta’s home has no electricity or running water. Around where they live, sources of water, land for grazing cattle, and the woodlands are communal property. They are shared by people in Desta’s village;
but the villagers do not allow outsiders to make use of them. Each day Desta’s mother and the girls fetch water, collect fuelwood, and pick berries and herbs from the local commons. Desta’s mother frequently observes that the time and effort needed to collect their daily needs has increased over the years. There is no financial institution nearby to offer either credit or insurance. As funerals are expensive occasions, Desta’s father long ago joined a community insurance scheme (iddir) to which he contributes monthly.
When Desta’s father purchased the cow they now own, he used the entire cash he had accumulated

VII. The Influence of Mathematics

and stored at home, but had to supplement that with funds borrowed from kinfolk, with a promise to repay the debt when he had the ability to do so. In turn, when they are in need, his kinfolk come to him for a loan, which he supplies if he is able to. Desta’s father says that such patterns of reciprocity he and those close to him practice are part of their culture, reflecting their norms of social conduct. He also says that his sons are his main assets, as they are the ones who will look after him and Desta’s mother in their old age.
Economic statisticians estimate that, adjusting for differences in the cost of living between Ethiopia and the United States, Desta’s family income is about 5000 per year, of which 1000 is attributable to the products they draw from the local commons. However, as rainfall varies from year to year, Desta’s family income fluctuates widely. In bad years, the grain they store at home gets depleted well before the next harvest. Food is then so scarce that they all grow weaker, the younger children especially so. It is only after harvest that they regain their weight and strength.
Periodic hunger and illnesses have meant that Desta and her siblings are some what stunted. Over the years Desta’s parents have lost two children in their in fancy, stricken by malaria in one case and diarrhea in the other. There have also been several miscarriages. Desta knows that she will be married (in all likelihood to a farmer, like her father) when she reaches eighteen and will then live on her husband’s land in a neighboring village. She expects her life to be similar to that of her mother.

The Economist’s Agenda

That the lives people are able to construct differ enormously across the globe is a commonplace. In our age of travel, it is even a common sight. That Becky and Desta face widely different futures is also something we have come to expect, perhaps also to accept. Nevertheless, it may not be out of turn to imagine that the two girls are intrinsically very similar: they both enjoy eating, playing, and gossiping; they are close to their families; they like pretty things to wear; and they both have the capacity to be disappointed, get annoyed, be happy. Their parents are also alike.
They are knowledgeable about the ways of their worlds. They also care about their families, finding ingenious ways to meet the recurring problem of producing income and allocating resources among family members--over time and allowing for unexpected contingencies. So, a promising

route for exploring the underlying causes behind their vastly different conditions of life would be to begin by observing that the constraints the families face are very different: that in some sense Desta’s family are far more restricted in what they are able to be and do than Becky’s. Economics in large measure tries to uncover the processes that influence how people’s lives come to be what they are. The context may be a household, a village, a district, a state, a country, or the whole world.
In its remaining measure, the discipline tries to identify ways to influence those very processes so as to improve the prospects of those who are hugely constrained in what they can be and do. Modern economics, by which I mean the style of economics taught and practiced in today’s graduate schools, does the exercises from the ground up: from individuals, through the household, village, district, state, country, to the whole world. In varying degrees the millions of individual decisions shape the eventualities people all face;
as both theory and evidence tell us that there are enormous numbers of unintended consequences of what we all do. But there is also a feedback, in that those consequences go on to shape what people subsequently can do and choose to do. For example, when Becky’s family drive their cars or use electricity, or when Desta’s family create compost or burn wood for cooking, they contribute to global carbon emissions.
Their contributions are no doubt negligible, but the millions of such tiny contributions cumulatively sum to a sizable amount, having consequences that people every where are likely to experience in different ways. To understand Becky’s and Desta’s lives, we need first of all to identify the prospects they face for transforming goods and services into further goods and services--now and in the future, under various contingencies.
Second, we need to uncover the character of their choices and the pathways by which the choices made by millions of households like Becky’s and Desta’s go to produce the prospects they all face. Third, and relatedly, we need to uncover the pathways by which the families came to inherit their current circumstances. The last of these is the stuff of economic history.
In studying history we could, should we feel bold, take the long view--from about the time agriculture came to be settled practice in the Fertile Crescent (roughly , Anatolia) some eleven thousand years ago--and try to explain why the many innovations and practices that have cumulatively contributed to the making of

$897$

Becky’s world either did not reach or did not take hold in Desta’s part of the world. (Diamond ( 1997 ) is an enquiry into this set of questions .) If we wanted a sharper account, we could study, say, the past six hundred years and ask how it is that, instead of the several regions in Eurasia that were economically promising in about 1400 c.e., it was the unlikely northern Europe that made it and helped to create Becky’s world, even while by passing Desta’s. (Landes ( 1998 ) is an inquiry into that question.
Fogel ( 2004 ) explores the pathways by which Europe during the past three hundred years has escaped permanent hunger .) As modern economics is largely concerned with the first two sets of enquiries, this article focuses on them. However, the methods that today’s economic historians deploy to answer their questions are not dissimilar to the ones I describe below to study contemporary lives. The methods involve studying individual and collective choices in terms of maximization exercises. The predictions of the theories are then tested by studying data relating to actual behavior.
Even the ethical foundations of national economic policies involve maximization exercises: the maximization of social well-being subject to constraints. (The treatise that codified this approach to economic reasoning was Samuelson ( 1947 ).)

The Household Maximization Problem

Both Becky’s and Desta’s households are microeconomies. Each subscribes to particular arrangements over who does what and when, recognizing that it faces constraints on what its members are capable of doing. We imagine that both sets of parents have their families’ well-being in mind and want to do as well as they can to protect and promote it. 1 Of course, both Becky’s and Desta’s parents would have a wider notion of what constitutes their families than I have allowed here. Maintaining ties with kinfolk would be an important aspect of their lives, a matter I return to later.
One also imagines that Becky’s and Desta’s parents are interested in their future grandchildren’s well-being. But as they recognize that their children will in turn care about their children, they are right to conclude by recursion that doing the best for their children amounts to doing the best for their grandchildren, for their great grandchildren, and so on, down the generations. $1$ . As suggested by Mc Elroy and Horney in 1981 , a realistic alternative would be to suppose that household decisions are reached by negotiation between the various parties (see Dasgupta 1993 , chapter $11$ ) .
Qualitatively, nothing much is lost in my assuming optimizing households here.

   Personal well-being is made up of a variety of con-
stituents: health, relationships, place in society, and
satisfaction at work are but four. Economists and psy-
chologists have identified ways to represent well-being
as a numerical measure. To say that some one’s well-
being is greater in situation Y than in situation Z is to     a point in RM —the Euclidean space of M dimensions.
say that her well-being measure is numerically higher
in Y than in Z. A family’s well-being is an aggregate
of its members’ well-beings. As goods and services are
among the determinants of well-being (some important
examples are food, shelter, clothing, and medical care),
the problem that both Becky’s and Desta’s parents face
is to determine, from among those allocations of goods
and services that are feasible, the ones that are best
for their households. However, both pairs of parents
care not only about today, but also about the future.
More over, the future is uncertain. So when the parents
think about which goods and services their households
should consume, they are concerned not just with the
goods and services themselves, but also with when they
will be consumed (food today, food tomorrow, and so
on) and what will happen in the case of various contin-
gencies (food the day after tomorrow if rainfall turns
out to be bad tomorrow, and so forth). Implicitly or
explicitly, both sets of parents convert their experience
and knowledge into probabilistic judgments. Some of
the probabilities they attach to contingencies are no
doubt very subjective, but others, such as their pre-
dictions about the weather, are arrived at from long
experience.
   In subsequent sections we shall study the way in
which Becky’s and Desta’s parents allocate goods and
services across time and contingencies. But here we
shall keep the exposition simple and consider a model
that is static and deterministic. That is, we shall pretend   tify a smaller set, F , of “actually feasible” values of Y .
that the people live in a time less world, and that they
are completely certain about all the information they
need in order to make their decisions.
   Suppose that a certain household has N members,
whom we label 1, 2, . . . , N. Let us think about how we
can appropriately model the well-being of household
member i. As has already been mentioned, well-being
is taken to be a real number that depends in some way
on the goods and services consumed and supplied by i.
It is traditional to divide goods and services into those     assume that the sets J and F are both closed and
consumed and those supplied, and to use positive num-
bers to represent quantities of the former and negative
numbers for the latter. Imagine now that there are M
commodities in all. Let Yi (j) represent the quantity of
the jth commodity that is consumed or supplied by i.

VII. The Influence of Mathematics
By our convention, Yi (j) > 0 if j is consumed by i
(e.g., food eaten or clothing worn) and Yi (j) < 0 if j
is supplied by i (e.g., labor). Now consider the vector
Yi = (Yi (1), . . . , Yi (M)). It denotes the quantities of all
the goods and services consumed or supplied by i. Yi is
We now let Ui (Yi ) denote i’s well-being. Let us assume
that supplying goods and services decreases i’s well-
being, while consuming them increases it. Because the
goods that are supplied by i are measured as nega-
tive quantities, we can justifiably assume that Ui (Yi )
increases as any of its components Yi increases.
The next step is to generalize the model to one
that applies to an entire household. The individual
well-beings of the members of the household can
be collected together so that they themselves form
an N-dimensional vector, (U1 (Y1 ), . . . , UN (YN )). The
household’s well-being is dependent in some way on
this vector. That is, we say that the well-being of the
household is W (U1 (Y1 ), . . . , UN (YN )), for some func-
tion W . (Utilitarian philosophers have argued that W is
simply the sum of the Ui .) We also make the natural
assumption that W is an increasing function of each Ui
(which is certainly the case if W is the sum of the Ui ).
Let Y denote the sequence (Y1 , . . . , YN ). Y is a point in
the NM-dimensional Euclidean space RNM . It can also
be thought of as the matrix you obtain if you make
a table of the amounts of each commodity consumed
or supplied by each member of the household. Now,
it is clear that not every Y in RNM can actually occur:
after all, the total amount of any given commodity (in
the whole world, say) is finite. So we assume that Y
belongs to a certain set J, which we regard as the set
of all potentially feasible values of Y . Within J we iden-
This is the set of values of Y from which the household
could in principle choose. It is smaller than J because of
constraints that the household faces, such as the max-
imum amount of income it can earn. F is the house-
hold’s feasible set.2 The decision faced by a household
is to choose Y from the feasible set F so as to maximize
its well-being W (U1 (Y1 ), . . . , UN (YN )). This is called the
household maximization problem.
It is reasonable, and mathematically convenient, to
bounded subsets of RNM , and that the well-being func-
tion W is continuous. Since every continuous function
2. Presently we will see why we need to distinguish J from F , rather
than looking just at F .

VII.8.   Mathematics and Economic Reasoning

on a closed bounded set has a maximum, it follows that
the household maximization problem has a solution.
If, in addition, W is differentiable, the theory of non-
linear programming can be used to identify the opti-
mality conditions the household’s choice must satisfy.
If F is a convex set and W is a concave function of Y ,
those conditions are both necessary and sufficient. The
lagrange multipliers [III.64](/part-03/optimization-and-lagrange-multipliers) associated with F can
be interpreted as notional prices: they reflect the worth
to the household of slightly relaxing the constraints.
   Let us conduct an exercise to test the power of the
modern economist’s way of studying choice. First, let
us assume that W is a symmetric and concave function
of the individual well-beings Ui (as would be the case
if W were the sum of the Ui ). The symmetry assump-
tion means that if two individuals exchange their well-
beings, then W is unchanged; and concavity means,
roughly speaking, that, other things being equal, as a
Ui increases, the rate of increase of W does not rise.
Let us suppose in addition that the household members
are identical: that is, let us set all the functions Ui to be
equal to a single function, U , say. Assume also that U is
a strictly concave function of the Yi , which means that
the rate of increase of well-being declines as consump-
tion increases. Finally, assume that the feasible set F is
nonempty, convex, and symmetric. (Symmetry means
that if some Y is feasible, and the vector Z is the same
as Y except that the consumptions of a pair of indi-
vi duals in the household have been exchanged, then
Z is also feasible.) From these assumptions it can be
shown that members of the household would be treated
equally: that is, W is maximized when they all receive
the same bundle of goods and services.
   At low levels of consumption, however, the hypoth-
esis that the function U is concave is unreasonable.
To see why, we should note that, typically, 60–75%
of the daily energy intake of some one in nutritional
balance goes toward maintenance, while the remaining
25–40% is expended in discretionary activities (work
and leisure). The 60–75% is rather like a fixed cost:
over the long run a person needs it as a minimum
no matter what he or she does. The simplest way
to uncover the implications of such fixed costs is to
continue to suppose that F is convex (which is the
case, for example, if there is a fixed quantity of food
for allocation among members of the household), but
that U is a strictly convex function at low in takes of
food and a strictly concave function there after. It is
not hard to show that a poor household in such a
world will maximize its well-being by allocating food

899
unequally among its members, while a rich household
can afford the luxury of equal treatment and will
choose to distribute food equally. Suppose, to take
a very stylized example, that energy requirement for
daily maintenance is 1500 kcal and that a household
of four can obtain at most 5000 kcal for consumption.
Then equal sharing would mean that no one would
have sufficient energy for any work, so it is better to
share the food unequally. On the other hand, if the
household is able to obtain more than 6000 kcal, it can
share the food equally with out jeopardizing its future.
There are empirical correlates of this finding. When
food is very scarce, the younger and weaker members
of Desta’s household are given less to eat than the
others, even after allowance is made for differences in
their ages. In good times, though, Desta’s parents can
afford to be egalitarian. In contrast, Becky’s household
can always afford enough food. Her parents therefore
allocate food equally every day.
4   Social Equilibrium
Household transactions in Becky’s world are carried out
mostly in markets. The terms of trade are the quoted
market prices. In developing a mathematical con struc-
tion of social out comes, I continue to imagine, for sim-
plicity, a static, deterministic world. Let P (⩾ 0) be the
vector of market prices and let M (⩾ 0) be the vector
of a household’s endowments of goods and services.
(That is, for each commodity j, P (j) is the price of j
and M(j) is the amount of j that the household already
has.) Recalling our convention that goods consumed
are of positive sign and goods supplied are of nega-
                   
tive sign, define X = Yi . (Thus, X(j) = Yi (j) is the
total amount of commodity j that is consumed by the
household.) Then P · X is the total price of goods con-
sumed by the household, minus the total price of goods
supplied, and P·M is the total value of its endowments.
The feasible set F is the set of household choices Y that
satisfy the “budget” constraint P · (X − M) ⩽ 0.
The income that Becky’s household earns from the
assets it supplies to the market is determined by mar-
ket prices (Becky’s father’s salary, interest rates on
bank deposits, returns on shares owned). Those prices
in turn depend on the size and distribution of house-
hold endowments of goods and services and on house-
hold needs and preferences. They depend too on the
ability and willingness of institutions, such as private
firms and the government, to make use of the rights
they in turn have been awarded. These functional rela-
tion ships explain why Becky’s father’s skills as a lawyer

(itself an asset, termed “human capital” by economists)     (See below in our discussion of insurance arrangements
would not be worth much in Desta’s village, even
though they are much valued in the United States. In
fact, it was a firm belief that lawyers would continue
to prove valuable in the United States that encouraged
Becky’s father to be a lawyer.
   Although Desta’s household does operate in mar-
kets (when her father sells tef or her mother sells the     terms in which households are able to negotiate with
liquor she has brewed), it under takes many trans ac-
tions directly with nature; in the local commons and
in farming, and in nonmarket relationships with oth-
ers in the village. Therefore the F that Desta’s house-     For ease of exposition, I shall suppose that a house-
hold faces is not defined simply by a linear budget
inequality, as in the idealized model we have con-
struc ted to display Becky’s world, but also reflects the     regarding how this consumption is distributed among
constraints that nature imposes, such as soil produc-
tivity and rainfall, the assets it has access to, and the
terms and conditions involving transactions with oth-
ers in the village via nonmarket relationships, a mat-
ter I come to later. The constraints imposed by nature
are felt by Becky’s household too, but through market
prices. For example, should a drought lead to a fall in
world cereal production, it would become noticeable
to Becky’s household through the high price of cereal.
Desta’s household, in contrast, would notice it directly
from the reduced harvest from their field.
   Desta’s household assets include the family home,
livestock, agricultural implements, and their half hect-
are of land. The skills Desta’s family members have
accumulated in farming, managing livestock, and col-
lecting resources from the local commons are part
of their human capital. Those skills do not command
much return in the global marketplace, but they do
shape the household’s feasible set F and are vital to the   mum choice depends on h’s beliefs about X−h and the

from their parents and grandparents, just as Desta and
her siblings have learned them from their parents and
grandparents. Desta’s family can also be said to own a
portion of the local commons: in effect, her household
shares its ownership with others in the village. Diff i cul-    avoid that route. So as to anchor their investigation,
ties in reaching and enforcing agreement with neigh-
bors over the use of the local commons are less severe
than they are in the case of global commons, such as
the atmosphere as a sink for carbon emissions. This
is not only because the required negotiations involve
far fewer people when the commons are local, but also
because there is likely to be greater congruence of opin-   sequence (X1∗ , . . . , XH
ions and interests among the users. It helps too that the   a social equilibrium if, for every h, the choice Xh∗ of
parties are able to observe whether the agreements they     household h maximizes the well-being Wh (Xh ) over all
made over the use of local commons are being kept.

in Desta’s world.)
Thus, the choices that are available to individuals are
affected by the choices that other people make: this
results in feedback. In a market economy, the feed-
back is in large part transmitted in prices. In nonmar-
ket economies the feedback is transmitted through the
one another.
Let us try to model this situation mathematically.
We start by imagining an economy of H households.
hold’s well-being can be expressed directly in terms of
its aggregate consumption of goods and services, dis-
the individual members. Let Xh denote the consump-
tion vector in household h (with the usual sign conven-
tion), let Jh be the set of potentially feasible vectors Xh ,
and let Wh (Xh ) be h’s well-being.
Within h’s potentially feasible set Jh of consump-
tion vectors lies the actual feasible set Fh . In order
to model the feedback we shall explicitly recognize
that Fh depends on the consumptions of other house-
holds. That is, it is a function of the sequence (X1 , . . . ,
Xh−1 , Xh+1 , . . . , XH ). To save space, we shall denote
this sequence, which consists of every household’s
consumption vector except h’s, by X−h . Formally, Fh
is a function (some times called a “correspondence”)
that takes objects of the form X−h to subsets of Jh .
Household h’s economic problem is to choose its con-
sumption Xh from its feasible set Fh (X−h ) in such a
way as to maximize its well-being Wh (Xh ). The opti-
Meanwhile, all other households are making simi-
lar calculations. How can we unravel the feedbacks?
One way would be to ask people to disclose their
beliefs about the feedbacks. Fortunately, economists
economists study equilibrium beliefs; that is, beliefs
that are self-confirming. The idea is to identify states
of affairs where the choices people make on the basis
of their beliefs about the feedbacks are precisely those
that give rise to those very feedbacks. We call any
such state of affairs a social equilibrium. Formally, a

   This raises an obvious question: does a social equ i lib-    is reasonable to limit such a study by considering

in 1952 showed that, under a fairly general set of con-

ditions for the existence of social equilibria (which
allow the feasible set Fh (X−h ) to be nonconvex) have
been explored in recent years.
   In Becky’s world, a social equilibrium is called a mar-    of national security on offer to you is the same as that
ket equilibrium. A market equilibrium is a price vec-
tor P ∗ (⩾ 0) and a consumption vector Xh∗ for each
household h, such that Xh∗ maximizes Wh (Xh ) subject
to the budget constraint P ∗ · (Xh − Mh ) ⩽ 0, and such
that the demands for goods and services across house-
holds are feasible (i.e., (Xh − Mh ) ⩽ 0). That market
equilibria are social equilibria, in the sense in which we    quantity of a public good as a number G, and the quan-
have defined the latter term here, was demonstrated by
Arrow and Debreu in 1954. Debreu (1959) is the defini-
tive treatise on market equilibria. In that book, Debreu
followed the leads of Erik Lindahl and Kenneth J. Arrow,
by distinguishing goods and services not only in terms
of their physical characteristics, but also in terms of
the date and contingency in which they appear. Later
in this article we shall expand the commodity space in
that way to study savings and insurance decisions in
both Becky’s and Desta’s worlds.
   One cannot automatically assume that a social equi-
lib rium is just or collectively good. More over, except
for the most artificial examples, social equilibrium is
not unique—which means that a study of equilibria
per se leaves open the question of which social equi-
lib rium we should expect to observe. In order to probe
that question, economists study disequilibrium behav-
ior and analyze the stability properties of the result-
ing dynamic processes. The basic idea is to hypoth-
esize about the way people form beliefs about the
way the world works, track the consequences of those
patterns of learning, and check them against data. It

equilibrium in stationary environments. Initial beliefs

5   Public Policy
Economists distinguish between what they call private
goods and public goods. For many goods, consumption
is rivalrous: if you consume a bit more from a given sup-
less to consume. These are private goods. The way to
assess their consumption through out the economy is to
add up the amounts consumed by all individual house-
holds; which is what we did in the previous section
when arriving at the notion of a social equilibrium. Not
all goods are like that, however. For example, the extent
on offer to all households in your country. In a just soci-
ety the law has that same property, as has the state: not
only is consumption not rivalrous, but in addition, no
one can be prevented from availing himself or herself
of the entire amount available in the economy. Public

goods are goods of this second kind. One models the
tity Gh consumed by each household h is deemed to
equal G. An example of a public good that has a global
coverage is the Earth’s atmosphere: the whole world
benefits from it jointly.
If the supply of public goods is left to private indi-
vi duals, then problems arise. For example, even though
every one in a city would benefit from a cleaner, health-
ier environment, individuals have a strong incentive
to free-ride on others when it comes to paying for
that cleaner environment. Samuelson showed in 1954
that such a situation resembles the prisoner’s dilemma:
each party has a strategy that is best for him/her,
regard less of what strategies the other parties choose,
even though there is another set of strategies, one per
party, that is better for everybody. Under such circum-
st ances, one usually needs public measures, such as
taxes and subsidies, in order for it to be in the interest
of private individuals to act in a way that implements
the collectively preferred out comes. In other words, the
dilemma can be expected to be resolved effectively not
by markets but by politics. It is widely accepted in polit-
ical theory that government should be charged with

$902$

imposing taxes, subsidies, and transfers, and should be engaged in supplying public goods. The government is also the natural agency to supply infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and electrical cables, requiring as they do investments that are huge in comparison with individual in comes. We shall now extend our earlier model to include public goods and infrastructure, so that we can study the government’s economic task. Let us assume that social well-being is a numerical aggregate of household well-beings. Thus, if V is social well-being, we write it as V ($W^{1}$ , . . . , W H).
It is natural to postulate that V increases as any W h increases. (One example of such a function V is the one prescribed by utilitarian philosophy, namely, $W^{1} +$ · · · $+ W^{H}$ .) The government chooses what quantities to supply of the various public goods and infrastructure commodities. These numbers can be modeled by two vectors, which we will call G and I, respectively. The government also chooses to impose on each household h certain transfers T h of goods and services (for example, providing health care and charging income tax). Let us write T for the sequence ($T^{1}$ , . . .
, T H). Whether or not a particular choice of vectors G and I is actually feasible for the government will depend on T , so we define K T to be the set of feasible pairs of vectors (G , I), given the choice of T . Because we have introduced a new set of goods, we shall have to modify the household well-being functions by enlarging their domains. The obvious notation to express this extra dependence is to write W h (X h , G, I, T h) for the well-being of household h. More over, h’s feasible set F h now also depends on G, I, and T h ;
so we write the set of feasible household choices as F h (G , I, T h , X  -  h). To try to determine the optimum public policy, imagine a two-stage game. The government has the first move, choosing T and then G and I from K T . Households go second, reacting to decisions made by the government. Imagine that a social equilibrium ∗ X ∗  =  ($X^{1}$ ∗ , . . . , X H ) is reached and that the equilibrium is unique. (We assume that if there are multiple equilibria, the government can select among them by resorting to public signals .) Clearly, this equilibrium X ∗ is a function of G, I, and T .
An intelligent and benevolent government will anticipate it and choose T , G, and I from K T in such a way as to maximize the resulting ∗ social well-being V (W ($X^{1}$ ∗), . . . , W (X H )). The public policy problem we have just designed, involving as it does a double optimization, is technically very difficult. It transpires, for example, that even

VII. The Influence of Mathematics

in some of the simplest model economies one can imagine, F h (G , I, T h , X  -  h) is not convex. This means that the social equilibrium cannot be guaranteed to depend continuously on G, I, and T , as was shown by Mirrlees in 1984 . This in turn means that standard techniques are not suitable for the government’s optimization problem. In fact, of course, even “double optimization” is a huge simplification. The government chooses; people respond by trading, producing, consuming; the government chooses again;
people respond once again--and so forth in an unending series of moves and countermoves. Identifying the optimum public policy involves severe computational difficulties.

Matters of Trust: Laws and Norms

The previous examples demonstrate that a fundamental problem facing people who would like to transact with one another concerns trust. For example, the extent to which parties trust one another shapes the sets F h and K T . If the parties do not trust one another, what could have been mutually beneficial transactions will not take place. But what grounds does a person have for trusting some one to do what he promises to do under the terms of an agreement? Such grounds can exist if promises can be made credible.
Societies every where have constructed mechanisms to create credibility of this kind, but in different ways. What the mechanisms have in common, however, is that individuals who fail to comply with agreements with out a good reason are punished. How does that common feature work? In Becky’s world the rules governing transactions are embodied in the law. The markets Becky’s family enters are supported by an elaborate legal structure (a public good) . Becky’s father’s firm, for example, is a legal entity;
as are the financial institutions he deals with in order to accumulate his retirement pension, to save for Becky’s and Sam’s education, and so on. Even when some one in the family goes to the grocery store, the purchases (paid for with cash or by card) involve the law, which provides protection for both parties (the grocer, in case the cash is counterfeit or the card is void; the purchaser, in case the product turns out on inspection to be substandard) . The law is enforced by the coercive power of the state.
Transactions involve legal contracts backed by an external enforcer, namely, the state. It is because Becky’s family and the grocery store’s owner are confident that the government has the ability and willingness to enforce contracts (i . e . , to

VII.8.   Mathematics and Economic Reasoning

continue to supply the public good in question) that
they are willing to make transactions.
   What is the basis of that confidence? After all, the
contemporary world has shown that there are states
and there are states. Why should Becky’s family trust
the government to carry out its tasks in an honest man-
ner? A possible answer is that the government in her
country worries about its reputation: a free and inquis-
itive press in a democracy helps to sober the govern-
ment into believing that incompetence or malfeasance
would mean an end to its rule come the next election.
Notice how the argument involves a system of inter-
locking beliefs about the abilities and intentions of oth-    rule if all others act in accordance with it. Social norms
ers. The millions of households in Becky’s country trust
their government (more or less!) to enforce contracts,
because they know that government leaders know that
not to enforce contracts efficiently would mean being
thrown out of office. In their turn, each party to a con-
tract trusts the other to refrain from reneging (again,
more or less!), because each knows that the other knows
that the government can be trusted to enforce con-
tracts. And so on. Trust is maintained by the threat
of punishment (a fine, a jail term, dismissal, or what-
ever) for anyone who breaks a contract. Once again, we
are in the realm of equilibrium beliefs, held together
by their own bootstraps. Mutual trust encourages peo-
ple to seek out mutually beneficial transactions and
engage in them. As the formal argument that supports
the above claim is very similar to the one showing
that social norms contain mechanisms for enforcing
agreements, we turn to the place of social norms in
people’s lives.
  Although the law of contracts exists also in Desta’s
country, her family cannot depend on it because the
nearest courts are far from their village. More over,
there are no lawyers in sight. As transport is enor-
mously costly, economic life is shaped out side a for-
mal legal system. In short, crucial public goods and
infrastructure are either unavailable, or, at best, in
short supply. But even though there is no external
enforcer, Desta’s parents do make transactions with
others. Credit (not dissimilar to insurance in her village)
involves saying, “I will lend to you now if you promise
to repay me when you can.” Saving for funerals involves
saying, “I agree to abide by the terms and conditions of
the iddir.” And so on. But why should the parties have
any confidence that the agreements will not be broken?
 Such confidence can be justified if agreements are
mutually enforced. The basic idea is this: a credible

903
threat by members of a community that stiff sanc-
tions will be imposed on anyone who breaks an agree-
ment can deter every one from breaking it. The problem
is then to make the threat credible. In Desta’s world
credibility is achieved by recourse to social norms of
behavior.
By a social norm we mean a rule of behavior followed
by members of a community. A rule of behavior (or
“strategy” in economic parlance) reads like, “I will do
X if you do Y,” “I will do P if Q happens,” and so forth.
For a rule of behavior to be a social norm, it must be in
the interest of every one to act in accordance with the
are equilibrium rules of behavior. We will now see how
social norms work and how transactions based on them
compare with market-based transactions. To do this we
will study insurance as a commodity.
7   Insurance
To insure one self against a risk is to act in ways
to reduce that risk. (Formally, a random variable
[III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) X̃ is said to be riskier than a random vari-
able Ỹ if there is a random variable Z̃ with zero mean
such that X̃ has the same distribution as Ỹ + Z̃. In
this case, X̃ and Ỹ have the same mean but X̃ is more
“spread out.”) As long as it does not cost too much, risk-
averse households will want to reduce risk by purchas-
ing insurance: in fact, avoiding risk would seem to be a
universal urge. To formalize these notions, consider an
isolated village, such as Desta’s. Suppose for simplicity
that it contains H identical households. If household
h’s food consumption is Xh (represented by a single
real number), let us say that its well-being is W (Xh ).
We shall assume that W (Xh ) > 0 (that is, more food
leads to greater well-being) and that W (Xh ) < 0 (the
more food you already have, the less you benefit from
yet more). We shall confirm below that the second prop-
erty of W , its strict concavity, implies, and is implied
by, risk a version; but the basic reason is simple: if W is
strictly concave, then you gain less when you are lucky
than you lose when you are unlucky.
For simplicity, let us suppose that the production of
food by a household h, which is subject to chance fac-
tors such as the weather, involves no effort. Since the
output is uncertain, we represent it by a random vari-
able X̃h , with expected value μ, which is assumed to be
positive. We shall denote expectations by E.
If a household h is completely self-sufficient, then its
expected well-being is simply E(W (X̃h )). However, the

904

strict concavity of W implies that W (μ) > E(W (X̃h )). To
put this in words: h’s well-being at the average level of
production is greater than the expectation of h’s well-
being if the production is random. This means that h
will prefer a sure level of consumption to a risky one
with mean equal to that sure level. In short, h is risk
averse. Define a number . ar{\mu} by W (. ar{\mu}) = E(W (X̃h )). So . ar{\mu}
is the level of production that achieves the expected
well-being. This will be less than μ, and so μ − . ar{\mu} is a
measure of the cost of the risk that a self-sufficient
household bears. Notice that the greater the “curva-
ture” of W is, the greater the cost is of the risk asso-
ciated with X̃h . (A useful measure of curvature turns
out to be −XW (X)/W (X). We will make use of this
measure when discussing intertemporal choices.) To
see how households could gain by pooling their risks,
let us write X̃h = μ + ε̃h , where ε̃h is a random vari-
able with mean zero, variance σ 2 , and finite support.
Suppose for simplicity that the random variables ε̃h
are identical (i.e., they do not depend on h). Let the
correlation coefficient of any two of these dis tr ibu-
tions be ρ. It turns out that, as long as ρ < 1, house-
holds can reduce their risks by agreeing to share their
outputs. Suppose that households are able to observe
one another’s outputs. Given that the random variables
X̃h are identical, the obvious insurance scheme is to
share out the outputs equally. Under this scheme, h’s
uncertain food consumption becomes the average of
X̃1 , . . . , X̃H , which is an improvement on self-sufficiency
because E(W ( X̃h /H)) > E(W (X̃h )). The problem is
that, with out an enforcement mechanism, the agree-
ment to share will not stick, because once each house-
hold knows how much food every household has pro-
duced, all but the unluckiest households will wish to
renege. To see why, notice first that the luckiest house-
holds will renege because their outputs are above the
average; but this means that the next luckiest set of
households will renege because their outputs are above
the reduced average; and so on, down to the unlucki-
est households. Since households know in advance that
this will happen if there are no enforcement mecha-
nisms, they will not enter the scheme in the first place:
the only social equilibrium is pure self-sufficiency and
there is no pooling of risk.
   Let us call the insurance game just described the
stage game. Although pure self-sufficiency is the only
social equilibrium for the stage game, we shall now see
that the situation changes if the game is played repeat-
edly. To model this, let us use the letter t to denote
time, and let us take time to be a nonnegative integer.

VII. The Influence of Mathematics
(The game might, for instance, take place every year,
with 0 standing for the current year.) Let us assume
that the villagers face the same set of risks in each
time period, and that the risk in one year is indepen-
dent of the risks in all other years. Also assume that,
in each period, once food outputs are realized, house-
holds decide independently of one another whether
they will abide by the agreement to share their produce
equally or whether they will renege on it.
Although future well-being is important to a house-
hold, it will typically be less important than present
well-being. To model this we introduce a positive
parameter δ, which measures how much a household
discounts its future well-being. The assumption is that,
when making calculations at t = 0, a household divides
its well-being at time t by a factor (1 + δ)t : that is,
the importance decays by a certain fixed percentage
at each time period. We shall now show that, provided
δ is sufficiently small (i.e., provided that households
care enough about their future well-being), there is a
social equilibrium in which households abide by the
agreement to share their aggregate output equally.
Let Ỹh (t) be the uncertain amount of food avail-
able to household h at time t. If all households are
participating in the agreement, then Ỹh (t) will be

μ + ( ε̃h )/H, and if there is no agreement, then it
will be μ + ε̃h . At time t = 0 the total expected
well-being of household h, present and future, is
. nfty                        t
                                           0 E(W (Ỹh (t)))/(1 + δ) . (To calculate this we took,
for each t ⩾ 0, the expected well-being of h at time
t and divided it by (1 + δ)t . Then we added these
numbers up.)
Now consider the following simple strategy that h
might adopt: it begins by participating in the insur-
ance scheme and continues to participate so long as no
household has reneged on the agreement; but it with-
draws from the scheme from the date following the first
violation of the agreement by some household. Game
theorists have christened this the “grim strategy,” or
simply grim, because of its unforgiving nature. Let us
see how grim could support the original agreement to
share aggregate output equally at every date. (For a gen-
eral account of repeated games and the variety of social
norms that can sustain agreements, see Fudenberg and
Maskin (1986).)
Suppose that household h believes that all other
households have chosen grim. Then h knows that none
of the other households will be the first to defect. What
should h do then? We will show that if δ is small
enough, h can do no better than play grim. As the same

VII . $8$ .

Mathematics and Economic Reasoning

reasoning would be applicable to all other households, we should conclude that, for small enough values of δ, grim is an equilibrium strategy in the repeated game. But if all households play grim, then no household will ever defect. Grim can therefore function as a social norm for sustaining cooperation. Let us see how the argument works. The basic idea is simple. As all other households are assumed to be playing grim, household h would enjoy a one-period gain by defecting if its own output exceeded the average output of all households.
But if h defects in any period, all other households will defect in all following periods (they are assumed to be playing grim, remember). Therefore, h’s own best option in all following periods will be to defect also, which means that subsequent to a single deviation by h, the out come can be predicted to be pure self-sufficiency. So, set against a one-period gain that household h would enjoy if its output exceeded the average output of all households is the loss it would suffer from the following date because of the breakdown of cooperation.
That loss exceeds the one-period gain if δ is small enough. So, if δ is sufficiently small, household h will not defect, but will adopt grim; implying that grim is an equilibrium strategy and equal sharing among households in every period is a social equilibrium. To formalize the above argument, we consider the situation in which h’s incentive to defect is greatest. Let A and B be the minimum and maximum possible outputs of any household.
Then the maximum gain that household h could possibly enjoy from defecting at $t = 0$ arises if h happens to produce B and all other households happen to produce A. Since the average output in this eventuality is $(B + (H - 1)A)/H$ , the one-period gain that household h would enjoy from defecting is

$B + (H - 1)AW(B) - W$ / H

But h knows that if it defects, the expected loss in each subsequent period (i . e . , from t $= 1$ onward) will be E (W (X̃ h  /  H))  -  E (W (X ̃ h)). In order to simplify the notation, let us write E (W (X̃ h  /  H))  -  E (W (X ̃ h)) as L. Household h can then calculate that the expected total loss it will suffer from defecting at $t = 0$ is

$\infty L^{1}(1 + δ) - t$ , which equals $L/δ$ . If this future loss exceeds the present gain from defecting, then household h will not want to defect. In other words, h will not want to defect if

$B + (H - 1)A$

L

$> W(B) - W$

δ

$H_{905}$

or

$3B + (H - 1)AW(B) - Wδ < L$ / (1)

H

But if h does not find it in its interest to defect when the one-period gain from defection is the largest possible, it will certainly not want to defect in any other situation. We conclude that if inequality ( $1$ ) holds, then grim is an equilibrium strategy and equal sharing among households in every period is a resulting social equilibrium. Notice that, as we said, this will happen if δ is sufficiently small. We usually reserve the term “society” to denote a collective that has managed to find a mutually beneficial equilibrium.
Notice, however, that another social equilibrium of the repeated game is each household for itself. If every one believed that all others would break the agreement from the start, then every one would break the agreement from the start. Noncooperation would involve each household selecting the strategy: renege on the agreement. Failure to cooperate could be due simply to a collection of unfortunate, selfconfirming beliefs, and nothing else. It is also easy to show that noncooperation is the only social equilibrium of the repeated game if

$3B + (H - 1)AW(B) - Wδ > L$ / (2)

H

We now have in hand a tool for understanding how a community can slide from cooperative to noncooperative behavior. For example, political instability (in the extreme, civil war) can mean that households are increasingly concerned that they will be forced to disperse from their village. This translates into an increase in δ. Similarly, if households fear that their government is now bent on destroying communal institutions in order to strengthen its own authority, δ will increase. But from ( $1$ ) and ( $2$ ) we know that if δ increases sufficiently, then cooperation ceases.
The model therefore offers an explanation for why, in recent decades, cooperation at the local level has declined in the unsettled regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Social norms work only when people have reasons to value the future benefits of cooperation. In the above analysis, we allowed for the possibility that, in each period, household risks were positively correlated. More over, the number of households in any village is typically not large. These are two reasons why Desta’s household is unable to attain anything like full insurance against the risk they face.
Becky’s parents, in contrast, have access to an elaborate set of insurance markets that pool the risks of hundreds of thousands

906

of households across the country (even the world, if
the insurance company is a multinational). This helps
to reduce individual risk more than Desta’s parents can,     certain beliefs about the dollar’s future value in terms
because, first, spatially distant risks are more likely to    of goods and services. Those beliefs are in part based
be uncorrelated, and, second, Becky’s parents can pool
their risk with many more households. With enough
households and enough independence of their risk, the
law of large numbers [III.71 §4](/part-03/probability-distributions) practically guaran-
tees that equal sharing among those households will
provide each one with the average μ. This is an advan-
tage of markets, backed by the coercive power of the
state as an external enforcer: in a competitive market,
insurance contracts are available, enabling people who
do not know one another to do business through third
parties, in this case the insurance companies.
   Many of the risks that Desta’s parents face, such as
low rainfall, will in fact be very similar for all house-    put it formally, there are multiple social equilibria, each
holds in their village. Since the insurance they are able    supported by a set of self-fulfilling beliefs.
to obtain within their village is therefore very limited,
they adopt additional risk-reducing strategies, such as
diversifying their crops. Desta’s parents plant maize,
tef, and enset (an inferior crop), with the hope that even   nor do they know Becky. When Becky’s parents borrow
if maize were to fail one year, enset would not let them     from their bank, the funds made available to them come
down. That the local resource base in Desta’s village
is communally owned probably also has something to
do with a mutual desire to pool risks. Woodlands are
spatially nonhomogeneous ecosystems. In one year one
group of plants bears fruit, in another year some other
group does. If the woodland were divided into private
parcels, each household would face a greater risk than
it would under communal ownership. The reduction in
individual household risks owing to communal own-
ership may be small, but as average in comes are very
low, household benefits from communal ownership are
large. (For a fuller account of the management of local
commons in poor countries, see Dasgupta (1993).)

Payments in Becky’s world are made in money, ex-
press ed in U.S. dollars. Money would not be required
in a world where every one was known to be utterly
trustworthy, people did not incur computational costs,
and transactions were cost less: simple IOUs, stipulat-
ing repayment in terms of specific good and services,
would suffice in that world. However, we do not live
in that world. A debt in Becky’s world involves a con-
tract specifying that the borrower is to receive a certain   limited. There is a world of a difference between laws
number of dollars and that he promises to repay the

VII. The Influence of Mathematics
lender dollars in accordance with an agreed schedule.
When signing the contract the relevant parties entertain
on their confidence in the U.S. government to manage
the value of the dollar. Of course, the beliefs are based
on many other things as well; but the important point
remains that money’s value is maintained only because
people believe it will be maintained (the classic refer-
ence on this is Samuelson (1958)). Similarly, if, for what-
ever reason, people feared that the value would not be
maintained, then it would not be maintained. Currency
crashes, such as the one that occurred in Weimar Ger-
many in 1922–23, are an illustration of how a loss in
confidence can be self-fulfilling. Bank runs share that
feature, as do stock market bubbles and crashes. To
The use of money enables transactions to be anony-
mous. Becky frequently does not know the salespeople
in the department stores of her town’s shopping mall,
from unknown depositors. Literally millions of trans ac-
tions occur each day between people who have never
met and will never meet in the future. The problem
of creating trust is solved in Becky’s world by build-
ing confidence in the medium of exchange: money. The
value of money is maintained by the state, which has
an incentive to maintain it because, as we saw earlier, it
wishes not to destroy its reputation and be thrown out
of office.
In the absence of infrastructure, markets are unable
to penetrate Desta’s village. Becky’s suburban town, by
contrast, is embedded in a gigantic world economy.
Becky’s father is able to specialize as a lawyer only
because he is assured that his income can be used to

and heat from cooking ovens and radiators. Specializa-
and the Division of Labor
tion enables people to produce more in total than they
would be able to if they were each required to diversify
their activities. Adam Smith famously remarked that
the division of labor is limited by the size of the mar-
ket. Earlier we noted that Desta’s household does not
specialize, but produces pretty much all of its daily
requirements from a raw state. More over, the many
transactions it enters into with others, being supported
by social norms, are of necessity personalized, thus
and social norms as the basis of economic activities.

     9   Borrowing, Saving, and Reproducing
If you do not have insurance, then your consumption
will depend heavily on various contingencies. Purchas-
ing insurance helps to smooth out this dependence. We
shall see presently that the human desire to smooth
out the dependence on contingencies is related to the
equally common desire to smooth out consumption
across time: they are both a reflection of the strict con-    The right-hand side of the equation is the difference
cavity of the well-being function W . The flow of income
over a person’s lifetime tends not to be smooth, so
people look for mechanisms, such as mortgages and
pensions, that enable them to transfer consumption
across time. For instance, Becky’s parents took out a
mortgage on their house because at the time of pur-
chase they did not have sufficient funds to finance it.
The resulting debt decreased their future consumption,
but it enabled them to buy the house at the time they
did and there by raise current consumption. Becky’s
parents also pay into a pension fund, which transfers
present consumption to their retired future. Borrowing
for current consumption transfers future consumption
to the present; saving achieves the reverse. Since capi-     is once again a measure of the rate at which future
tal assets are productive, they can earn positive returns    well-being is discounted—owing to short sight edn ess,
if they are put to good use. This is one reason why, in
Becky’s world, borrowing involves having to pay inter-
est, while saving and investing earn positive returns.
   Becky’s parents also make a considerable investment
in their children’s education, but they do not expect to     nential. In Becky’s world the rate of return on invest-
be repaid for this. In Becky’s world, resources are trans-   ment is large; that is, investment is very productive. So
ferred from parents to children. Children are a direct
source of parental well-being; they are not regarded as
investment goods.
   A simple way to formulate the problem Becky’s par-
ents face when they arrange transfers of resources
across time is to imagine that they view themselves as
part of a dynasty. This means that, in reaching their
consumption and saving decisions, they take explicit
note not only of their own well-being and the well-being     of W means that you gain less from increasing con-
of Becky and Sam, but also of the well-being of their
potential grandchildren, great grandchildren, and so
on, down the generations.
   To analyze the problem, it is notationally tidiest to
assume that time is a continuous variable. At time t
(which we take to be greater than or equal to 0), let
K(t) denote household wealth and X(t) the consump-
tion rate, which is some aggregate based on the mar-
ket prices of what they consume. In practice, a house-
hold will want to smooth its consumption across both
time and contingencies, but in order to concentrate on

907
time we shall consider a deterministic model. Suppose
that the market rate of return on investment is a pos-
itive constant r . This means that if household wealth
at time t is K(t), then the income it earns from that
wealth at t is r K(t). The dynamical equation describing
the dynasty’s consumption options over time is then
d K(t)/dt = r K(t) − X(t).                        (3)
between the dynasty’s investment income at time t
(which is r times its wealth at t) and its consumption
at t. This amount is saved and invested, so it gives the
rate of increase of the dynasty’s wealth at t. The present
time is t = 0 and K(0) is the wealth that Becky’s parents
have inherited from the past. Earlier, we assumed that
the household allocates its consumption across contin-
gencies by maximizing its expected well-being. The cor-
responding quantity for allocating consumption across
time is
W (X(t))e−δt dt,
0
where, as before, we assume that W satisfies the con-
ditions W (X) > 0 and W (X) < 0. The parameter δ
the possibility of dynastic extinction, and so on. The
difference between this and the previous δ is that now
we are considering a continuous model rather than a
discrete one, but the decay is still assumed to be expo-
it makes empirical sense to suppose that r > δ. We
will see presently that this condition provides Becky’s
parents with the incentive to accumulate wealth and
pass it on to Becky and Sam, who in turn will accumu-
late their wealth and pass that on, and so on. For sim-
plicity, let us suppose that the “curvature” of W , which
is −XW (X)/W (X), is equal to a parameter α, whose
value exceeds 1.3 As we saw earlier, strict concavity
sumption than you lose from decreasing it by the same
amount. The strength of this effect is measured by α:
3. This means that W has the form B − AX −(α−1) , where A (which
is a positive number) and B (which can be of either sign) are the two
arbitrary constants that arise when we integrate the curvature of W
to arrive at W itself. We will see presently that the values that are
adopted for A and B have no bearing on the decisions that Becky’s
parents will want to make; that is, Becky’s parents’ optimum decision
is independent of A and B. Notice that, as α > 1, W (X) is bounded
above. The above form is particularly useful in applied work, because
in order to estimate W (X) from data on household consumption, one
has to estimate only one parameter, α. Empirical studies of saving
behavior in the United States have revealed that α is in the range 2–4.

the larger it is, the greater the benefit of any smoothing
you are able to do.
   Becky’s parents’ problem at t = 0 is to maximize the
quantity in (4) by making a suitable choice of the rate at
which they consume their wealth (namely, X(t)), sub-
ject to the condition (3), together with the conditions
that K(t) and X(t) should not be negative.4 This is a
problem in the calculus of variations [III.94](/part-03/variational-methods). But
it is of a some what unusual form, in that the horizon
is infinite and there is no boundary condition at infin-
ity. The reason for the latter is that Becky’s parents
would ideally like to determine the level of assets that
the dynasty ought to aim at in the long run; they do
not think it is appropriate to specify it in advance. If
we assume for the moment that a solution to the opti-
mization problem exists, then it turns out that it must
satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equation:

This equation is easily solved, and gives
However, for this problem we are free to choose X(0).
Koopmans showed in 1965 that X(t) in (6) is opti-
mal if W (X(t))K(t)e−δt → 0 as t → . nfty. It transpires
that, for the model in hand, there is a value of X(0),
which we shall write as X ∗ (0), such that the condi-
tion (3) and Koopmans’s asymptotic condition are sat-
isfied by the function X(t) given in (6). This implies
that X ∗ (0)e(r −δ)t/α is the unique optimum. Consump-
tion grows at the percentage rate (r − δ)/α and dynas-
tic wealth accumulates continually in order to make
that rising consumption level possible. All other things
being equal, the larger the productivity of investment r ,
the higher the optimum rate of growth of consumption.
By contrast, the larger the value of α, the lower the rate
of growth of consumption, since there is a greater wish
to spread it out among the generations.
   Let us conduct a simple exercise with our finding.
Suppose the annual market rate of return is 4% (i.e.,
r = 0.04 per year)—a reasonable figure for the United
States—that δ is small, and that α = 2. Then we can
conclude from (6) that optimum consumption will grow
at an annual rate of 2%; meaning that it will double
every thirty-five years—roughly, every generation. The

Ramsey insisted that δ = 0 and devised an ingenious argument to
show that an optimum function X(t) exists despite the fact that the
integral in (4) does not converge. For simplicity, I am assuming δ > 0.   lib rium!) is for girls to leave home on marriage and
As W (X) is bounded above and r > 0 (meaning that it is feasible for
X(t) to grow indefinitely), we should expect (4) to converge if X(t) is
allowed to rise fast enough.

figure is close to the postwar growth experience in the
United States.
For Desta’s parents the calculations are very differ-
ent, since they are heavily constrained in their ability
to transfer consumption across time. For example, they
have no access to capital markets from which they can
earn a positive return. Admittedly, they invest in their
land (clearing weeds, leaving portions fallow, and so
forth), but that is to prevent the productivity of the land
from declining. More over, the only way they are able
to draw on the maize crop following each harvest is to
store it. Let us see how Desta’s household would ideally
wish to consume that harvest over the annual cycle.
Let K(0) be the harvest, measured, say, in kilocalo-
ries. As rats and moisture are a potent combination,
stocks depreciate. If X(t) is the planned rate of con-
sumption and γ the rate of depreciation of the maize
α(d X(t)/dt) = (r − δ)X(t),
d K(t)/dt = −X(t) − γK(t).
(r −δ)t/α
X(t) = X(0)e                 .                (6)    Here, γ is assumed to be positive and both X(t)
and K(t) nonnegative. Let us imagine that Desta’s
parents regard their household’s well-being over the
1
year to be 0 W (X(t)) dt. As with Becky’s household,
let −XW (X)/W (X) be equal to a number α > 1.
Desta’s parents’ optimization exercise is to maximize
1
0 W (X(t)) dt, subject to (7) and the condition that
K(1) ⩾ 0.
This is a straightforward problem in the calculus of
variations. It can be shown that the optimum maize
consumption declines over time at the rate γ/α. This
explains why Desta’s family consume less and become
physically weaker as the next harvest grows nearer. But
Desta’s parents have realized that the human body is a
more productive bank. So the family consumes a good
deal of maize during the months following each har-
vest so as to accumulate body mass, but they draw on
that reserve during the weeks before the next harvest,
when maize reserves have been depleted. Across the
years maize consumption assumes a sawtooth pattern.
(Readers may wish to construct the model that incorpo-
rates the body as a store of energy: see Dasgupta (1993)
for details.)
As Desta and her siblings contribute to daily house-
hold production, they are economically valuable assets.
Her male siblings, however, offer a higher return to
their parents, because the custom (itself a social equi-
for boys to inherit the family property and offer secu-
rity to their parents in old age. Because of an absence

of capital markets and state pensions, male children are an essential form of investment. The transfer of resources in Desta’s household, in contrast to Becky’s, will be from the children to their parents. The under-five mortality rate in Ethiopia was, until relatively recently, in excess of $300$ per 1000 births. So, parents had to aim at large families if they were to have a reasonable chance of being looked after by a male child in their old age. But fertility is not entirely a private matter, since people are influenced by the choices of others.
This gives rise to a certain inertia in household behavior even under changing circumstances, which is why even though the under-five mortality rate has fallen in Ethiopia in recent decades, Desta has five siblings. 5 High population growth has placed additional pressure on the local ecosystem, meaning that the local commons that used to be managed in a sustainable manner no longer are. That they are not is reflected in Desta’s mother’s complaint that the daily time and effort required to collect from the local commons has increased in recent years.
$10$ Differences in Economic Life among Similar People In this article, I have used Becky’s and Desta’s experiences to show how it can be that the lives of essentially very similar people can become so different (for further elaboration, see Dasgupta ( 2004 )). Desta’s life is one of poverty.
In her world people do not enjoy food security, do not own many assets, are stunted and wasted, do not live long (life expectancy at birth in Ethiopia is under fifty years), cannot read or write, are not empowered, cannot insure themselves well against crop failure or household calamity, do not have control over their own lives, and live in unhealthy surroundings. The deprivations reinforce one another, so that the productivity of labor effort, ideas, physical capital, and of land and natural resources are all very low and remain low.
The rate of return on investment is zero, perhaps even negative (as it is with the storage of maize). Desta’s life is filled with problems each day. $5$ . See Dasgupta ( 1993 ) for the use of interdependent preferences to explain fertility behavior. In the notation of the section on social equilibria, we are to suppose that household h’s well-being has the form W h (X h , X  -  h), where one of the components of X h is the number of births in the household, and that the higher the fertility rate is among other households in the village, the larger the desired number of children in h.
The theory based on interdependent preferences interprets transitions from high to low fertility rates as bifurcations. Fertility rates are expected to decline even in Ethiopia. Interdependent preferences are currently being much studied by economists (see Durlauf and Young 2001).

$909$

Becky suffers from no such deprivation (for example, life expectancy at birth in the United States is nearly eighty years). She faces what her society calls challenges. In her world, the productivity of labor effort, ideas, physical capital, and of land and natural resources are all very high and continually increasing; success in meeting each challenge reinforces the prospects of success in meeting further challenges.
We have seen, however, that, despite the enormous differences between Becky’s and Desta’s lives, there is a unified way to view them, and that mathematics is an essential language for analyzing them. It is tempting to pronounce that life’s essentials cannot be reduced to mere mathematics; but in fact mathematics is essential to economic reasoning. It is essential because in economics we deal with quantifiable objects of vital interest to people. Acknowledgments. In describing Desta’s life, I have received much guidance from my colleague Pramila Krishnan.
