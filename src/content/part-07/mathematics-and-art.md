Introduction

This article focuses on the relationship between the history of mathematics and the history of art in twentieth century France, England, and the United States. The effect of mathematics on artists and the direct interactions between artists and mathematicians have both been extensively studied. These studies show that

VII. The Influence of Mathematics

knowledge of mathematics has had a significant influence on many artists, as well as on musicians and writers. In particular, the increasingly wide acceptance, during the nineteenth century, of mathematical ideas that had once been revolutionary contributed strongly to what is now called modern art. At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, artists expressed on canvas and in sculpture their understanding of the fourth dimension and of noneuclidean geometry [II . 2 § § 6 - 10 ] . In doing so, they left behind their earlier training and heritage, which had been heavily based on a mathematical perspective derived from euclid [VI.2](/part-06/euclid-ca). Their new ideas reflected the progress that had been made in mathematics, and many of the artists who formed new schools of thought were also engaged in interpreting these new mathematical developments. The connection between mathematics and art is rich, complex, and informative. This is evident in some of the artistic styles and the philosophies that developed under the influence of new mathematics (and science), and in the creation of mathematics to fulfill artistic needs. Some examples include the paintings (with their often-studied geometries) of Italian mathematician Piero della Francesca (ca . $1412 - 92$ ), who, having made a transcription of Jacopo of Cremona’s Latin translation of Archimedes’ Codex A, wrote out his own mathematical theories of perspective; Hans Holbein’s (1497-1543) Ambassadors (1533), which illustrates how an artist can use a distorted variation on mathematical perspective to fool the eye (anamorphosis); Artemesia Gentileschi’s (1593-1652) deliberate correction of a smattering of blood in her first version of Judith Beheading Holofernes (1612-13) to a parabolic arc of blood in the second version ( 1620 ) to match a sketch that her friend, scientist, court mathematician, and amateur painter Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) had made as a study for his as yet unpublished law of projectile motion; various works of the Dutch portrait painter Johannes Vermeer (1632-75) using the camera obscura; Johann Hummel’s (1769-1852) paintings of the making of the great granite bowl in Berlin, which used Gaspard Monge’s (1746-1818) Géométrie Descriptive (1799); sculpture by Naum Gabo ${}^{1} (1890 - 1977)$ and his brother Antoine Pevsner (1886-1962) following their youthful academic study of solid geometry; and the mathematically understandable but physically $1$ . Gabo was born Naum Neemia Pevsner but changed his name to distinguish himself from his painter brother.

to understand this in order to understand the rebel-

through the development of non-Euclidean geometry
and n-dimensional geometry. We then move on to the

In the early eighteenth century, the mathematician and amateur painter brook taylor [VI.16](/part-06/brook-taylor-16851731) published Linear Perspective: Or a New Method of Representing Justly All Manner of Objects as They Appear to the Eye in All Situations ( 1715 ), the first book on perspective to give a general treatment of vanishing points. As Taylor wrote on the title page, the book was “a work necessary for painters, architects, etc., to judge of, and regulate designs by.” Taylor invented the phrase “linear perspective” and stressed the importance of what is now described as the main theorem of perspective: given any direction not parallel to the plane of the picture there is a “vanishing point” through which the representations of all lines in that direction must pass. Since ancient times the axioms of Euclid’s Elements have provided the basis for the understanding of twoand three-dimensional figures, and in the fifteenth century they provided the foundations for the study of perspective. But during the nineteenth century the long-standing debate about whether to accept Euclid’s fifth axiom (the “parallel postulate ”) was resolved in a way that was to provoke a radical change in the perception of geometry: it was demonstrated by several mathematicians--notably lobachevskii [VI.31](/part-06/nicolai-ivanovich-lobachevskii-17921856) in 1829 , bolyai [VI.34] in 1832 , and riemann [VI.49] in 1854 -- that a consistent “non-Euclidean geometry” was possible in which the fifth axiom no longer held. The mathematician and expositor henri poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912) provided popular accounts of these new ideas in his books La Science et l’Hypothèse ( 1902 ) and Dernières Pensées ( 1913 ), which were widely read in France and elsewhere. Poincaré’s works provoked the highly influential French (and later American) artist Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) to attach new meanings to the concepts of space and measurement. Duchamp famously discussed and used Poincaré’s essays “Mathematical magnitude and experiment” and “Why space has three dimensions” to create artistic works of a completely new kind. (Duchamp ’ s ideas have been explored by the art historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson, who has used Duchamp’s extensive notes to analyze his understanding of four-dimensional and non-Euclidean geometries .)

Four-Dimensional Geometry

The modern movement known as cubism was greatly influenced by ideas of the fourth dimension. One of the ways cubists came into contact with these ideas, as well as with non-Euclidean geometry, was through their

reading of popular science fiction. In Gestes et Opinions du Docteur Faustroll ( 1911 ), French author Alfred Jarry ( $1873 - 1907$ ), a close friend of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) , attracted by the novelty of higher dimensional geometries, wrote about the work of the British mathematician arthur cayley [VI.46](/part-06/arthur-cayley-18211895). In 1843 , Cayley published “Chapters in the analytic geometry of n dimensions” in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal. This work, along with Hermann Grassmann’s (1809-77) Die Lineale A us dehn ung sl eh re, published in German a year earlier, was of interest not only to mathematicians but also to the general public, who recognized that in spaces of higher than three dimensions basic concepts had to be redefined and generalized. In 1880$\text{Washington Irving Stringham} (1847 - 1909)$, in another influential article, “Regular figures in n-dimensional space,” published in the American Journal of Mathematics, extended euler’s formula [I.4](/part-01/general-goals) for polyhedra to new objects called “polyhedroids” in which polyhedra are joined by their faces so as to enclose a hyperspace. This article, which included illustrations of four-dimensional figures created by Stringham, was cited for the next twenty years in the most important mathematical texts on four-dimensional geometry. Stringham’s figures intrigued several artists during the first decade of the twentieth century: Albert Gleizes’s (1881-1953) painting Woman with Phlox ( 1910 ) has flowers that are similar to Stringham’s “ikosatetrahedro id”; while in Henri Victor Gabriel Le Fauconnier’s (1881-1946) Abundance (1910-11) Stringham’s “hekatonikosihed roid” appears. Art forms evolved as artists found new ways of responding visually to the world around them. This was particularly true of cubism, in which the artist depicted objects from several viewpoints at once. In order to make sense of a cubist painting, the viewer was invited to construct a single (elusive) object from an array of different perspective “facets” laid out across the picture’s surface. The n-dimensional geometries influenced not just the visual arts but also literature, including works by Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells, and music, for example Edgard Varese’s “Hyperprism” ( 1923 ). Some mathematicians used this new mathematics for humorous purposes: two examples were Charles Dodgson in his Through the Looking Glass of 1872 and Edwin Abbott in Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions of 1884 . The latter in particular was read by French artists and was referred to in other mathematics books that they read, such as those by Esprit Pascal Jouffret (1837-1907).

Formal Protests against Euclid

In the early twentieth century, informed by Poincaré’s exposition of “the fourth dimension” and by knowledge of non-Euclidean geometry, a group of artists, including Gleizes and Jean Metzinger (1883-1956), explicitly attempted to liberate themselves from the geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space. In an essay titled “Du Cubisme” they stated, “If we wished to tie the painter’s space to a particular geometry, we should have to refer to the non-Euclidean scholars; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann’s theorems.” Here they appear to be referring to riemannian geometry [I.3](/part-01/fundamental-definitions), in which the notion of shape is less rigid than it is in Euclidean geometry. They go on to say, “An object does not have one absolute shape, it has several, it has as many as it has planes in a range of meaning.” It is likely that they are referring here to Poincaré’s “Les géométries non euclidiennes” in La Science et l’Hypothèse. The title of a (lost) 1913 painting of Metzinger’s, Nature morte ( $4$ me dimension), gives a good indication of his interest in representing three and four dimensions on a two-dimensional surface. Both Riemann’s geometry and the fourth dimension lay behind what these artists were trying to accomplish; they referred to both, however, as “non-Euclidean.” In 1918 , enraged by the destruction wrought by World War I, a dozen artists, including Jean (Hans) Arp (1886-1986) and Francis Picabia (1879-1953), signed the Dada Manifesto. In it, they explicitly stated their belief that “all objects, sentiments, obscurities, apparitions and the precise clash of parallel lines are weapons for the fight [against conformity].” By the $1930s$ , more and more artists were using their knowledge of mathematics to change, in a radical way, the appearance of sculpture and painting. $5$ Paris at the Center During the last decade of the nineteenth century and the years before the outbreak of World War I, artists were profoundly influenced not just by mathematics, but also by the extraordinary developments and discoveries in science and technology. For instance, motion pictures $(1880s)$ , radios $(1890s)$ , airplanes, cars, X-rays ( 1895 ), and the discovery of electrons ( 1897 ) all had an impact on the work of artists. The pioneering painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) wrote that an artist’s block he was experiencing disappeared when he learned of what was new in science; his old world collapsed and he could begin painting again. $947$ While it is not entirely clear how knowledge of scientific and mathematical thinking came to working artists in the early twentieth century, it is nevertheless evident that many artists were familiar with articles about mathematics written for the general public. There was also at least one tutor with whom they explored mathematics in depth. In 1911 , in Paris, the mathematician and actuary Maurice Princet (1875-1971) gave informal lectures on four-dimensional geometry, using mathematician Esprit Pascal Jouffret’s Traité Élémentaire de Géométrie à Quatre Dimensions et Introduction à la Géométrie à n Dimensions ( 1903 ). Jouffret’s Traité, which makes reference to Flatland, contains ways to present four dimensions on paper, the diagrams by Stringham of polyhedroids in four-dimensional space, and clear presentations of the ideas and theories of Poincaré. A second book, Mélanges de Géométrie à Quatre Dimensions ( 1906 ), emphasizes similar points. Princet’s audience was the Puteaux cubist group (which was sometimes called the “Section d ’ Or ”) . The central figures in this group were the three brothers Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), Duchamp, and Jacques Villon (born Gaston Emile Duchamp) ( $1875 - 1963$ ) . Princet’s involvement with the artists continued, even after his divorce from Alice Géry (1884-1975) , who shared a bohemian life with the best man at their wedding, Pablo Picasso, and who later married André Derain (1880-1954). Géry had introduced Princet to the artists. An avid reader, she may have been the sitter for Seated Woman with a Book ( 1910 ), an early cubist painting by Picasso. Together, in Paris, Princet and Duchamp privately studied Poincaré and Riemann, who were two important sources for Duchamp’s work, as we have already seen. Duchamp’s own notes, written a decade later as he created his famous painting The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) ( $1915 - 23$ ), document his increasing interest in and understanding of four-dimensional and non-Euclidean geometries. Referring to Jouffret’s book, which explained how a three-dimensional projection of a four-dimensional figure can be considered as a sort of “shadow,” Duchamp told friends that the bride in his picture was a three dimensional projection of a four-dimensional object recorded in two-dimensional form. He also refers to the fact, which fascinated him, that electrons were known to exist but could not be directly observed, claiming that his picture contained elements that were not directly represented. These notes, and others containing speculations on mathematics, were published

$948$

in À l’Infinitif ( 1966 ). Working in a field hitherto dominated by fifteenth-century Renaissance perspective and its dependence on a Euclidean framework, Duchamp and other artists learned with excitement that many mathematicians no longer felt it necessary to subject themselves to Euclidean restrictions, and art was dramatically changed. Rather surprisingly, Riemann and Poincaré were even part of the original inspiration for Duchamp’s famous “readymades,” found objects presented as art. As the artist Rhonda Shearer described in the New York Academy of Science newsletter in 1997 , Duchamp was very taken with Poincaré’s description of the creative process in Science and Method. Poincaré reported on his accidental discovery of the so-called Fuchsian functions. After days of “unfruitful” conscious work spent trying to prove that the functions do not exist, he changed his habit and one evening drank black coffee late at night. The next morning, “fruitful” ideas came into his conscious mind. From these he selected “tout fait ” (readymade) ideas and saw, surprisingly, a way to prove the existence of the mathematical functions whose existence he had previously doubted. Duchamp used the term “readymade” (and “tout fait ”) in 1915 . The examples he selected, titled, and signed are ordinary manufactured objects such as a urinal turned upside down, Fountain ( 1917 ), and a bottle drying rack, Bottle Rack ( 1914 ), thought to be the first readymade.

Constructivism

In Russia in 1920 , the artists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner wrote that they had turned to mathematics in order to rethink their work. As they put it: “We construct our work as the universe constructs its men; as the engineer constructs his bridges; as the mathematician his formulas of the orbits.” Gabo began to use a stereometric system that he had studied in engineering, creating sculptures such as “Head No. $2$ ” (see figure $2$ ). The subject of stereometry goes back at least as far as 1579 , where it is listed in the “Groundplat” of John Dee’s celebrated Mathematicall Praeface to Billingsley’s edition of Euclid. It concerns the measurement of properties of solids, and was widely taught at universities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: indeed, it is still taught today in some European countries. Gabo and Pevsner constructed their sculptures out of planar parts, so space, rather than mass, became the sculptural element. Density was no longer important, with the result that the subtraction techniques used in classical sculpture (where material is carved away from

Sculpture became airy; surfaces became less significant and have remained so, at least within the tradition that became known as constructivism. This tradition was first formalized in the Russian Realistic Manifesto ( 1920 ), written and signed by Gabo and Pevsner. There they argued that “The material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole ... a product of an industrial order like a car.” Gabo took constructivism to the Bauhaus in Germany and then to France and England in the $1930s$ , where he worked alongside the British artists Barbara Hepworth ( $1903 - 75)$ and her husband Ben Nicholson (1894-1982). Gabo and Nicholson (with Leslie Martin) edited Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art ( 1937 ), which contained articles by themselves as well as ones by Hepworth, Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) , and the critic Herbert Read (1893-1968), among others. In Circle, Gabo, referring back to the seventeen-year-old Realistic Manifesto, spells out what is meant by constructivism by guiding the reader to see how two cubes (shown in the photograph in figure $3$ ) can illustrate the distinction between two kinds of representation of the same object: carving and construction. The cubes have different methods of execution and different centers of interest: one is mass and the other makes visible the space in which mass exists. Constructivism created an artistic context in which a mathematically understood space became a sculptural element. As Gabo wrote:

“The stereometrical method in which [the right-hand
cube] is executed shows elementarily the constructive
principle of a sculptural space expression.”
   These artists studied mathematical models in muse-
ums and catalogues. These models, designed by math-
ematicians for teaching about surfaces, were made of
string, cardboard, metal, and plaster. The same artists
also studied photographs produced by the surrealist           Figure 4 Man Ray’s Allure de la Fonction Elliptique, 1936.

on a model that had been found by another surrealist
artist, Max Ernst, at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris.
Ray portrayed these models with impressionistic pat-
terns of light and shadow (see figure 4); he was inter-
ested in the “elegance”—the aesthetic persuasiveness—
of the model, though aware that the original model-
maker had sought to give visual form to an elegance
inherent in the mathematical equations themselves.
Other artists too, such as Hepworth and Gabo, stated
that it was not mathematics itself but the beauty of
the mathematical models that provided the inspiration
for their work. Hepworth studied mathematical mod-
els that were on display in Oxford, considering them
to be “sculptural working out of mathematical equa-
tions.” They inspired her to add strings to her own
work. However, she wrote that her inspiration was not
the mathematics exhibited by the strings, but rather

   A close friend of both Gabo and Hepworth was the
renowned sculptor Henry Moore (1898–1986). Moore
too spoke and wrote about the influence of mathemati-          ures at the ends with colored threads from one to the

inaugurated an exhibition of his work at the Stedelijk Museum. After Penrose viewed Escher’$s_{1953}$ print Relativity at this exhibition, he and his father, geneticist Lionel Penrose (1898-1972), were inspired to create impossible figures: the Penrose tribar and the Penrose staircase published in the British Journal of Psychology in 1958 -- the Penroses sent Escher an offprint of the article. Escher subsequently used these in two wellknown lithographs: Waterfall ( 1961 ), in which water runs in perpetual motion from the base of a waterfall to the top of the waterfall; and Ascending and Descending ( 1960 ), which features a building with an impossible staircase which constantly rises or falls (depending on the direction you go around it) but returns to the same level. Coxeter’s field was symmetry in the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes, but he also took pleasure in analyzing the works of artists from a mathematical point of view. Escher began a correspondence with him shortly after the congress, at which they met, and it lasted until his death in 1972 . In 1957 Coxeter requested the use of two of Escher’s drawings to illustrate planar symmetry in “Crystal Symmetry and Its Generalizations,” his presidential address to the Royal Society of Canada--in this way Escher’s work spread among the mathematical community. In 1958 , Coxeter sent Escher a letter containing a reprint of his address. The response was a request: “Could [you] give me a simple explanation how to construct the following circles, whose centers approach gradually from the outside till they reach the limit?” Coxeter’s reply, meant to be helpful, gave Escher one small piece of useful information; the rest of the lengthy letter was unintelligible to the artist. But from the pictures and his own keen geometric intuition, Escher was able to construct the circles he required, and by 1958 he was the first graphic artist to have used the three main geometries in his works: Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic. Coxeter was astounded that an artist, untrained in mathematics, could produce such accurate “equidistant curves” as he did in his 1958 woodcut Circle Limit III. Escher always claimed that he knew little mathematics, but many of his prints are a direct result of using mathematics. Mathematician Doris Schattschneider has said that Escher was really a “secret mathematician,” since much of his work depended on his pursuit of mathematical questions that arose from his interests and his interaction with mathematicians, which he referred to as “Coxetering.” He did, however, write that he preferred to find solutions and understanding by himself.

As well as his artistic and mathematical legacy, Escher had an important influence on crystallographe rs, who have used his symmetry drawings for analysis. Crystal lo graph er Caroline Mac Gillavry has pointed out that Escher began a deep study of color symmetry and created a classification system in $1941 - 42$ , which was some time before crystallographe rs became interested in this field of study, which has become very active. The International Union of Crystallography subsequently commissioned Escher to illustrate Mac Gillavry’s Symmetry Aspects of M. C. Escher’s Periodic Drawings, first published in 1965 . Its purpose was to interest “students in the laws which underlie repeating designs and their colorings.”

Spain and Dalí

As we have seen, some artists were influenced by their own knowledge of mathematics, others by a less direct appreciation of mathematical thinking, and still others by the appeal of mathematical models. Another kind of connection is illustrated by the example of the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí (1904-89) and his relationship with the mathematician and graphic artist Thomas Banchoff ( 1938$-)$. Banchoff is a professor of mathematics at Brown University, known for his research in differential geometry in three and four dimensions. Since the late $1960s$ , he has also been involved in the development of computer graphics. Dalí’$s_{1954}$ painting of Christ crucified on a hypercube was reproduced in $a_{1975}$ article about Banchoff’s pioneering work, which used computer animation to illustrate geometry beyond the third dimension. This led to a series of meetings between Banchoff and Dalí over the next decade, at which hypercubes and other aspects of geometry and art were discussed. One joint project was the design for a giant sculpture of a horse that would appear realistic from only one viewing position. Dalí eventually envisioned a horse with its head in front of the viewer and its rump somewhere on the moon--clearly a project solely of the imagination. Dalí created works using anamorphoses, as other artists, beginning with Leonardo, had done. He prized his interactions with scientists and mathematicians, later stating, “Scientists give me everything, even the immortality of the soul.” Dalí also met the French mathematician René Thom (1923-2002) to discuss catastrophe theory, which, in 1983 , he sought to represent in what turned out to be his last series of paintings.

7.4   Other Recent Developments: The United States
      and Helaman Ferguson

So far we have seen how mathematics has influenced
art. Occasionally, artists have actually created math-
ematics, for instance to produce sculpture by means
of carefully chosen mathematical equations. The noted
American sculptor/mathematician Helaman Ferguson
(1943–) divides his time equally between mathemat-
ics and the interpretation of mathematics in his art.
As a mathematician he designs algorithms for operat-
ing machinery and for scientific visualization. In 1979
he found a method for finding integer relationships
between more than two real or complex numbers—this
was later named one of the top ten algorithms of the
twentieth century. As an artist, he carves in stone. In
1994, he asked mathematician Alfred Gray (1939–98) to
develop equations for a Costa surface (named after the
graduate student who invented equations for describ-
ing a minimal surface with holes), so that he could           Figure 8 Ferguson’s Invisible Handshake II : a triply punc-
sculpt the surface (see figure 8). Gray developed the          tured torus with negative Gaussian curvature. Image cour-
equations in terms of the Weierstrass zeta function.          tesy of the artist.
This could be used with Mathematica, which made it
possible for Ferguson to create a stone sculpture. Fer-
guson sees his art as deriving from applied mathemat-
ics that has been developed over the course of the last
two centuries:

  images of the surface (Hoffman–Hoffman), recognize
  symmetry and prove the surface has not self intersec-
  tions (Hoffman–Meeks), discover fast parametric equa-
  tions for the surface (Gray), and finally return to nature
