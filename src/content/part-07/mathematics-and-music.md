Figure $1$ Successive intervals in a major scale tuned in just intonation. reflect the ratios of the natural over tone series. 3 The Pythagorean major third, which has the relatively complex ratio of (. rac{3}{2})4/22 , o$r^{81}{}^{64}$ , was replaced by the slightly smaller major third of just intonation, which has the much simpler ratio $5$ : $4$ . The difference between these two intervals is known as the syntonic comma, which corresponds to the ratio $81$ : $80$ , or $1$ . 0125 . Likewise, the Pythagorean minor third has ratio $32$ :
$27$ , and so is slightly smaller than the minor third of just intonation, which has ratio $6$ : $5$ . The difference is again a syntonic comma. The Pythagorean major and minor sixths, the octave inversions of the thirds, also differ from their just counterparts by a syntonic comma. Suppose that you want to build a C-major scale in just intonation. You can do it as follows. Start with C and define each other note by the ratio of its frequency to that of C. The subdominant and dominant, that is, $F$ and  G, have ratios $4$ : $3$ and $3$ : $2$ , respectively.
From these three notes one can build major triads in the ratios $4$ : $5$ : $6$ . So E, for instance, which belongs to the major triad that starts with C, has ratio $5$ : $4$ . Similarly, A has ratio $5$ : $3$ , since it is in $a$ ratio $5$ : $4$ with  F. With this kind of calculation, one ends up with the scale shown in figure $1$ , where the fractions now represent the frequency ratios between successive notes. The smaller whole tone ( $10$ : $9$ ) between notes D and E creates intonation problems for the supertonic triad, D-F-A.
While the minor triads on E and A (the mediant and submediant) produce the proportion $10$ : $12$ : $15$ , the minor triad on D is out of tune. Its fifth, D-A, is a syntonic comma flat, as is its third, D-F, which is in fact a Pythagorean minor third. Tempering (increasing or decreasing) the size of intervals offered a practical solution to the problems inherent in just intonation by distributing the syntonic comma among the major thirds or the perfect fifths of the scale, there by compromising the purity of one interval to preserve the purity of another. This prac$3$ .
The partials of the over tone series are multiples of the frequency of the fundamental pitch, and the first six partials generate the intervals of the major triad. For instance, the first six partials of the over tone series of a fundamental pitch $C$ are $C(1$ : 1), $C(2$ : 1), $G(3$ : 1), $C(4$ : 1), $E (5$ : 1), $G (6$ : 1).

tice became known as meant one temperament. Various systems of meant one temperament were put forward in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for the tuning of keyboard instruments, the most common of which was quarter-comma meant one temperament. In this system the perfect fifth is lowered by a quarter of a syntonic comma so that the major thirds have the pure ratio $5$ : $4$ . A perpetual problem with meant one temperaments is that, while modulation to closely related keys sounds pleasing, modulation to more remote keys sounds out of tune.
The system of equal temperament, in which the syntonic comma is distributed evenly among all twelve semitones of the octave, gradually became adopted because it removed the limitations on keys for modulation. The discrepancies between just and equaltempered intervals are small and easily accepted by most listeners. The ratio of an equal-tempered semi√

or $128$ , which is $1$ . 498307 . . . , where as a just perfect fifth, with ratio $3$ : $2$ , is of course $1$ . $5$ . In equal temperament, one starts from a reference such as the note A, which is usually taken to have frequency $440 Hz.^{4}$ All √ other notes have frequencies of the form 440( 2)n ,

where n is the number of semitones between the note in question and the reference note A. In equal temperament, enharmonic notes such as $C*$ and $D +$ are acoustically identical--that is, they share the same frequency. Equal temperament was well-suited for the kind of music that was written from the eighteenth century onward, with its much greater range of modulations and chromatic harmonic vocabulary. The unit of the cent was defined by A. J.
Ellis as the ratio between two pitches separated by one hundredth of an equal-tempered semitone, and became the most commonly used unit for measuring and comparing intervals. 5 The octave consists, therefore, of 1200 cents. If $a$ and $b$ are two frequencies, then the distance in cents between the corresponding pitches is given by the formula $n = 1200$ log ${}^{2}(a/b)$ . (As a check, notice that if $a = 2b$ then one does indeed get the answer $n = 1200$ .) $4$ . The frequency of a pitch is a measurement of the number of cycles per second (abbreviated as “ cps ”).
More commonly, the number of cycles per second is identified in units called hertz (abbreviated as “ Hz ”), named after the physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. $5$ . Ellis’s account of the cent appeared in his appendix to the eminent nineteenth-century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz’s On the Sensations of Tone (1870 ; English edn., 1875) .

   Microtonal systems based on the equal division of
the octave into more than twelve parts were proposed
and realized by some composers in the twentieth cen-
tury, but they have not become widely used in Western
music. However, the idea of dividing the octave into
equal parts has become fundamental. It means that                Figure 2 J. S. Bach, Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 2,

one regards two notes an octave apart as “the same,”
which makes good musical sense, then one is dividing
all notes into twelve equivalence classes [I.2 §2.3](/part-01/language-and-grammar).
The natural model for these is arithmetic modulo 12.
As we shall see later, the symmetries of the group of
integers mod 12 are of great musical significance.
