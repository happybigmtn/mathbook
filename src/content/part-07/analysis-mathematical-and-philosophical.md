Philosophical problems are never solved for the same
reason that treasonous conspiracies never succeed: as
successful conspiracies are never called “treason,” so
solved problems are no longer called “philosophy.”
Philosophy, which once included almost every subject
in the university (every subject in which the highest
degree is Ph. D.), has thus been shrunk by success.
The greatest shrinkage occurred during the seven-
teenth and eighteenth centuries, when natural philoso-
phy became natural science. Philosophers of the period,
all intensely interested in the emergence of the new sci-
ence, differed over issues of scientific method. Philos-
ophy had always been understood to differ from, for
instance, theology, by restricting itself to the methods
of reasoned argument and the evidence of experience,
with out appeal to authority, tradition, revelation, or
faith. But philosophers of the era of the scientific revo-
lution disagreed about the comparative importance of
reason and experience.
  In introductory histories, philosophers are accord-
ingly divided into the rationalists, or the party of rea-
son, and the empiricists, or the party of experience. The
former, mainly from Continental Europe, were domi-
nant in the seventeenth century, while the latter, mainly
from the British Isles, predominated in the eighteenth.
The rationalists, who included the mathematicians des-
cartes [VI.11](/part-06/ren-descartes-15961650) and leibniz [VI.15](/part-06/gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-16461716), were impressed by
the apparent ability of pure thought—logical deduction
from self-evident postulates—to achieve, as it seemed
to do in geometry, substantive results with worldly
applications; and they were tempted to adopt simi-
lar methods in other areas. Spinoza even wrote his

VII. The Influence of Mathematics
his to ric peak of the influence of mathematics on phi-
losophy. The empiricists, who included that acute critic
one cannot proceed as the rationalists wished to. The
principles of physics are not self-evident, but must be
conjectured from and tested against systematic obser-
vation and controlled experiment. What puzzled lead-
ing empiricists such as Locke and Hume was how pure
thought was able to succeed in any area, as it seemed
to in geometry. Thus, while for rationalists mathemat-
ics was a source of methods, for empiricists it was the
source of a problem.
Philosophical
An influential formulation of that problem was of-
John P. Burgess
fered by Kant, whose system attempted a synthesis of
rationalism with empiricism. On the one hand, Kant

than a posteriori, by which he meant that they are
knowable in advance of experience rather than depen-
denton it. On the other hand, they are synthetic rather
than analytic, which is to say that they are more than
mere logical consequences of the definitions of con-
cepts, statements whose denials would amount to con-
tradictions in terms. Philosophy of mathematics, today
a smallish specialty within philosophy of science, itself
a smallish specialty within epistemology or the theory
of knowledge, played a much more important role for
Kant, who in his own summary of his system gave pride
of place to the question, “How is pure mathematics pos-
sible?” as the first case of the question, “How is syn-
thetic a priori knowledge possible?” Kant’s proposed
solution was based on the insight that our knowledge
must be shaped as much by the nature of ourselves,
the knowers, as by that of what is known. Kant con-
cluded that space, the subject matter of geometry, and
time, according to him the ultimate subject matter of
arithmetic, were not features of things as they are in
themselves, but rather of things as we must perceive
and experience them, given the nature of our sensi-
bility. Synthetic a priori knowledge is ultimately self -
knowledge, knowledge of the forms that we supply,
and into which reality independent of us pours con-
tent. This distinction between phenomena, or things
as we experience them, and noumena, things beyond
our experience, about which we can wonder but never
know, was central to Kant’s entire system, his ethics as
much as his metaphysics.
Such is the history, painted in quick strokes and
with a broad brush, of early modern philosophy. Af-
ter Kant, the story no longer has as clear a plotline.

VII.12.   Analysis, Mathematical and Philosophical

System building continued for another generation,
down to Hegel. But eventually, and inevitably, his
system collapsed under its own weight, and in the
ensuing reaction philosophers went off in all direc-
tions. Out side academia, striking figures sporadically
appeared on the borders of philosophy and literature,
notably Nietzsche. Meanwhile, academic philosophy,
rather like Victorian architecture, experienced a num-     tal Europe (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolf Carnap, and
ber of revivals, of which the Kantian was the most
prominent. But even as neo-Kantianism prevailed in
the schools, the Kantian conception of mathematics
was under attack. First, though the development of
consistent non-Euclidean geometries in itself only con-    the “self-affirmation”) of the German university. This
firms Kant’s claim that geometry is synthetic, those
who developed alternatives to Euclid were quickly led
to question whether Euclidean geometry is really a pri-    style, or loathsome politics—created a split that no one
ori, as Kant had claimed. gauss [VI.26](/part-06/carl-friedrich-gauss-17771855) had already
concluded that geometry is a posteriori, or, as he put
it, of the same status as mechanics, and riemann
[VI.49] argued at greater length that an examination
of the hypotheses that lie at the foundation of geom-
etry must lead us into the domain of the neighboring
science of physics. Second, while few doubted Kant’s
claim that arithmetic is a priori, a challenge arose to    the two twentieth-century traditions came to see differ-
the claim that it is synthetic in the work of gottlob
frege [VI.56](/part-06/gottlob-frege-18481925) and (slightly later, but largely indepen-    selves, thus extending the division between them right
dently) bertrand russell [VI.71](/part-06/bertrand-arthur-william-russell-18721970), who both attempted
a derivation of arithmetic from logic along with an
appropriate definition of number.
   Frege’s work long remained less well-known than it
deserved to be, despite the publicity given it by Rus-     that nowadays for a student trained in one to take up
sell once he became aware of it himself. As a result,
Frege, though very influential at present, is more a pre-
cursor of the tradition in philosophy within which he
stands than a founder, the founders being rather Rus-
sell and his contemporary and colleague G. E. Moore.
That pair began by rebelling against the philosophy
of their teachers, a late nineteenth-century aberration    on either side of the analytic/Continental divide that
called absolute idealism, a kind of Hegel revival; but     all philosophers on that side uphold. In particular,
it soon became apparent that the rebels were aiming
at more than just a return to the traditional empiri-
cism of British philosophy from Bacon to Mill. Mean-
while, Edmund Husserl was developing the first form
of what was to become the great rival to the Russell–
Moore tradition in twentieth-century philosophy. Like
Frege, Husserl had begun his career with work in the
philosophy of arithmetic, work of which Frege himself
had taken notice, and no one in the early twentieth cen-   varieties half a century or so ago; but each was even
tury expected that Husserl’s and Frege’s heirs would,

929
within a generation, split into two non communicating
lines of descent.
The two lines of development or traditions are oddly
named, with a stylistic label, “analytic,” for one, and
a geographical label, “Continental,” for the other. This
odd labeling reflects the historical fact that the prin-
cipal representatives of the analytic style in Contin en-
others) were forced to go into exile in the English-
speaking world in the 1930 s, as a result of the process
generally known as the Nazification (but celebrated
by Husserl’s estranged student Martin Heidegger as
physical separation—more than Heidegger’s break with
his teacher, hostility toward science, rebarbative prose
could have anticipated twenty years earlier.
With the years the gap has widened, as later writ-
ers on each side tend to read and cite only prede-
cessors on that side. Indeed, the divide has extended
backwards in time. For while Borges has said that in
literature great writers create their own predecessors,
in philosophy even not-so-great writers can do so, and
ent nineteenth-century figures as leading up to them-
back to the death of Kant (with Hegel rather than Hei-
degger being identified as the first distinctively Conti-
nental philosopher). The gap between the reading lists
of students in the two traditions has become so large
the other is virtually to switch disciplines.
The word “tradition,” rather than “school” or “move-
ment,” is used advisedly, for each tradition has con-
tained several movements, as well as individuals who
defy classification by school. It would be a serious mis-
take to suppose that there is any doctrine or method
analytic philosophy should not be confused with log-
ical positivism, a Viennese–American school defunct
for more than half a century, nor should Continental
philosophy be confused with existentialism, a literary-
philosophical movement out of fashion in Paris for
nearly as long. Logical positivism and existentialism
were indeed varieties of analytic and Continental phi-
losophy respectively, and perhaps the most prominent
then far from being the only variety. In assessing the

930

influence of mathematics on philosophy in the twen-
tieth century, one must take into account divisions
within each tradition as much as the division between
the two traditions.
   It may be true that since the early work of Husserl
there has been comparatively little contact between
mathematics and philosophy on the Continental side,
though the label “structuralist” is broad enough to take    influenced by mathematical logic: rather, they created
in both the mathematics of bourbaki [VI.96](/part-06/nicolas-bourbaki-1935) and the
various anthropological and linguistic doctrines that
became influential in France after the eclipse of exis-
tentialism; but it is also true that the direct influence
of mathematical ways of thinking on many individu-
als and groups within the analytic tradition has been
negligible. Thus, just as there are distinguishable Ger-    Let us turn, then, to consider the state of mathemat-
man and French subtraditions within the Contin en-
tal tradition, so within the analytic tradition one may     ning our account with a quick look back at the situation
distinguish a more technically oriented subtradition,
including Frege (who was himself a professor of math-
ematics), Russell (who as an undergraduate had con-
centrated on mathematics before turning to philoso-
phy), and the logical positivists (who had mostly been
trained as theoretical physicists), from a nontechnical     of dimensions one, two, and three. All that changed
or antitechnical subtradition, including Moore, Witt gen-    quickly when the work of Gauss, hamilton [VI.37](/part-06/william-rowan-hamilton-18051865), and
stein, the so-called ordinary-language school of mid-
century Oxford, and others. (Wittgenstein even went so
far as to claim that mathematicians always make bad
philosophers, a sweeping judgment condemning many
right back to Thales and pythagoras [VI.1](/part-06/pythagoras-ca), though
the immediate target was Russell.) However, there has
been very much more communication and influence
back and forth between the two subtraditions within
each tradition than between the two traditions.
   Even among the more technical analytic philosophers
the influence of mathematics after the period of the
founders has been occasional and sporadic, and has
come mostly from areas such as mathematical logic,
computability theory, probability and statistics, game
theory, and mathematical economics (as in the work
of the philosopher–economist Amartya Sen), which are
rather far from the core of pure mathematics as math-
ematicians see it. Thus it is hard to imagine the solu-     sis took place in two directions. The eighteenth-century
tion to any of the Millennium Prize Problems (except
perhaps the P vs NP problem, the one question com-
ing from theoretical computer science rather than core
mathematics) having measurable impact even among
the most susceptible analytic philosophers. In contrast     f (x) = sin x + cos x or f (x, y) = x 2 + y 2 . On the one

of the early figures Frege and Russell, has been over-

whelming even among the less technically oriented ana-
lytic philosophers. The branches of mathematics that
influenced Frege and Russell were geometry and alge-
bra and, above all, the third great branch of core mathe-
matics, “analysis,” in the mathematical rather than the
philosophical sense, the branch beginning with differ-
ential and integral calculus. (Frege and Russell were not
it, and mathematical analysis was a key influence on its
creation.)
2    Mathematical Analysis
and Frege’s New Logic
ical analysis in the days of Frege and Russell, begin-
ca. 1800. As rich as its results were, and as powerful
its applications, mathematics at the beginning of the
nineteenth century was concerned with but a few struc-
tures: the natural, rational, real, and complex num-
ber systems; and the Euclidean and projective spaces
others introduced the first non-Euclidean spaces and
first noncommutative algebras, after which a pro li fer-
ation of new mathematical structures rapidly ensued.
This generalizing tendency went hand in hand with a
rigorizing tendency, since the proliferation of novelties
persuaded mathematicians that they needed to adhere
more strictly than had become customary to the ancient
ideal of rigor, according to which all new results in
mathematics are to be logically deduced from previous
results, and ultimately from a list of explicit axioms.
For with out rigor, intuitions derived from familiarity
with more traditional structures might easily be uncon-
sciously transferred to new situations where they are
no longer appropriate.
Generalization and rigorization went hand in hand
not only in geometry and algebra, but also in mathe-
mat ical analysis. Generalization in mathematical analy-
notion of “function” had been that of an operation
applying to one or more real numbers as inputs or
“arguments” and yielding a real number as output
or “value,” according to a certain formula, such as
by dropping the requirement of an explicit formula. On
the other hand, Cauchy, Riemann, and others extended

VII.12.   Analysis, Mathematical and Philosophical

the notion to allow as arguments not only real num-
bers but also complex numbers, that is, numbers of the
form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is
the “imaginary” square root of −1.
   Rigorization in mathematical analysis also took place
on two levels. First, for each theorem it had to be clearly   Frege’s broad new logic, or still broader extensions of
stated just what special properties were being assumed
for the functions to which the result was supposed
to apply, since special properties such as definability
by a formula (or continuity or different i ability) were
no longer being built into the highly general notion
of function itself; more over, the relevant properties
themselves had to be clearly defined (leading to the
so-called weierstrass [VI.44](/part-06/karl-weierstrass-18151897) epsilon–delta definitions
of such concepts as “continuity” and “differentiabil-
ity” in freshman calculus), since, as poincaré [VI.61](/part-06/jules-henri-poincar-18541912)
remarked, until one has rigor in one’s definitions one
cannot have rigor in one’s theorems. Second, the prop-
erties assumed for the numbers to which the functions
apply had also to be clarified and stated explicitly as
axioms, with the properties of complex numbers being
derived by logical definition and deduction from prop-
erties of real numbers (by Hamilton), which themselves
in turn were derived from properties of rational num-
bers (by dedekind [VI.50](/part-06/julius-wilhelm-richard-dedekind-18311916) and cantor [VI.54](/part-06/georg-cantor-18451918)), which
themselves in turn were derived from properties of the
system of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, and so on.
   Here Frege wished to press still further, and to do
what Kant had said could not be done, and derive the
properties of the natural numbers themselves from
pure logic. For this purpose he needed to become
more self-conscious about logic than even the most rig-
orist mathematicians: he needed not merely to adhere
implicitly to the rules and standards of logical def-
inition and deduction, but also to analyze explicitly
those very rules and standards themselves. Such self-
conscious analysis of definition and deduction was a
topic that had, since antiquity, traditionally belonged
to philosophy rather than mathematics. Frege needed
to carry out a revolution in this philosophical sub-
ject, one that would bring it much closer to mathe-
matics, and would bring progress to a field that Kant
had described as having advanced not a step beyond
the state in which it was left by its founder, Aristotle.     Aristotle’s. Though it is a pretty poor achievement if
(The description is slightly exaggerated, but essentially     it is considered as the best the human race could do
correct, in that each step forward in the two millen-
nia after Aristotle had been followed by a step back.)
It was Frege’s new logic, detached from its original role     vidual in the course of a career devoted to many other
as part of a special project in foundations of arithmetic     projects. For Aristotle created from nothing the science
and applied to quite diverse subject matters, that was

931
to become the single most important general instru-
ment for philosophical analysis in the twentieth cen-
tury. Indeed, to a large degree philosophical analysis
simply is the logical analysis of philosophical rather
than mathematical notions, carried out with the aid of
it introduced by his successors. It was by the creation
of this general instrument of a new logic, rather than
the specialized application he made of it to the phi-
losophy of mathematics, that Frege became the grand-
father of analytic philosophy. And the novelty in Frege’s
logic was directly inspired by novel developments in
mathematical analysis, as he himself emphasized.
In an article entitled “Function and concept,” Frege
describes the broadening of the notion of function as
follows (in the translation by Peter Geach and Max
Black):
Now how has the reference of the word “function” been
extended by the progress of science? We can distin-
guish two directions in which this has happened. In the
first place, the field of mathematical operations that
serve for constructing functions has been extended.
Be sides addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and
their converses, the various means of transition to the
limit have been introduced—to be sure, with out peo-
ple’s being always clearly aware that they were thus
adopting something essentially new. People have even
gone further still, and have actually been obliged to
resort to ordinary language, because the symbolic lan-
guage of Analysis failed, e.g., when they were speaking
of a function whose value is 1 for rational and 0 for irra-
tional arguments. [This is a famous example of dirich-
let [VI.36].] Secondly, the field of possible arguments
and values for functions has been extended by the
admission of complex numbers. In conjunction with
this, the sense of the expressions “sum,” “product,” etc.
had to be defined more widely.
Frege adds at the end, “In both directions I go still
further.” For it was the broadening of the notion of
function by mathematicians that provided Frege with
the clue he needed to develop a logic broader than
Aristotle’s.
Before one can appreciate the advance represented
by Frege’s logic, one must understand something of
in this area in a couple of thousand years, it is a bril-
liant one when considered as the work of a single indi-
of logic, whose aim is to distinguish valid from in valid

932

inferences of conclusions from premises. Here an infer-
ence is valid if its form alone, regard less of the material    tory logic text, you will find instructions on how to
truth or falsehood of premises and conclusions, guar-
antees that if the premises are true, then the conclu-
sion is true. Equivalently, the inference is valid if in all   textbook-style as follows:
inferences of the same form in which the premises are
true, the conclusion is true. Thus, to adapt an exam-
ple of Lewis Carroll, the inference from “I believe what-
ever I say” to “I say whatever I believe” is not valid,
because there are inferences of identical form in which
the premise is true and the conclusion false, such as the
inference from “I see whatever I eat” to “I eat whatever
I see.”
   The scope of Aristotle’s logic is limited by the lim-
ited range of forms of potential premises and conclu-
sions he recognizes. In fact, he recognized only four:
the universal affirmative “All A’s are B’s,” the univer-
sal negative “No A’s are B’s,” the particular affirmative
“Some A’s are B’s,” and the particular negative “Some
A’s are not B’s” or “Not all A’s are B’s.” The premise
“I believe whatever I say” amounts to “All things that
I say are things that I believe,” and hence is a univer-
sal affirmative. The invalidity of the inference in the
Lewis Carroll example exemplifies the invalidity of the
inference from “All A’s are B’s” to “All B’s are A’s.”
The validity of the inference from the two premises
“All Greeks are human beings” and “All human beings
are mortal” to the conclusion “All Greeks are mortal”
exemplifies the validity of the inference from “All A’s
are B’s” and “All B’s are C’s” to “All A’s are C’s,” tradi-
tion ally called the “syllogism in Barbara,” for reasons
that need not concern us here. Aristotle’s logic was in
part inspired by the practice of deduction in philosoph-
ical debate (“dialectic”) and in part by the practice of
deduction in mathematical theorem-proving (“demon-
st ration”), and he offers in his Posterior Analytics an
account of a deductive science that is presumed to be
based on the practice of the contemporary geometer
Eudoxus, in the same sense and to the same degree
in which his account in the Poetics of tragedy is based
on the practice of the contemporary playwright Euripi-
des. But, in fact, Aristotle’s logic is inadequate for the
analysis of mathematicians’ actual arguments, because
he makes no provision for forms of argument involv-
ing relations. He cannot, for instance, analyze properly
the valid argument from “All squares are rectangles”
to “Anyone who draws a square draws a rectangle,”
because he has no way of representing adequately the
form of the conclusion.

VII. The Influence of Mathematics
By contrast, if you open any present-day intro duc-
represent symbolically the forms of arguments involv-
ing relations. The example just given would appear
∀x(Square(x) → Rectangle(x))
∴   ∀y(∃x(Square(x) & Draws(y, x)) →
∃x(Rectangle(x) & Draws(y, x))).
In words this would amount to the following. For every
x, if x is a square, then x is a rectangle. Therefore,
for every y, if there is an x such that x is a square
and y draws x, then there exists an x such that x is a
rectangle and y draws x. (Thus “→” means “if . . . , then
. . . ,” “∀” means “for every,” and “∃” means “there is.”)
This style of logical analysis is the invention of Frege.
Underlying it is a notion of a “concept” as a special
kind of function, a function that (generalizing the math-
ematical notion in one direction) need not be given by
any kind of mathematical description, and that (gener-
alizing the mathematical notion in another direction)
need not have as arguments any kind of numbers. A
concept for Frege is a function whose argument or argu-
ments may be any objects at all, and whose values are
Truth and Falsehood. Thus, the concept Wise applied
to the argument Socrates produces the value Truth,
since Socrates is wise (at least to the extent of recog-
nizing that he lacked perfect wisdom), while the con-
cept Immortal applied to Socrates produces Falsehood,
since Socrates was not immortal but died of drinking
hemlock. Frege is able to handle relations because he
follows the mathematical analysts who allowed func-
tions of two or more arguments. Thus the two-argument
concept or relation Taught applied to Socrates and
Plato, in that order, produces Truth, since Socrates
taught Plato, while applied to Plato and Socrates, in that
order, produces Falsehood, since Plato did not teach
Socrates. Aristotle’s simple “All A’s are B’s” becomes,
for Frege, the more complex “For all objects x, if A(x),
then B(x).” At the price of such extra complexity,
he is able to logically analyze arguments turning on
relations, as Aristotle was not.
Aristotle analyzed the concept Human Being in terms
of the concepts Animal and Rational in the sense
of “language-using.” In present-day textbook notation
(writing “↔” for “if and only if”), this would be
Human(x) ↔ Animal(x) & Rational(x).
But Aristotle, with no theory of relations, was unable
to analyze the notion of Mother (respectively, Father)

VII.12.   Analysis, Mathematical and Philosophical

in terms of Female (respectively, Male) and Parent. For
Frege, Mother is analyzed as follows:

A mother is a female who is some one’s parent, and
analogously for a father. Frege was even able to ana-
lyze the concept Ancestor in terms of the concept Par-
ent, though this analysis is beyond the scope of the
present sketch. Later philosophical analysis would have
been unthinkable with out Frege’s broadening of logi-
cal analysis beyond Aristotle’s, and Frege rightly saw
his broadening of logical analysis as a direct extrapo-
lation from the nineteenth-century mathematical ana-
lysts’ broadening of the notion of function they had
inherited from their eighteenth-century predecessors.

Like Frege, Russell found in mathematics both a source
of problems and a source of methods. For the pur-
poses of a specialized investigation of problems in
the philosophy of mathematics, he created an instru-
ment, his theory of descriptions, and a more general
method, that of contextual definition, which his suc-
cessors took up and applied to many other problem
areas. Indeed, it was not merely Russell’s successors
who applied these ideas to areas out side philosophy of
mathematics, since Russell himself did so in his first
publications on the subject. Thus it is not apparent
from Russell’s still widely read “On denoting,” pub-
lished in 1905 and even today a key item on the syllabus
of students of analytic philosophy, that the theory of
descriptions originated in the course of studies in foun-    simply to deny this:
da tions and philosophy of mathematics. Rather, this is
a fact mentioned in Russell’s autobiographical writings
and known to historians of twentieth-century philoso-
phy. The degree to which the method of contextual def-
inition, which the theory of descriptions exemplifies,
was inspired by the nineteenth-century rigorization of
analysis is perhaps not sufficiently appreciated even by
such specialists.
   A principal puzzle Russell addresses in “On denot-
ing” is that of so-called negative existentials, such as     sell’s theory, whose main point should be clear from
“The king of France does not exist.” In superficial gram-     these few examples: when the logical form is properly
mat ical form this statement resembles “The queen of
England does not agree,” and to that extent it appears
to involve picking out an object (in this case, a person),   With it vanishes any appearance that we must acknow-
and then attributing a property to him (or her, as the
case may be). Thus it seems that in order to say that
some one or something does not exist, one must assume

933

of Husserl’s teacher Franz Brentano) as a philosopher
committed to such a view. For Meinong had a theory
of “objects beyond being and non being,” exemplified
by The Golden Mountain and The Round Square. But
as Scott Soames reveals, in his Philosophical Analysis in
the Twentieth Century, volume I: The Dawn of Analy-
sis, Russell himself had briefly held a similar view in
the first days of his and Moore’s joint rebellion against
absolute idealism. It was through the development of
his theory of descriptions that Russell was able to free
himself from anything like commitment to Meinongian
“objects.”

Russell’s Theory of Descriptions
golden and a mountain: ∃x(Golden(x) & Mountain(x)).
To say that the Golden Mountain exists is to say that
there is one thing that is both golden and a mountain
and no other such thing:
∃x(Golden(x) & Mountain(x)
& ∼∃y(Golden(y) & Mountain(y) & y ≠ x)).
(Here “∼” represents “it is not the case that.”) This is
logically equivalent to saying there is something such
that a thing is both golden and a mountain if and only
if it is identical with that thing:
∃x∀y(Golden(y) & Mountain(y) ↔ y = x).
To say that the Golden Mountain does not exist is
∼∃x∀y(Golden(y) & Mountain(y) ↔ y = x).
To say that the king of France is bald is, similarly, to
say that there is something such that a thing is king of
France if and only if it is identical with that thing, and
that thing is bald:
∃x(∀y(King-of-France(y) ↔ y = x) & Bald(x)).

of France even in order to deny that any such object
exists. The examples illustrate in miniature two lessons:

first, that the logical form of a statement may differ sig-   outraged critics like Berkeley. In the course of the

nition of this difference may be the key to solving or
dissolving a philosophical problem; second, that the

   Russell’s distinction between grammatical and logi-
cal form, and his claim that the former may be system-
at ically misleading, was to prove immensely influen-
tial, even among nontechnically oriented philosophers,

   Contextual definition was the tool the rigorizers used    kind of philosophical genius in formed by knowledge of
to dispel the mysteries surrounding the notions of
infinitesimals and infinities in the calculus. The fol-
lowers of Leibniz had, for instance, written df (x)/dx
for the derivative of a function f (x), where in dx was
supposed to represent an “infinitesimal” change in the
argument, and df (x) a corresponding “infinitesimal”
change f (x + dx) − f (x) in the value when the argu-
ment changes from x to x + dx. (Leibniz claimed that
this was all just a figure of speech, but his followers
seem to have taken it literally.) These infinitesimals
could be treated as nonzero in some circumstances—
in particular, one could divide by them, as one cannot
divide by zero—and yet treated as zero and neglected
in other circumstances. Thus the derivative of the
function f (x) = x 2 was computed as follows:
   df (x)     f (x + dx) − f (x)   (x + dx)2 − x 2

Here dx is treated as nonzero at the next-to-last step,     Hegelian or absolute idealist metaphysicians on, as a

infinitesimals df (x) and dx was explained away, the
true form being (d/dx)f (x), indicating the application
of an operation of differentiation d/dx applied to a
function f (x).
Similarly, such an expression as limx→0 1/x = . nfty, or
“the limit of 1/x as x goes to zero is infinity,” was
explained as a whole, with out requiring any explana-
tion of “. nfty” or “infinity” taken separately. The details,
which now appear in any freshman calculus textbook,
need not detain us. What is important historically is
that the notion of contextual definition employed in
Russell’s theory of descriptions was an idea that would

and Analytic Philosophy
Anyone who acquires a new tool is in some danger of
be having like the proverbial man with a hammer to
whom everything seems to be a nail. There is no deny-
ing that some of the first people to apply the new meth-
ods of Frege and Russell were over enthusiastic about
what such methods could accomplish. Russell himself,
having established to his own satisfaction that math-
ematics could be reduced to pure logic once one had
a sufficiently rich and powerful logic, went on to con-
clude that every science apart from mathematics could
be reduced to logical compounds of statements about
immediate sensory impressions—“sense data” as they
